united nations 1. a guide to the green economy 1. introduction sustainable development has been the overarching goal of the international community since the un conference on environment and development unced in 1992. amongst numerous commitments, the conference called upon governments to develop national strategies for sustainable development, incorporating policy measures outlined in the rio declaration and agenda 21. despite the efforts of many governments around the world to implement such strategies as well as international cooperation to support national governments, there are continuing concerns over global economic and environmental developments in many countries.'\n 'these have been intensified by recent prolonged global energy, food and financial crises, and underscored by continued warnings from global scientists that society is in danger of transgressing a number of planetary boundaries or ecological limits1.'\n 'with governments today seeking effective ways to lead their nations out of these related crises whilst also taking into account these ecological limits, green economy in its various forms has been proposed as a means for catalysing renewed national policy development and international cooperation and support for sustainable development.'\n 'the concept has received significant international attention over the past few years as a tool to address the 2008 financial crisis as well as one of two themes for the 2012 un conference on sustainable development rio 20 .'\n 'this has resulted in a rapidly expanding literature including new publications on green economy from a variety of influential international organisations, national governments, think tanks, experts, non government organisations and others.'\n 'despite the growing international interest in green economy, negotiations among member states on the concept in the lead up to rio 20 were challenging.'\n 'this was partly due to the lack of an internationally agreed definition or universal principles for green economy, the emergence of interrelated but different terminology and concepts over recent years such as green growth, low carbon development, sustainable economy, steady state economy etc.'\n ', a lack of clarity around what green economy policy measures encompass and how they integrate with national priorities and objectives relating to economic growth and poverty eradication, as well as a perceived lack of experience in designing, implementing and reviewing the costs and benefits of green economy policies.'\n 'recent publications on green economy or green growth by the united nations environment program unep , the un department of economic and social affairs undesa , the united nations conference on trade and development unctad , the international labour organisation ilo , the world bank, the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd , the global green growth institute gggi , the green economy coalition, stakeholder forum, the green growth leaders and many others have begun to address these knowledge gaps and demystify these concepts.'\n 'importantly, there is also emerging practice in the design and implementation of national green economy strategies by both developed and developing countries across most 1 cf.'\n 'state of the planet declaration , planet under pressure 2012, 26 29 march, london, which refers to humanity s impact on the earth system and to researchers first steps to identify planetary and regional thresholds and boundaries that, if crossed, could generate unacceptable environmental and social change para.'\n '7 a1.'

guide to the green economy regions, including africa, latin america, the asia pacific and europe.'\n 'this emerging practice can help to provide some important insights and much needed clarity regarding the types of green economy policy measures, their scope with regard to various sectors and national priorities, and their institutional barriers, risks and implementation costs as well as environmental, social and economic benefits.'\n 'this international experience may serve to alleviate concerns regarding the effective integration of green economy policies with national economic and social priorities and objectives, including the achievement of internationally agreed development goals.'\n 'this document aims to provide an overview of recent literature on green economy and the related concepts of green growth and low carbon development and other variations such as low emissions development or low carbon growth .'\n 'the overview provides a brief history of these concepts and brings together recent publications from international organisations, think tanks, experts, political groups, governments, non government organisations and others, most of which are freely available on the internet.'\n 'recent national green economy, green growth and low carbon development strategies are also provided.'\n 'in most cases, a web link and citation have been provided so that the reader can find out more information or reference the document as necessary.'\n '2. related concepts green economy, green growth and low carbon development whilst the concept of green economy has only recently gained significant international attention, green economy policies have been discussed and analysed for some decades by economists and academics, particularly in the fields of environmental and ecological economics.'\n 'green economy policy measures have also been discussed at length in international negotiations, including unced in rio in 1992. for example, the rio declaration included principles promoting the internalisation of environmental costs and the use of economic instruments principle 16 as well as eliminating unsustainable consumption and production principle 8 .'\n 'agenda 21 further elaborated on these principles and called for the development of national strategies for sustainable development incorporating measures for integrating environment and development, providing effective legal and regulatory frameworks, making effective use of economic instruments and market and other incentives, and establishing systems for integrated environmental and economic accounting chapter 8 .'\n 'ten years later, the johannesburg plan of implementation jpoi also identified the need to change the way societies produce and consume, and called for the development of a 10 year framework of programmes for sustainable consumption and production.'\n 'the first marrakech, june 2003 and the second san jose, september 2005 international expert meetings emphasised the need to promote social and economic development within the carrying capacity of the environment, de link economic growth and environmental degradation through improving efficiency and sustainability in the use of resources and production processes, and reduce resource degradation, pollution and waste2.'\n '2 see http www.greengrowth.org 6 united nations 1. a guide to the green economy the rio conference in 1992 also produced the un framework convention on climate change unfccc , which has involved prolonged debate regarding potential economic, regulatory and market based measures to address climate change through low carbon development.'\n 'in recent negotiations under this convention, it has been agreed that low emission development strategies leds that adopt appropriate policy measures for low carbon development are indispensible for achieving sustainable development.'\n 'this section provides a brief overview of the recent history of three interrelated concepts that have gained significant attention in recent years in the context of catalysing efforts to achieve sustainable development green economy, green growth and low carbon development.'\n 'it is acknowledged that this is not a finite list of approaches, models or tools proposed for achieving sustainable development, but rather is a subset of approaches that have gained prominence in recent years in the context of international negotiations and amongst influential international organisations.'\n 'sections 3, 4 and 5 below provide a brief history of each of the concepts and recent definitions, as well as a summary of recent publications and national strategies that are available online.'\n 'this list is not exhaustive and, with new publications being released every other day, it is intended that this guidebook be a working document that will be regularly updated.'\n 'section 6 provides a brief critique of these concepts.'\n '3. green economy the term green economy was first coined in a pioneering 1989 report for the government of the united kingdom by a group of leading environmental economists, entitled blueprint for a green economy pearce, markandya and barbier, 1989 .'\n 'the report was commissioned to advise the uk government if there was a consensus definition to the term sustainable development and the implications of sustainable development for the measurement of economic progress and the appraisal of projects and policies3.'\n 'apart from in the title of the report, there is no further reference to green economy and it appears that the term was used as an afterthought by the authors.'\n 'in 1991 and 1994 the authors released sequels to the first report entitled blueprint 2 greening the world economy and blueprint 3 measuring sustainable development.'\n 'whilst the theme of the first blueprint report was that economics can and should come to the aid of environmental policy, the sequels extended this message to global problems climate change, ozone depletion, tropical deforestation, and resource loss in the developing world.'\n 'all reports built upon research and practice in environmental economics spanning back several decades.'\n 'in 2008, the term was revived in the context of discussions on the policy response to multiple global crises.'\n 'in the context of the financial crisis and concerns of a global recession, unep championed the idea of green stimulus packages and identified specific areas where large scale public investment could kick start a green economy atkisson, 2012 .'\n 'it inspired several governments to implement significant green stimulus packages as part of their economic recovery efforts.'\n '3 the report interprets sustainable development as non declining human welfare over time that is, a development path that makes people better off today but makes people tomorrow have a lower standard of living is not sustainable.'\n '7 united nations 1. a guide to the green economy in october 2008, unep launched its green economy initiative to provide analysis and policy support for investment in green sectors and for greening resource and or pollution intensive sectors.'\n 'as part of this initiative, unep commissioned one of the original authors of blueprint for a green economy to prepare a report entitled a global green new deal ggnd , which was released in april 2009 and proposed a mix of policy actions that would stimulate economic recovery and at the same time improve the sustainability of the world economy.'\n 'the ggnd called on governments to allocate a significant share of stimulus funding to green sectors and set out three objectives i economic recovery ii poverty eradication and iii reduced carbon emissions and ecosystem degradation it also proposed a framework for green stimulus programs as well as supportive domestic and international policies unemg, 2011 .'\n 'in june 2009, in the lead up to the un climate change conference in copenhagen, the un released an interagency statement supporting the green economy as a transformation to address multiple crises4.'\n 'the statement included the hope that the economic recovery would be the turning point for an ambitious and effective international response to the multiple crises facing humanity based on a global green economy.'\n 'in february 2010, ministers and heads of delegation of the unep global ministerial environment forum in nusa dua acknowledged in their declaration that the green economy concept can significantly address current challenges and deliver economic development opportunities and multiple benefits for all nations.'\n 'it also acknowledged unep s leading role in further defining and promoting the concept and encouraged unep to contribute to this work through the preparatory process for the un conference on sustainable development in 2012 rio 20 .'\n 'in march 2010, the general assembly agreed that green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication would form one of the two specific themes for rio 20 resolution 64 236 .'\n 'this led to a great deal of international attention on green economy and related concepts and the publication of numerous reports and other literature aiming to further define and demystify the concept.'\n 'one of the key reports was the flagship green economy report released by unep in november 2011 under its green economy initiative.'\n 'unep partnered with think tanks and commercial actors including deutsche bank , lending credibility to its economic analyses atkisson, 2012 .'\n 'importantly, the report also provides a working definition of green economy which has since been cited in numerous other publications.'\n 'a series of other publications by unep, unctad, undesa and the uncsd secretariat have attempted to elaborate on the concept and outline guiding principles, benefits, risks and emerging international experience5.'\n 'in december 2011, the un environment management group a system wide coordination body of over 40 specialized agencies, programmes and organs of the united nations also released its system wide perspective on green economy

2011 green economy report.'\n 'a number of non government organizations and partnerships have also developed in recent years which aim to promote green economy as a concept and undertake research, analysis and outreach6.'\n 'there is no internationally agreed definition of green economy and at least eight separate definitions were identified in recent publications see appendix 1 .'\n 'for example, unep has defined the green economy as one that results in improved human well being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities.'\n 'it is low carbon, resource efficient, and socially inclusive unep, 2011 .'\n 'this definition has been cited in a number of more recent reports, including by the unemg and the oecd.'\n 'another definition for green economy offered by the green economy coalition a group of ngos, trade union groups and others doing grassroots work on a green economy succinctly defines green economy as a resilient economy that provides a better quality of life for all within the ecological limits of the planet.'\n '3.a.'\n 'publications following is a summary of recent green economy publications available online.'\n 'towards a green economy pathways to sustainable development and poverty eradication unep this publication aims to set the stage for the transition to a green economy.'\n 'the report provides evidence that the transition has sound economic and social justification and offers governments and the private sector means to contribute to the shift.'\n 'opportunities for government include phasing out antiquated subsidies, reforming policiescture and and providing new incentives, strengthening market infrastruening market based mechanisms, redirecting public investment and grepublic procurement.'\n 'options for the private sector may include understanding the opportunity arising from a green economic transitionand responding to policy reforms and price signals through higher levels of finance and investment.'\n ', the report identifies the main failings of our current economic paradigm and highlights the causes and what can be done to reverse negative trends.'\n 'a substantial section is devoted to defining what a green economy might look like, the relationship between the term green economy and the terms sustainable development and poverty eradication , and how far we currently are from a true green economy.'\n 'in relation to the latter, the report provides options for measuring progress towards a green economy and begins to explore how a green economy might perform over time.'\n 'the green economy is defined by unep as one that results in improved human well being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities.'\n 'download here 6 for example, see the green economy coalition http www.greeneconomycoalition.org 9 united nations 1. a guide to the green economy citation united nations environment programme, 2011.

through the work of different organisations and with different target audiences, the distinctions among them have become blurred and they are now being used almost interchangeably.'\n 'a main driver behind the development of these concepts has been the move towards a more integrated and holistic approach to incorporating environment and development in economic decision making, policy and planning.'\n 'whilst the terms green economy and green growth might imply a strong focus on the intersection between environment and the economy, many of the definitions of these terms from recent publications clearly also incorporate a social emphasis see appendix 1 .'\n 'a summary of key words from the full list of definitions in appendix 1 is provided in table 1 below, categorised according to the three dimensions of sustainable development.'\n 'table 1 keywords in published definitions of green economy and green growth dimension green economy green growth social economic human well being social equity socially inclusive reduced inequalities better quality of life social development equitable access addressing needs of women and youth.'\n 'well being, socially inclusive, access to basic commodities for the impoverished meeting demands for food production, transport, construction, housing and energy.'\n 'growth in income and employment public and private investments resilient economy economic growth new economic activity.'\n 'economic growth and development technology and innovation environmentally sustainable economic progress more resilient sustained economic growth driver for economic growth new growth engines green technology new job opportunities qualitative growth rather than simply increasing gdp job creation or gdp growth.'\n 'protection and maintenance of natural assets and environmental services provision of resources and services low carbon using fewer resources and generating fewer emissions resource efficient cleaner climatic and environmental sustainability energy and resource efficient minimises pollution and environmental impacts resilient to hazards harmony between the economy and the environment environmental protection reduce ghg.'\n 'environmental reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities low carbon resource efficient reduce carbon emissions and pollution enhance energy and resource efficiency prevent loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services within ecological limits of the planet environmental responsibility finite carrying capacity.'\n 'whilst this analysis is illustrative, there is clearly significant overlap between the two concepts, including language around growth and economic development, environmental protection, low carbon development, resilience, resource efficiency, ecological sustainability, human well being, inclusiveness and equity.'\n 'in this regard, low carbon development can be seen as a subset of both green growth and green economy.'\n 'importantly, many definitions of green economy include a 60 united nations 1. a guide to the green economy reference to ecological limits or planetary boundaries, which are references to the scientific article which identifies nine planetary boundaries that define the safe operating space for humanity with respect to the earth system and associated with the planet s biophysical subsystems or processes see rockstrom et al, 2009 .'\n 'interestingly, this reference has not been included in definitions of green growth.'\n 'the international chamber of commerce 2011 propose a key difference between green growth and green economy i.e.'\n 'that green growth is a bottom up approach of greening products, processes, services, technologies and supply chains, compared with the top down approach of green economy which involves strategic, macro economic policies addressing systemic challenges.'\n 'others highlight that green growth, more so than the multidimensional concept of green economy, represents a new global compromise position, which may be seen as a weak step forward but one that has the potential to unite many different factions around a goal that many see as transformative atkisson, 2012 .'\n 'overall, the various definitions of green growth and green economy are generally consistent, both having sustainable development as their ultimate objective and being a means to reconcile the economic and environmental pillars, without ignoring social aspects world bank, 2012 .'\n 'as such, the distinction between the terms is probably of little relevance.'\n 'however, the approaches to green economy and green growth can be seen to cover a spectrum of different shades of green , from narrow concerns about climate change on the one hand in line with initial approaches to low carbon growth , to larger critiques of the environmental sustainability of modern capitalism on the other green growth leaders, 2011 .'\n 'in other words, and from a scientific perspective, the focus varies between addressing one of the planetary boundaries defined by scientists i.e.'\n 'climate change to more holistically addressing the wider range of resource and ecological limits and the general state of the planet.'\n 'of course, green economy has not been without its critics10.'\n 'criticisms raised include that the concept should not compete with or displace sustainable development and internationally agreed principles, that it implies a focus on environmental and economic dimensions to the detriment of the social dimension, that it will lead to the financialisation of nature as well as further concentration of market power and global inequality third world network, 2011 lander, 2011 .'\n 'other risks associated with green economy include that it may attempt to treat countries in the same manner i.e.'\n 'be based on a one size fits all approach , that it may result in trade protectionism, that through it some countries may attempt to gain enhanced market access for their products, achieving commercial advantage, and that it may place new conditionalities on developing countries for aid, loans and debt relief khor, 2011 .'\n 'critics have also highlighted its failure to do justice to the interdependent relationship between environment protection and inclusive economic and social development dagupta, 2011 khor, 2011 third world network, 2011 .'\n 'in the context of rio 20, the relationship of green economy as a means to achieving broader sustainable development and poverty eradication was given a clear emphasis.'\n 'more recent references to an equitable green economy or inclusive green growth are clearly attempting more holistically to integrate the three dimensions of sustainable development 10 for example see the no to the green economy campaign http nogreeneconomy.org en 61 united nations 1. a guide to the green economy into these concepts to allay these concerns11 .'\n 'however, it has also been pointed out that, whilst this has been an important development, if one follows this track the green economy concept would incorporate so many additional aspects that the concept would become equivalent to sustainable development itself in that sense, why bother condezey, 2011 .'\n 'perhaps a key benefit of the emergence of the green economy concept has been that it has stimulated international attention and renewed global efforts to transform our current unsustainable economic model into one which better aligns with the overarching goals of sustainable development.'\n 'importantly, this has included efforts by international organizations, major groups, think tanks and researchers both supporters and critics alike to develop operational principles for green economy and green growth, as well as the elaboration of policy toolkits and suites of measures that can be adopted by national governments to shift to a more sustainable economic framework.'\n 'there is also an emerging international practice as national governments in all regions adopt what could be classified as green economy policies, with some countries taking a leading role in developing overarching national green economy strategies that integrate with long term development strategies.'\n 'in this regard, the green economy and related concepts have succeeded in reinvigorating global debate on how to redefine our economic model to achieve the overarching agreed goal of sustainable development.'\n 'it is likely that the concepts of green economy and green growth will further converge in coming years and continue to gather momentum as more influential international organizations as well as national governments adopt the concepts into their programs and policy agendas.'\n 'during this process, it will be critical that proponents of green economy effectively take onboard the concerns raised and address the risks associated with the concept.'\n 'the development of agreed green economy principles, policy toolkits and databases of good practice will contribute in this regard.'\n '11 for example see recent publications by the world bank 2012 inclusive green growth the pathway to sustainable development the un emg 2011 working towards a balanced and inclusive green economy a united nations system wide perspective and the danish 92 group 2012 building an equitable green economy.'\n '62

united nations 1. a guide to the green economy 1. introduction sustainable development has been the overarching goal of the international community since the un conference on environment and development unced in 1992. amongst numerous commitments, the conference called upon governments to develop national strategies for sustainable development, incorporating policy measures outlined in the rio declaration and agenda 21. despite the efforts of many governments around the world to implement such strategies as well as international cooperation to support national governments, there are continuing concerns over global economic and environmental developments in many countries.'\n 'these have been intensified by recent prolonged global energy, food and financial crises, and underscored by continued warnings from global scientists that society is in danger of transgressing a number of planetary boundaries or ecological limits1.'\n 'with governments today seeking effective ways to lead their nations out of these related crises whilst also taking into account these ecological limits, green economy in its various forms has been proposed as a means for catalysing renewed national policy development and international cooperation and support for sustainable development.'\n 'the concept has received significant international attention over the past few years as a tool to address the 2008 financial crisis as well as one of two themes for the 2012 un conference on sustainable development rio 20 .'\n 'this has resulted in a rapidly expanding literature including new publications on green economy from a variety of influential international organisations, national governments, think tanks, experts, non government organisations and others.'\n 'despite the growing international interest in green economy, negotiations among member states on the concept in the lead up to rio 20 were challenging.'\n 'this was partly due to the lack of an internationally agreed definition or universal principles for green economy, the emergence of interrelated but different terminology and concepts over recent years such as green growth, low carbon development, sustainable economy, steady state economy etc.'\n ', a lack of clarity around what green economy policy measures encompass and how they integrate with national priorities and objectives relating to economic growth and poverty eradication, as well as a perceived lack of experience in designing, implementing and reviewing the costs and benefits of green economy policies.'\n 'recent publications on green economy or green growth by the united nations environment program unep , the un department of economic and social affairs undesa , the united nations conference on trade and development unctad , the international labour organisation ilo , the world bank, the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd , the global green growth institute gggi , the green economy coalition, stakeholder forum, the green growth leaders and many others have begun to address these knowledge gaps and demystify these concepts.'\n 'importantly, there is also emerging practice in the design and implementation of national green economy strategies by both developed and developing countries across most 1 cf.'\n 'state of the planet declaration , planet under pressure 2012, 26 29 march, london, which refers to humanity s impact on the earth system and to researchers first steps to identify planetary and regional thresholds and boundaries that, if crossed, could generate unacceptable environmental and social change para.'\n '7 a1.'

guide to the green economy regions, including africa, latin america, the asia pacific and europe.'\n 'this emerging practice can help to provide some important insights and much needed clarity regarding the types of green economy policy measures, their scope with regard to various sectors and national priorities, and their institutional barriers, risks and implementation costs as well as environmental, social and economic benefits.'\n 'this international experience may serve to alleviate concerns regarding the effective integration of green economy policies with national economic and social priorities and objectives, including the achievement of internationally agreed development goals.'\n 'this document aims to provide an overview of recent literature on green economy and the related concepts of green growth and low carbon development and other variations such as low emissions development or low carbon growth .'\n 'the overview provides a brief history of these concepts and brings together recent publications from international organisations, think tanks, experts, political groups, governments, non government organisations and others, most of which are freely available on the internet.'\n 'recent national green economy, green growth and low carbon development strategies are also provided.'\n 'in most cases, a web link and citation have been provided so that the reader can find out more information or reference the document as necessary.'\n '2. related concepts green economy, green growth and low carbon development whilst the concept of green economy has only recently gained significant international attention, green economy policies have been discussed and analysed for some decades by economists and academics, particularly in the fields of environmental and ecological economics.'\n 'green economy policy measures have also been discussed at length in international negotiations, including unced in rio in 1992. for example, the rio declaration included principles promoting the internalisation of environmental costs and the use of economic instruments principle 16 as well as eliminating unsustainable consumption and production principle 8 .'\n 'agenda 21 further elaborated on these principles and called for the development of national strategies for sustainable development incorporating measures for integrating environment and development, providing effective legal and regulatory frameworks, making effective use of economic instruments and market and other incentives, and establishing systems for integrated environmental and economic accounting chapter 8 .'\n 'ten years later, the johannesburg plan of implementation jpoi also identified the need to change the way societies produce and consume, and called for the development of a 10 year framework of programmes for sustainable consumption and production.'\n 'the first marrakech, june 2003 and the second san jose, september 2005 international expert meetings emphasised the need to promote social and economic development within the carrying capacity of the environment, de link economic growth and environmental degradation through improving efficiency and sustainability in the use of resources and production processes, and reduce resource degradation, pollution and waste2.'\n '2 see http www.greengrowth.org 6 united nations 1. a guide to the green economy the rio conference in 1992 also produced the un framework convention on climate change unfccc , which has involved prolonged debate regarding potential economic, regulatory and market based measures to address climate change through low carbon development.'\n 'in recent negotiations under this convention, it has been agreed that low emission development strategies leds that adopt appropriate policy measures for low carbon development are indispensible for achieving sustainable development.'\n 'this section provides a brief overview of the recent history of three interrelated concepts that have gained significant attention in recent years in the context of catalysing efforts to achieve sustainable development green economy, green growth and low carbon development.'\n 'it is acknowledged that this is not a finite list of approaches, models or tools proposed for achieving sustainable development, but rather is a subset of approaches that have gained prominence in recent years in the context of international negotiations and amongst influential international organisations.'\n 'sections 3, 4 and 5 below provide a brief history of each of the concepts and recent definitions, as well as a summary of recent publications and national strategies that are available online.'\n 'this list is not exhaustive and, with new publications being released every other day, it is intended that this guidebook be a working document that will be regularly updated.'\n 'section 6 provides a brief critique of these concepts.'\n '3. green economy the term green economy was first coined in a pioneering 1989 report for the government of the united kingdom by a group of leading environmental economists, entitled blueprint for a green economy pearce, markandya and barbier, 1989 .'\n 'the report was commissioned to advise the uk government if there was a consensus definition to the term sustainable development and the implications of sustainable development for the measurement of economic progress and the appraisal of projects and policies3.'\n 'apart from in the title of the report, there is no further reference to green economy and it appears that the term was used as an afterthought by the authors.'\n 'in 1991 and 1994 the authors released sequels to the first report entitled blueprint 2 greening the world economy and blueprint 3 measuring sustainable development.'\n 'whilst the theme of the first blueprint report was that economics can and should come to the aid of environmental policy, the sequels extended this message to global problems climate change, ozone depletion, tropical deforestation, and resource loss in the developing world.'\n 'all reports built upon research and practice in environmental economics spanning back several decades.'\n 'in 2008, the term was revived in the context of discussions on the policy response to multiple global crises.'\n 'in the context of the financial crisis and concerns of a global recession, unep championed the idea of green stimulus packages and identified specific areas where large scale public investment could kick start a green economy atkisson, 2012 .'\n 'it inspired several governments to implement significant green stimulus packages as part of their economic recovery efforts.'\n '3 the report interprets sustainable development as non declining human welfare over time that is, a development path that makes people better off today but makes people tomorrow have a lower standard of living is not sustainable.'\n '7 united nations 1. a guide to the green economy in october 2008, unep launched its green economy initiative to provide analysis and policy support for investment in green sectors and for greening resource and or pollution intensive sectors.'\n 'as part of this initiative, unep commissioned one of the original authors of blueprint for a green economy to prepare a report entitled a global green new deal ggnd , which was released in april 2009 and proposed a mix of policy actions that would stimulate economic recovery and at the same time improve the sustainability of the world economy.'\n 'the ggnd called on governments to allocate a significant share of stimulus funding to green sectors and set out three objectives i economic recovery ii poverty eradication and iii reduced carbon emissions and ecosystem degradation it also proposed a framework for green stimulus programs as well as supportive domestic and international policies unemg, 2011 .'\n 'in june 2009, in the lead up to the un climate change conference in copenhagen, the un released an interagency statement supporting the green economy as a transformation to address multiple crises4.'\n 'the statement included the hope that the economic recovery would be the turning point for an ambitious and effective international response to the multiple crises facing humanity based on a global green economy.'\n 'in february 2010, ministers and heads of delegation of the unep global ministerial environment forum in nusa dua acknowledged in their declaration that the green economy concept can significantly address current challenges and deliver economic development opportunities and multiple benefits for all nations.'\n 'it also acknowledged unep s leading role in further defining and promoting the concept and encouraged unep to contribute to this work through the preparatory process for the un conference on sustainable development in 2012 rio 20 .'\n 'in march 2010, the general assembly agreed that green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication would form one of the two specific themes for rio 20 resolution 64 236 .'\n 'this led to a great deal of international attention on green economy and related concepts and the publication of numerous reports and other literature aiming to further define and demystify the concept.'\n 'one of the key reports was the flagship green economy report released by unep in november 2011 under its green economy initiative.'\n 'unep partnered with think tanks and commercial actors including deutsche bank , lending credibility to its economic analyses atkisson, 2012 .'\n 'importantly, the report also provides a working definition of green economy which has since been cited in numerous other publications.'\n 'a series of other publications by unep, unctad, undesa and the uncsd secretariat have attempted to elaborate on the concept and outline guiding principles, benefits, risks and emerging international experience5.'\n 'in december 2011, the un environment management group a system wide coordination body of over 40 specialized agencies, programmes and organs of the united nations also released its system wide perspective on green economy

2011 green economy report.'\n 'a number of non government organizations and partnerships have also developed in recent years which aim to promote green economy as a concept and undertake research, analysis and outreach6.'\n 'there is no internationally agreed definition of green economy and at least eight separate definitions were identified in recent publications see appendix 1 .'\n 'for example, unep has defined the green economy as one that results in improved human well being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities.'\n 'it is low carbon, resource efficient, and socially inclusive unep, 2011 .'\n 'this definition has been cited in a number of more recent reports, including by the unemg and the oecd.'\n 'another definition for green economy offered by the green economy coalition a group of ngos, trade union groups and others doing grassroots work on a green economy succinctly defines green economy as a resilient economy that provides a better quality of life for all within the ecological limits of the planet.'\n '3.a.'\n 'publications following is a summary of recent green economy publications available online.'\n 'towards a green economy pathways to sustainable development and poverty eradication unep this publication aims to set the stage for the transition to a green economy.'\n 'the report provides evidence

'options for the private sector may include understanding the opportunity arising from a green economic transitionand responding to policy reforms and price signals through higher levels of finance and investment.'\n ', the report identifies the main failings of our current economic paradigm and highlights the causes and what can be done to reverse negative trends.'\n 'a substantial section is devoted to defining what a green economy might look like, the relationship between the term green economy and the terms sustainable development and poverty eradication , and how far we currently are from a true green economy.'\n 'in relation to the latter, the report provides options for measuring progress towards a green economy and begins to explore how a green economy might perform over time.'\n 'the green economy is defined by unep as one that results in improved human well being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities.'\n

'59 united nations 1. a guide to the green economy 6. a critique of emerging concepts whilst the concepts of green economy, green growth and low carbon development have emerged from different sources, through the work of different organisations and with different target audiences, the distinctions among them have become blurred and they are now being used almost interchangeably.'\n 'a main driver behind the development of these concepts has been the move towards a more integrated and holistic approach to incorporating environment and development in economic decision making, policy and planning.'\n 'whilst the terms green economy and green growth might imply a strong focus on the intersection between environment and the economy, many of the definitions of these terms from recent publications clearly also incorporate a social emphasis see appendix 1 .'\n 'a summary of key words from the full list of definitions in appendix 1 is provided in table 1 below, categorised according to the three dimensions of sustainable development.'\n 'table 1 keywords in published definitions of green economy and green growth dimension green economy green growth social economic human well being social equity socially inclusive reduced inequalities better quality of life social development equitable access addressing needs of women and youth.'\n 'well being, socially inclusive, access to basic commodities for the impoverished meeting demands for food production, transport, construction, housing and energy.'\n 'growth in income and employment public and private investments resilient economy economic growth new economic activity.'\n 'economic growth and development technology and innovation environmentally sustainable economic progress more resilient sustained economic growth driver for economic growth new growth engines green technology new job opportunities qualitative growth rather than simply increasing gdp job creation or gdp growth.'\n 'protection and maintenance of natural assets and environmental services provision of resources and services low carbon using fewer resources and generating fewer emissions resource efficient cleaner climatic and environmental sustainability energy and resource efficient minimises pollution and environmental impacts resilient to hazards harmony between the economy and the environment environmental protection reduce ghg.'\n 'environmental reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities low carbon resource efficient reduce carbon emissions and pollution enhance energy and resource efficiency prevent loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services within ecological limits of the planet environmental responsibility finite carrying capacity.'\n 'whilst this analysis is illustrative, there is clearly significant overlap between the two concepts, including language around growth and economic development, environmental protection, low carbon development, resilience, resource efficiency, ecological sustainability, human well being, inclusiveness and equity.'\n 'in this regard, low carbon development can be seen as a subset of both green growth and green economy.'\n 'importantly, many definitions of green economy include a 60 united nations 1. a guide to the green economy reference to ecological limits or planetary boundaries, which are references to the scientific article which identifies nine planetary boundaries that define the safe operating space for humanity with respect to the earth system and associated with the planet s biophysical subsystems or processes see rockstrom et al, 2009 .'\n 'interestingly, this reference has not been included in definitions of green growth.'\n 'the international chamber of commerce 2011 propose a key difference between green growth and green economy i.e.'\n 'that green growth is a bottom up approach of greening products, processes, services, technologies and supply chains, compared with the top down approach of green economy which involves strategic, macro economic policies addressing systemic challenges.'\n 'others highlight that green growth, more so than the multidimensional concept of green economy, represents a new global compromise position, which may be seen as a weak step forward but one that has the potential to unite many different factions around a goal that many see as transformative atkisson, 2012 .'\n 'overall, the various definitions of green growth and green economy are generally consistent, both having sustainable development as their ultimate objective and being a means to reconcile the economic and environmental pillars, without ignoring social aspects world bank, 2012 .'\n 'as such, the distinction between the terms is probably of little relevance.'\n 'however, the approaches to green economy and green growth can be seen to cover a spectrum of different shades of green , from narrow concerns about climate change on the one hand in line with initial approaches to low carbon growth , to larger critiques of the environmental sustainability of modern capitalism on the other green growth leaders, 2011 .'\n 'in other words, and from a scientific perspective, the focus varies between addressing one of the planetary boundaries defined by scientists i.e.'\n 'climate change to more holistically addressing the wider range of resource and ecological limits and the general state of the planet.'\n 'of course, green economy has not been without its critics10.'\n 'criticisms raised include that the concept should not compete with or displace sustainable development and internationally agreed principles, that it implies a focus on environmental and economic dimensions to the detriment of the social dimension, that it will lead to the financialisation of nature as well as further concentration of market power and global inequality third world network, 2011 lander, 2011 .'\n 'other risks associated with green economy include that it may attempt to treat countries in the same manner i.e.'\n 'be based on a one size fits all approach , that it may result in trade protectionism, that through it some countries may attempt to gain enhanced market access for their products, achieving commercial advantage, and that it may place new conditionalities on developing countries for aid, loans and debt relief khor, 2011 .'\n 'critics have also highlighted its failure to do justice to the interdependent relationship between environment protection and inclusive economic and social development dagupta, 2011 khor, 2011 third world network, 2011 .'\n 'in the context of rio 20, the relationship of green economy as a means to achieving broader sustainable development and poverty eradication was given a clear emphasis.'\n 'more recent references to an equitable green economy or inclusive green growth are clearly attempting more holistically to integrate the three dimensions of sustainable development 10 for example see the no to the green economy campaign http nogreeneconomy.org en 61 united nations 1. a guide to the green economy into these concepts to allay these concerns11 .'\n 'however, it has also been pointed out that, whilst this has been an important development, if one follows this track the green economy concept would incorporate so many additional aspects that the concept would become equivalent to sustainable development itself in that sense, why bother condezey, 2011 .'\n 'perhaps a key benefit of the emergence of the green economy concept has been that it has stimulated international attention and renewed global efforts to transform our current unsustainable economic model into one which better aligns with the overarching goals of sustainable development.'\n 'importantly, this has included efforts by international organizations, major groups, think tanks and researchers both supporters and critics alike to develop operational principles for green economy and green growth, as well as the elaboration of policy toolkits and suites of measures that can be adopted by national governments to shift to a more sustainable economic framework.'\n 'there is also an emerging international practice as national governments in all regions adopt what could be classified as green economy policies, with some countries taking a leading role in developing overarching national green economy strategies that integrate with long term development strategies.'\n 'in this regard, the green economy and related concepts have succeeded in reinvigorating global debate on how to redefine our economic model to achieve the overarching agreed goal of sustainable development.'\n 'it is likely that the concepts of green economy and green growth will further converge in coming years and continue to gather momentum as more influential international organizations as well as national governments adopt the concepts into their programs and policy agendas.'\n 'during this process, it will be critical that proponents of green economy effectively take onboard the concerns raised and address the risks associated with the concept.'\n 'the development of agreed green economy principles, policy toolkits and databases of good practice will contribute in this regard.'\n '11 for example see recent publications by the world bank 2012 inclusive green growth the pathway to sustainable development the un emg 2011 working towards a balanced and inclusive green economy a united nations system wide perspective and the danish 92 group 2012 building an equitable green economy.'\n '62
