1	"Luigi is a Python (2.7, 3.6, 3.7 tested) package that helps you build complex pipelines of batch jobs. It handles dependency resolution, workflow management, visualization, handling failures, command line integration, and much more. "
1	"The purpose of Luigi is to address all the plumbing typically associated with long-running batch processes. You want to chain many tasks, automate them, and failures will happen. These tasks can be anything, but are typically long running things like Hadoop jobs, dumping data to/from databases, running machine learning algorithms, or anything else. "
1	"You can build pretty much any task you want, but Luigi also comes with a toolbox of several common task templates that you use. It includes support for running Python mapreduce jobs in Hadoop, as well as Hive, and Pig, jobs. It also comes with file system abstractions for HDFS, and local files that ensures all file system operations are atomic. This is important because it means your data pipeline will not crash in a state containing partial data. "
1	"It enables model training, test and feature extraction directly on Hadoop datasets stored in HDFS on Hadoop clusters. "
1	"It turns your Hadoop or Spark cluster(s) into a powerful platform for deep learning, without the need to set up a new dedicated cluster for deep learning separately. "
1	"Server-to-server direct communication (Ethernet or InfiniBand) achieves faster learning and eliminates scalability bottleneck. "
1	"Caffe users' existing datasets (e.g. LMDB) and configurations could be applied for distributed learning without any conversion needed. "
1	"High-level API empowers Spark applications to easily conduct deep learning. "
1	"Incremental learning is supported to leverage previously trained models or snapshots. "
1	"Additional data formats and network interfaces could be easily added. "
1	"It can be easily deployed on public cloud (ex. AWS EC2) or a private cloud. "
1	"Provides a system for simulating, comparing, testing, and benchmarking Spark applications and Spark itself. "

1	"User friendliness. Keras is an API designed for human beings, not machines. It puts user experience front and center. Keras follows best practices for reducing cognitive load: it offers consistent & simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear and actionable feedback upon user error. "
1	"Modularity. A model is understood as a sequence or a graph of standalone, fully configurable modules that can be plugged together with as few restrictions as possible. In particular, neural layers, cost functions, optimizers, initialization schemes, activation functions and regularization schemes are all standalone modules that you can combine to create new models. "
1	"Easy extensibility. New modules are simple to add (as new classes and functions), and existing modules provide ample examples. To be able to easily create new modules allows for total expressiveness, making Keras suitable for advanced research. "
1	"Work with Python. No separate models configuration files in a declarative format. Models are described in Python code, which is compact, easier to debug, and allows for ease of extensibility. "
