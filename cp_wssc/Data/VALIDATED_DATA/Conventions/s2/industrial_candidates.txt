transfer learning has been proven to be effective for the problems where training data from a source domain and test data from a target domain are from different distributions
such are mainly caused by the region between classes
however these from under poor numerical or even due to in observations of visual features with and the period of measurement integration
we further introduce a feedback connection from visual to the lower
