justifications based on renown and public opinion ["renown" worth] while all orders of justifications involve arguments designed to garner public support, the standard for judgment and evaluation of arguments in the other orders is not the extent of public knowledge or renown itself.	justification	renown
there are arguments and evaluations, however, which do point to the importance of public knowledge for determining the worth of a cause.	justification	renown
in the cases under review here, the mechanisms specifically designed for generating this valuable renown and fame are much more developed in the united states than in france, and arguments about the extent of public concern are more common in the united states there is even a sort of division of labor among the project opponents in the clavey case so that one organization, the tuolumne river preservation trust (trpt), is primarily responsible for promoting and managing public knowledge about the dispute (on a state and national level).	justification	renown
however, both cases involve attempts at gaining media attention or influencing the impressions of an audience who might not know the issues in depth.	justification	renown
more significantly, both cases involve denunciations of these sorts of "publicity" moves.	justification	renown
in the clavey dispute, advocates for both sides had at their disposal a well developed set of tools (used in political disputes of all sorts in the united states) for generating public and media attention, such as a fax network for press releases, slick bumper stickers (the opposition s read simply: "save the clavey"), guest editorials sent out to newspapers for consideration, slide shows, newsletters and mass mailings, endorsement campaigns and announcements, and a distinctly american form of pamphlet, the "alert".	justification	renown
interviews with key environmental leaders in the clavey dispute reveal they were explicitly concerned with making the clavey a well known issue, particularly among environmentally minded citizens in san francisco and nationwide, and among key elected officials such as national democratic congressional representatives who might endorse the opposition campaign.	justification	renown
trpt worked with national environmental groups including american rivers, which publishes an annual list of "the ten most endangered rivers" in the united states and generates a great deal of national media coverage.	justification	renown
the head of trpt, johanna thomas, said the national groups acted "kind of like a public relations firm for the river, because they had the ability to put out materials and reach a huge audience, much like advertisers do".	justification	renown
this advertisement for the river then paid crucial dividends in the form of pressure on the dam proponents to recognize that not just the politicians were against the dam but also masses of people from throughout the state and nation, many of whom wrote letters to government calling for a halt to the project.	justification	renown
she contends, "i think it was very threatening when [tid] saw that the clavey was getting this kind of attention".	justification	renown
the denunciation of these publicity efforts by the dam proponents also suggests the relevance and power of opinion claims.	justification	renown
mills attempts to play down the national renown of the clavey by pointing out that most of the people who wrote opposition letters were "outsiders" who would never see the river and had no "stake" in the dispute.	justification	renown
he characterized them as professional adversaries of any dams, who for that reason should have no weight in local decision making.	justification	renown
mills goes further to argue against judging the project in terms of opinion at all; he believes opinion evaluations are dangerous because opinion is so fickle and so easily manipulated by "public affairs gurus" and "spin doctors" who know how to "push buttons" on "whatever s popular right now".	justification	renown
another project supporter, shirley campbell, also acknowledged the importance of opinion on a local level.	justification	renown
she helped start the wise use group tucare partly because she wanted to counter the loud publicity from the environmentalists.	justification	renown
thus, the clavey dispute in the local area took on the appearance of a "public opinion war" because both sides effectively utilized the many tools available to them.	justification	renown
while public opinion is also at stake in the somport case, the goal of generating media attention and public notoriety is less explicitly pursued by the participants, and the mechanisms for renown are much less developed.	justification	renown
the famous singer of protest songs, renaud, made headlines when he came out against the tunnel, and he has continued to make dramatic public statements denouncing the tunnel.	justification	renown
also, there has been quite a lot of national and international press coverage of the large protests against the project.	justification	renown
but there has been some reaction against the press treatment of the project, partly because the press were considered "parisian" and not local.	justification	renown
finally, the minister of the environment, brice lalonde, has been denounced by opponents as being overly concerned with managing his image through his prominent role in the dispute.	justification	renown
the influential valley mayor, jacques lassalle, says in an interview: "mr. lalonde feels compelled to shine [il a besoin de briller] in paris".	justification	renown
overall, opinion judgments have not played the same central role in the somport dispute as they did in the clavey.	justification	renown
attracting the attention and influencing the opinion of politicians is another area of comparative difference.	justification	renown
this is an essential goal of both sides of the clavey conflict, and both sides were active in lobbying both directly and indirectly.	justification	renown
the opposition coalitions actively sought the endorsement of key legislators, and even took many legislators on rafting trips with the goal of letting them personally "experience" the clavey.	justification	renown
much attention was given by the media to a visit by senator barbara boxer to the region, when she came out against the dam.	justification	renown
again, the denunciations of these renown tactics also reveal the significance of public attention in contributing to the fate of the project.	justification	renown
shirley campbell and other local dam supporters saw senator boxer s public endorsement as a "purely political" ploy to win her votes by portraying her as the champion of everyday local folk and environmental awareness.	justification	renown
activists in the clavey case even developed ingenious methods for informing the public and prompting "ordinary citizens" to write to their legislators.	justification	renown
for example, rafting companies active in fighting the dam had their guides talk to the customers about the dispute and (when they felt they had convinced them) ask them to write letters to their representatives and to ferc.	justification	renown
john mills denounced this tactic also; he even sent in "spies" to take the rafting trip and report back on what the other side was telling the public.	justification	renown
lobbying is a much less common activity of either side in the somport case, and this is partly due to the fact that in france there are fewer direct budgetary or other ties between legislators and specific agencies like the ministry of environment.	justification	renown
but also the idea of lobbying trying to influence legislators outside of public settings or even publicly announcing endorsements of any one side in the dispute would rarely be considered legitimate in france, while it is often (but not always) considered a legitimate tactic in the united states.	justification	renown
an example of the denunciation of lobbying in france comes from someone (quoted in an english language news report) who believes lobbying had an influence in the french case: "it is incredible that as a consequence of the pro road lobby, comprised of lorry drivers, public works construction companies, and local politicians, work has begun on building a tunnel like this without having made a complete study of the project".	justification	renown
the world of renown the world of renown was drawn from hobbes\'s leviathan, particularly ,me chapter devoted to honor.	justification	renown
if, in a domestic world, worth has value only in a hierarchical chain of beings, worth is nothing but the result of other people\'s opinion in the world of renown.	justification	renown
the measurement of people\'s worth depends on conventional signs of public esteem.	justification	renown
this kind of worth is based on nothing other than the number of individuals who grant their recognition.	justification	renown
it is hence entirely unrelated to the realm of personal dependencies and it is not linked to the person\'s self esteem.	justification	renown
for this reason, disputes may arise when a gap between self esteem and recognition by others comes to light: in this world, other people\'s recognition is reality.	justification	renown
as a guide we used a training book in public relations, principes et techniques des relations publiques.	justification	renown
in this world, relevant persons are well known personalities, stars, opinion leaders, journalists.	justification	renown
they are worthy and great when they are famous, recognized, successful, or convincing.	justification	renown
the current objects in this world are trademarks, badges, message transmitters and receivers, press releases and booklets.	justification	renown
the right way of making relations is, then, to influence, to identify oneself to somebody, to appeal to or to speak about somebody, or to gossip and spread rumors.	justification	renown

the world of fame unlike the domestic world, but similar in this respect to the market world, the world of public opinion places little value on memory.	justification	renown
unlike the market world, it does not even recognize the form of memory of past tests that is constituted by the durability of money beyond the moment of the test during which it was transferred.	justification	renown
celebrities can be forgotten from one day to the next.	justification	renown
this is the feature andy warhol was alluding to in his famous announcement that a world is coming in which "everyone will have fifteen minutes of fame".	justification	renown
in the world of fame, there are few things that can consolidate and stabilize the relation between worth, which comes exclusively from the opinion of others, and the bearer of worth, an entity (person or thing) that is not qualified by properties scribed in its being in a lasting way.	justification	renown
this nonessentialist and purely relational character of the worth of fame may be precisely what has encouraged its adoption as a universal standard of measure by the schools of thought within the social sciences that like to highlight the structural and relativist properties of the social world.	justification	renown
but the same feature also makes this form of worth fragile and easy to criticize.	justification	renown
it is noteworthy that this form of worth was sketched out in texts that sought to criticize it well before it was established as a positive doctrine, and even today it still seems to be ill equipped to resist the many attacks that continue to be made on it.	justification	renown
in the world of fame, people may impose an order on beings and reach agreement in a just world by taking only the opinion of others into account.	justification	renown
it is opinion that establishes equivalence, and the worth of each being depends on the opinion of others: to a large extent, the reactions "of public opinion determine success".	justification	renown
persons are relevant inasmuch as they form a public whose "opinion prevails," a public "that creates public opinion" and thereby constitutes the only "true" reality: "isn\'t an opinion also a reality?"	justification	renown
fame establishes worth.	justification	renown
in the world of public opinion, worthy beings are the ones that distinguish themselves, are visible, famous, recognized: their visibility depends on their more or less attention getting, persuasive, informative character.	justification	renown
let us note that, in this world, the qualifiers of worth are applied without distinction to persons and to other beings, even though, as in the other worlds, only persons can reach the highest state.	justification	renown
people are all capable of reaching that state because they share the property of being moved by self love.	justification	renown
selflove is what creates their dignity as human beings.	justification	renown
they have a common desire to be recognized, a common craving for respect.	justification	renown
thus, for example, it is "for reasons of self love" that "the staff ... likes to be made aware of the role it plays".	justification	renown
in the same way, "questioned by someone from outside his own company ... , the participant wants to be able to explain what his own role is, and to be respected everywhere, since part of the reputation of the company for which he works reflects back on him".	justification	renown
since worth derives solely from opinion, the other qualities, and in particular one\'s profession, are not taken into account in the operation of establishing equivalences that makes it possible to identify personalities or stars.	justification	renown
a surgeon and an explorer may be equivalent when they are considered from the standpoint of fame: "when a cosmonaut, a famous surgeon who has done successful heart transplants, or a celebrated explorer is featured at a company event, this is certain to attract the attention of the public".	justification	renown
however, arrangements of worth may include persons who are neither big names nor their jam but who serve as judges responsible for focusing attention on the worth established by fame.	justification	renown
this is the case, for example, with opinion leaders "whose opinion prevails and who determine public opinion," journalists who judge whether or not public opinion is "receptive" or not, public relations agents, hostesses, spokespersom, and press agents.	justification	renown
access to fame, which is potentially possible from one day to the next for any being, however lacking in resources it may be, can also be supported by an arrangement of objects.	justification	renown
to make oneself known, it is a good idea to have a name, or, for products, a brand name, inscribed on a medium such as a label or a badge.	justification	renown
communicating an opinion to the largest possible number of persons allows fame to spread by contagion; this is accomplished within an arrangement that includes a "sender, a receiver, and a medium, an intermediary charged with conveying the message to its intended audience".	justification	renown
rooted in the world of fame (and not in the industrial or market world), a business enterprise can be thus defined as a sender addressing a receiver: "the sender, that is, the company, and the receiver, that is, the public".	justification	renown
an effective arrangement, a good campaign that makes it possible to plant an image, thus presupposes "a medium that is perfectly adapted to a specific message and capable of putting this message in the best light".	justification	renown
the tools that help establish the worth of fame include brochures, flyers, booklets, magazines, newsletters, books, public relation offices, audiovisual productions, press releases, and interviews.	justification	renown
it is essential to "have the (company] leaders interviewed if they are well known; it is obvious that via a statement made or a position taken by mr. x, a big name, the company of which mr. x is president will be in the limelight".	justification	renown
as instruments for the worth of fame, objects that represent compromises with the industrial and civic worlds may be used, for example, public opinion surveys; by means of an industrial apparatus, these supply a "yardstick for opinion" or for the penetration of a message, that is, "the fraction expressed in terms of the percentage of a population reached by a given medium".	justification	renown
however, in the logic of public opinion, this yardstick is sought not merely for its own sake, but also for the way it helps spread the message: "the increasingly frequent recourse to public opinion surveys allows us to state the following fact: the publication of results indicating that a majority of persons has a given opinion reinforces the opinion of these persons, underwriting it, as it were, and influencing the opinion of others".	justification	renown
the regular publication of surveys thus contributes to ensuring the transparency of the state of worthiness of famous beings who cannot hide the fluctuations of their standing.	justification	renown
having no secrets is the price paid, more generally, for reaching the state of worthiness in this world.	justification	renown
to be known, one must agree to reveal everything, keep nothing back, hide nothing from one\'s public.	justification	renown
"the public has a real allergy to secrets".	justification	renown
stars thus give up not only their private lives but also individual or personal attitudes, which are denigrated in this world as extravagances or whims that might displease the public at large.	justification	renown
similarly, one must abstain from any "esotericism" (a mode of expression that has high value in the inspired world), for this mode is treated as a manifestation of ostracism with respect to the majority.	justification	renown
"if a message, some bit of information, is too esoteric, only the most sophisticated sector of the public at large will be reached, while the rest, that is, the vast majority, will fail to perceive let alone understand and remember anything at all.	justification	renown
as a result, every act aimed at public opinion has to be carried out in relation to the least sophisticated sector, which implies that the same information must also be delivered to the most sophisticated sector".	justification	renown
in the world of public opinion, the relation of worth is a relation of identification.	justification	renown
the most worthy include the others because the latter identify with the former, as the fan identifies with the star.	justification	renown
but persons may also identify with objects that have been successful, and through these objects with the celebrities who have adopted and displayed them.	justification	renown
thus "every satisfied driver identifies with his car and \'defends\' it against judgments formulated by others".	justification	renown
to include others is to be recognized by others, to attract their attention, to convince them, to obtain respect from them, to earn or win their support.	justification	renown
a being of great fame creates a public, constitutes it as such, just as much as that being is created by its public.	justification	renown
the person that succeeds in breaking through, in capturing the attention of the public, includes and imparts reality to the being of those who, owing to the recognition that they grant that person, ensure his celebrity.	justification	renown
such a person "takes on the potential strength of each of his audiences" and manifests that strength by concentrating it in himself.	justification	renown
the term strength, although it is ambiguous, is used in the manual we are referring to here, as it is in hobbes\'s canonical texts, especially in the evocation of the way in which a famous person encompasses his public and increases in stature in proportion to its support.	justification	renown
the relation of inclusion among the worthy through their fame and their audience is expressed in terms of influence.	justification	renown
to establish a relation of influence, one has to hook, attract, alert, gain a following (fans) or a reputation, persuade, reach, sensitize, mobilize, interest, inform, seduce.	justification	renown
subjected to such influences, opinion creates fashion; it circulates the way a rumor does in a communications network, and thus imparts value to the beings of that nature whose fame spreads mutually from one to another: "if for example a company succeeds in inviting big names, stars, the reputation of those big names will carry over to the company itself".	justification	renown
being acquainted with something is equivalent to having heard of it: "by virtue of hearing of [someone or something] in any number of ways, the public has the impression, even if it is not involved in a consumer relationship, that it knows [that person or thing] .	justification	renown
talking about something, mentioning it, dropping a name, and publishing a book are all ways of "getting a message across," of releasing, spreading a piece of information.	justification	renown
in this world in which everything that has value is immediately known and visible, persons are constantly making comparisons.	justification	renown
thus, for example, "the press, in all its forms, allows employees of a company to compare their company, their own working conditions and salaries, to other companies in the same sector, or even in other sectors".	justification	renown
these crisscrossed comparisons weave a network.	justification	renown
persons who are receptive, receivers of the message, in tum become senders.	justification	renown
public relations offices are used to stimulate the process by creating "a network of free press agents".	justification	renown
in fact, those who have heard about something become its echoes, retransmit it, guaranteeing its repercussions; they convey information, they maintain the image, by multiplying and amplifying the message as a "center of resonance".	justification	renown
thus "it is extremely useful to sensitize members of the teaching profession, because of the power of amplification, that they represent".	justification	renown
similarly, "a good public relations policy may make it possible, for example, owing to good contacts with the press, to amplify \'good information.\'" "a public" thus plays "a dual role: spectator and actor.	justification	renown
the public is a spectator when it receives certain information that may prompt a reaction of endorsement, opposition, or indifference.	justification	renown
but then the public becomes an actor, for in most cases it will talk about that information to other publics to which it can communicate its opinion".	justification	renown
one can intervene in this communications network, manipulate it in order to plant an image, launch or promote a product "information emanating from the press, personalities, opinion leaders" "appears in the public eye" and, by orienting and manipulating the image transmitted to the public, it positions the product.	justification	renown
the natural order distributes the range of images by positioning them in relation to their publics, which are divided up into targets or audiences.	justification	renown
in the world of fame, the peak moments are those during which these images become salient, for example during a presentation that places them in the spotlight under the gaze of others.	justification	renown
beings achieve worth only if the presentation is made visible, in a transparent space in which it can be looked at and compared.	justification	renown
presentation "in the public eye," intended to give visibility to a being, for example by means of an "open house," is the object of a staging that makes it possible to manipulate the ambiance, the climate, the atmosphere, and the setting, which, during a demonstration, "must not simply be designed to dress up a room or an assembly line, but must contribute to creating an atmosphere in relation to the message that the company wants to transmit".	justification	renown
 the presentation may take the form of a press conference, "during which some important information is transmitted to journalists," or it may take the form of an inauguration or launching "that brings together big names, carefully chosen and important audiences, and journalists," and which makes it possible, while producing "as great a sensation as possible, ... to alert visitors and incite them to come in".	justification	renown
"a demonstration serves as a medium, from the vehicle to the message, obvious or implied, which makes it possible to achieve the desired goal.	justification	renown
consequently, the message may take on the form of a true message, it may communicate some information, or it may be only an ambiance, a climate that is created and that acts almost unconsciously on the audience present".	justification	renown
the brand name makes it possible to crystallize a trend in public opinion, through a brand image.	justification	renown
turning the press into an instrument ensures the objectification of this demonstration by its repercussions, the sensation that is produced: "the press is generally quick to echo the rumor and unconfirmed reports it picks up".	justification	renown
in the world of public opinion, judgment is in fact manifested by the convergence of opinions that produce a rumor, an unconfirmed report.	justification	renown
the demonstration is patent when this convergence is visible owing to the affluence of the world and can thus amplify itself on its own like a fashion: "it is well known that the world attracts the world and that the circus atmosphere (in the good sense) is always a safe bet".	justification	renown
the absence of judgment, in this world, consists in deluding oneself about one\'s own worth.	justification	renown
only a demonstration of the judgment of public opinion makes it possible to reduce the tension between the worth one attributes to oneself (ideal) and the worth that is attributed to one by others (real): "before undertaking any action at all on a brand image, it is important to know the real image (or the absence of a real image); to define with precision the ideal image that it would be desirable to promote".	justification	renown
to reduce a rumor or an unconfirmed report to its proper proportions, one must resort to the "reactions of public opinion".	justification	renown
the judgment may be supported, as we have already seen, by survey techniques that allow the establishment of a measure, a standing that helps reassure the celebrities of the undeniable worth that they are afforded by the recognition granted them.	justification	renown
indeed, in the world of public opinion, what is known is what is already obvious, and, conversely, what is either unknown to the majority (esoteric) or indistinguishable and lacking in relief is debatable.	justification	renown
to be unworthy, in the logic of public opinion, is to be banal (not to have been "debanalized"), "not to have any image at all, which in general signifies a complete ignorance of the product," or else to have an image that is fuzzy, degraded, faded, lost; to be forgotten or hidden, to encounter indifference or opposition, in short, to disappear": "certain companies struggle ... not to lose it [their image], not to disappear".	justification	renown
"all one has to do is keep a dose eye on the press for a month to be persuaded of this: events that mobilize public opinion in a country for several days running are completely forgotten from one day to the next because they have disappeared from the newspapers.	justification	renown
now, if a journalist does not return to the subject, it is because he judges that public opinion is no longer receptive, \'that it has already had enough,\' and that other information is more important". '	justification	renown
