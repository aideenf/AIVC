 in exploring the category of "green" justifications, we contribute fresh insight into the literature on environmental discourse or rhetoric, particularly the understanding of the different conceptions of wilderness and nature in the united states and france, and of the relations of humans (and human communities) and nature (dupuis and vandergeest 1996; spangle and knapp 1996; bennett and chaloupka 1994; killingsworth and palmer 1992).	justification	green
and our analysis adds an important comparative dimension missing from most previous work on environmental rhetoric by asking what differences might exist in the content or use of "green" arguments or images in these two countries, which have different environmental histories and movements.	justification	green
justifications based on "green ness" and environmentalism ["green" worth] many examples in previous sections refer to nature or the environment within an evaluation based on non environmental justifications and principles, e.g.	justification	green
when nature is marketed as a tourist attraction.	justification	green
other examples move to the next level: when environmental justifications, based on principles of what might be called "green ness" (as described below), are presented for their own sake or are combined with other sorts of justifications, e.g.	justification	green
when mitigations to infrastructure plans are proposed to make them more environmentally sensitive.46 these types of justifications which might add a new "order of worth" to the boltanski and th venot (1991) scheme (see latour 1995; lafaye and th venot 1993; barbier 1992) have become more refined and widespread since the rise of the global environmental movement in the past few decades, but they also have important historical and cultural precursors (oelschlaeger 1991; nash 1982; moscovici 1977; collingwood 1945).	justification	green
actions or entities are worthy, with regard to this "green" justification, when they support or reflect the principles of environmentalism or "green ness", e.g.	justification	green
clean/non polluting, renewable, recyclable, sustainable, and in harmony with nature.	justification	green
justifications based on environmentalism consider the general good of humanity to be advanced through a sensitivity to environmental issues and consequences, protection of wilderness, stewardship of environmental resources, and cultivation of various attachments to nature, the land, or the wild.	justification	green
strictly green arguments, beyond the level of integrating the environment into other sorts of non green justifications, posit a unique type of dependency which assumes more than simply a spatial interaction of humanity with the natural world, but also a temporal extension of humanity by way of an implicit or explicit reference to future generations (goodwin 1992; dobson 1990; larr re 1997; larr re and larr re 1997; naess and rothenberg 1989; taylor 1986).	justification	green
the green order of worth is revealed in distinctly "green" qualifications, such as the "health" of trout in the clavey river valued as something that is good for humanity, which are not considered relevant in any other order.	justification	green
at a further level, some environmental evaluations depart from the political and moral requirements which are shared by all orders of worth where common humanity is the group of reference for the evaluation and propose an extension of the "community" of reference to include non human entities (a move to "ecocentrism" rather than "anthropocentrism"; see, for example, eckersley 1996; devall and sessions 1985; stone 1974).	justification	green
the subsections which follow compare the expression and frequency of a number of green or environmental arguments found in the comparative survey, and explore the different modes of the relation of humans and the environment revealed by these arguments.	justification	green
unique and endangered perhaps the greatest similarity between the two cases is the extent and nature of arguments about the uniqueness or singularity of the natural places in dispute, and about the threat to "endangered species" (plant and animal) posed by the projects.	justification	green
in the clavey case, uniqueness arguments are perhaps the most prevalent environmental justifications offered by dam opponents.	justification	green
there are several senses in which the river is characterized as a unique natural place: in terms of being the "last" undammed river in the ecosystem, in terms of its specific role in local heritage and its historical importance, in terms of being a "rare" ecosystem not found elsewhere and in terms of the number of endangered species which live in the ecosystem.	justification	green
the environmentalists who opposed the dam on the clavey were constantly referring to a long list they compiled of all the "officially threatened or endangered" plant and animal species, such as the rare "wild trout," found within the clavey canyon and presumably further endangered by the project.48 the other side for their part constantly tried to refute this justification, either by denying the danger to these species or proposing to mitigate for any potential harm (but never explicitly by denying the importance of protecting endangered species).	justification	green
arguments in the somport controversy focus on the singularity of the aspe valley and the scarcity and uniqueness of the animals in the area.	justification	green
evaluations of the uniqueness of the valley are not so much concerned with it being the last wild place of a certain type, but rather concern the singularity of the entire "landscape" of the valley, including the animal and human inhabitants and the special integration between the people and land found there.	justification	green
the bears became a famous symbol of the project opposition they were described as the "last of their kind" and "endangered," and were considered deserving of protection because they had lived in the area for a long time (a somewhat different characterization to the legal sense of "endangered species" in the united states).	justification	green
the attachment to the pyrenean bear is understandable because it holds a special place of honor in this region it plays a central role in local customs such as carnivals, and it was a feared threat to humans, particularly farmers and shepherds, but also the prized prey of local bearhunting heroes.	justification	green
an exhibition on the bears in the valley town of accous tells the "fabulous story of a mythical animal".	justification	green
the use of the bear as a symbol attractive to the media has also been denounced by project supporters.	justification	green
in addition to the bears, other animals were put forward as endangered by the project, including a unique sort of amphibious mole.	justification	green
untouched wilderness in the clavey case, there are numerous arguments about keeping the clavey "free flowing," "untouched," "pristine," and "the way it was long before humans arrived".	justification	green
these claims became crucial points of contention and debate, and were given explicit consideration in the decision making by the government agencies involved e.g.	justification	green
the forest service rated the river partly on its value as an undisturbed habitat.	justification	green
dam proponent john mills spent much of his time attempting to disprove the claims that the clavey is "free flowing" and "untouched" for example, he argues there have been non wild, hatchery trout released into the river, and that there are small dams near the headwaters of the river.	justification	green
when used by environmentalists, however, these arguments generally mean "untouched by development" rather than untouched by man at all.	justification	green
while they are accused by mills and others of taking a "preservationist" or deep ecological stance that wilderness should be locked up and unused by any humans, many dam opponents making these "pristine" arguments are in fact fisherman, hunters, and rafters who enjoy "using" the "untouched" clavey.	justification	green
so these green arguments in the united states about pristine wilderness imply a view of the relation of humans and nature whereby humans can get great benefit from "participating in," "experiencing," or "struggling against" wilderness (or preserving untouched wilderness for others in the present or future to experience).	justification	green
so wilderness is valued (by dam opponents) because of its non human qualities, but the pristine quality of wilderness is used as a justification (against building the dam) because pristine wilderness has a benefit for humanity.	justification	green
in france, the notion of a "sublime" and "wild" nature is commonly found in the somport dispute, as in the clavey dispute.52 renaud provides a nice example of this view: "if you touch the aspe valley, if you want to make it more accessible, if you give it over to concrete and trucks, it would be a crime against beauty, an acid facelift of the noble visage of a distinguished old lady".	justification	green
however, the relation of man and the wild is not described in terms of a struggle so much as in the united states, and there is less attention to the "experience" of wilderness.	justification	green
in france the idea of "domesticated nature" is not necessarily set against "untouched wilderness" as in the united states53 while the clavey debate often concerns separating what is to be untouched and what is not, this is not always the case in the somport debate, and there are instead connections made between the domestic life of the valley and its natural life.	justification	green
for example, one reason offered against the road tunnel project was, "the survival of the large pyrenean scavenger birds depends on the perennial continuation of traditional practices such as mountain transhumance".	justification	green
the "wilderness industries" in the united states are more highly developed commercial enterprises than in france.	justification	green
these industries explicitly market a struggle of man against the wild and an escape from domestic life, and in the clavey dispute they are a primary source of the environmental arguments against the dam.	justification	green
in france, the tourist activities oriented toward nature were not, until recently, nearly as heavily equipped and are not geared toward a "struggle" of man against the wild, but rather a contemplation of the landscape by man.we can distinguish in the arguments made by wilderness industries between explicit green arguments wilderness experiences are good for people and the compromise of these arguments with market concerns, i.e.	justification	green
selling this experience to tourists.	justification	green
wild places as heritage and habitat in the earlier section dedicated to justifications based on tradition, we saw how evaluations of the projects based on "patrimoine" or "heritage" sometimes refer to "green" attachments to a place "inhabiting" a wild or natural place.	justification	green
the green characterization of "natural" heritage is particularly oriented toward future generations.	justification	green
in the clavey case, for example, dam opponents made the arguments that wild places like the clavey must be preserved because they have been entrusted to our stewardship by past generations and we must pass them on the future generations54.	justification	green
other times, these sorts of heritage arguments are also careful combinations of justifications based on tradition or locality ("domestic") and green justifications.	justification	green
for example, there are similar arguments in both cases about the value of being attached for a long time to a land that has been passed down through several generations of one s family, and these are then combined with arguments about the natural value of the land and the need to preserve it for the future.	justification	green
the clavey activist wally anker combines arguments in this way by saying first that the clavey is "the only place i know that is the same today as it was during the ice age," then saying that his family has lived near the clavey for generations, and he wants to preserve the clavey so his grandchildren can have the same attachment to it.	justification	green
animals can of course be included in these evaluations of wild places as part of our heritage, but animals have their own attachment to the wild place in terms of their "habitat," an attachment which environmentalism wants to preserve as part of "heritage".	justification	green
this raises the problem of arranging for "cohabitation" of humans and animals in making green arguments.	justification	green
this cohabitation problem is found in both cases, but is perhaps more central in france, where the connection between wild nature and domesticated nature has been built up over time.	justification	green
a voluntary association in the aspe valley, fiep, is in fact entirely dedicated to promoting harmonious "cohabitation," particularly by working to "let shepherds and bears live together in the pyrenees".	justification	green
fiep arranged for helicopter transportation of supplies to shepherds in their mountain outposts as a way to avoid building new roads that would threaten bear habitats, while still retaining the shepherds way of life.	justification	green
they promoted numerous mitigation measures such as wildlife road passages to allow for cohabitation.	justification	green
they emphasized the integration of valley habitats: "the bear is an integrator.	justification	green
we cannot take care of bears without taking care of the forest or the pastures, because the bears are demanding".	justification	green
the problem of cohabitation of humans and animals is also used in an ironic way by the prominent project supporter, jacques lassalle, who at one point states his goal as having "both genuinely wild bears and genuine humans".	justification	green
he contrasts wild bears with non wild bears put in zoos, and compares this to the contrast between genuine humans and non genuine humans who are forced by environmental restrictions to live in a "reservation of humans like a reservation of indians" in this way he uses cohabitation ironically as a defense of the project and at the same time denounces his opponent, the "indian" eric p tetin, who often identifies himself with the native indian ideal of living in harmony with the land.	justification	green
native "indian" attachments to sites p tetin s identification with the native american "indians" makes an ideal of the intimate connections of native indians to their culturally significant sites.	justification	green
p tetin often dresses up using some symbols of american indian costumes like a feather in his hair, and holds up indian culture as an exemplar of a sustainable and harmonious relationship with the land this attachment is then used as a green justification for his position against the somport project (although there is also a significant element of inspiration justification).	justification	green
p tetin says, "the indian culture is a culture shared by men and women who lived in harmony with nature all year around, without spoiling it, while using its richness, while loving it, while knowing it".	justification	green
p tetin s reference to the "indian" orientation to nature points to the important overlap between the native political and moral viewpoint, which emphasizes the integration and dependency of humans with non human entities, and the viewpoint of modern environmental politics which emphasizes this dependency also.	justification	green
in the clavey case, the involvement of the me wuk indian tribe in the controversy meant there was a more direct consideration of indian attachments to their land in this case.	justification	green
the tribal member most active in the clavey controversy is a grandmother named phyllis harness, who expressed her attachment to the clavey in many ways, including the fact that her grandson is named "clavey".	justification	green
one of her primary self descriptions is as a "gatherer" one who collects plants, particularly mushrooms, from the ancestral lands which surround the clavey and she often describes her gathering as a ritual, "sacred" cultural practice (something her elders taught her).	justification	green
the sacredness of her attachment to this place is in some ways "proved" only through being present in the place, and she prizes the experience of being near the clavey.	justification	green
this sort of presence is an intimate attachment to the natural place that phyllis compares to the connections of animals to specific locales or habitats: she compares the me wuk historical migrations through the clavey canyon with the migratory routes of a particular deer herd.	justification	green
the recognition of the power of this sort of native attachment to the clavey site as a general good (and so as a possible justification for or against the dam) was revealed in the rigorous competing attempts by both sides in the dispute to gain the endorsement of the me wuk tribe.	justification	green
the spokeswoman for the tribe originally endorsed the project (without an official tribal vote) after project supporters promised that the tribe could operate campgrounds on the dam s reservoir.	justification	green
when the rest of the tribe found out about this, however, harness and others vigorously objected and eventually passed a tribal resolution against the dam.	justification	green
thereafter the me wuk were often touted by the opposition campaign as key opponents of the project.	justification	green
the courting of the me wuk tribe s endorsement was clearly important both because of its political appeal (politicians are known to be sensitive to "native" issues), and because their attachment to the land makes them the most legitimate "spokespersons for the land".	justification	green
deep ecology a particular variant of "green" standards of evaluation known as "deep ecology" has been developed, primarily in the united states but initially in europe (naess and rothenberg 1989; devall and sessions 1985; lovelock 1979), which makes a very important move away from the common moral requirements found in the other types of justification we have been considering.	justification	green
the justifications environmental or other types discussed so far refer to the good of humanity as the primary basis for assigning value: the goal is "good for everyone".	justification	green
but in the deep ecology philosophy and movement, the community of "everyone" that is the basis for evaluations is extended beyond the human community to include the good of non human natural entities (e.g.	justification	green
trees, animals); they refer to this as a shift from "anthropocentrism" to "ecocentrism".	justification	green
green arguments based on a deep ecology perspective value a healthy environment or the preservation of species not because of their benefits for humanity, but for their own sake, for the benefit of the integrated ecosystem (which includes humans) itself.	justification	green
deep ecology arguments are explicitly made only rarely in the clavey case; they are never made seriously in the somport case, but there are a couple instances when they are used sarcastically.	justification	green
one example from the clavey case is a statement made by the rafting company owner with a deeply personal connection to the river, marty mcdonnell.	justification	green
in talking about reasons to preserve the river, he discounts the human definition of a clean environment and privileges the animal s concerns in determining what s really important: "throwing a beer can out the window doesn t really harm the health [of the environment].	justification	green
it may look bad, but i m sure that the deer that walks by could care less if he sees a beer can on the side of the road or not.	justification	green
it offends my sense of natural order, but that s just a human thing".	justification	green
in the somport case, there are a couple of instances where deep ecological arguments are used sarcastically, mocking the radical environmental notion that the good of animals on their own should be the criteria of worth or evaluation.	justification	green
one instance of this is a letter to the editor of an important paper in the pyrenees region which is in fact a parody of efforts to protect the bears.	justification	green
the author mentions all the money to be spent on somport mitigation measures such as bear ducts and bridges, and he proposes to spend as much money to protect a species of glow worm from devastation by the road and tunnel.	justification	green
he ironically praises the efforts of americans to save species in peril (stranded whales rescued by an icebreaker), by suggesting the construction of an underground tunnel for the worms to avoid the road is a similar but more modest effort of a less wealthy country.	justification	green
this parody is partly also a denunciation of the influence of "radical" american environmentalist views in the somport controversy. '	justification	green
