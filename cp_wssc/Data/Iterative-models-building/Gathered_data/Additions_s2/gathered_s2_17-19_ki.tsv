We address the task of recognizing the category of an ongoing human action from a video stream.	Semantic Scholar
This task is challenging because of the need to output categorization decisions based on partial evidence—the action has not finished and not all information about the action has been observed.	Semantic Scholar
This task is further complicated because the ongoing action is submerged in the stream of data and the start of the action is not given.	Semantic Scholar
Existing methods for early recognition usually ignore this issue, making unrealistic assumption about the availability of the starting point of the ongoing action.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we prove the importance of starting point detection and subsequently propose a method to determine the start of an ongoing action.	Semantic Scholar
Our method is based on a bidirectional recurrent neural network that computes the probability of a frame to be the starting point by comparing the dynamics of the actions before and after the frame.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on three datasets show that our method can reliably detect the starting point of an ongoing action, improving the early recognition accuracy.	Semantic Scholar

Navigation systems have been widely used in outdoor environments, but indoor navigation systems are still in early development stages.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we introduced an augmented-reality-based indoor navigation application to assist people navigate in indoor environments.	Semantic Scholar
The application can be implemented on electronic devices such as a smartphone or a head-mounted device.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we examined Google Glass as a wearable head-mounted device in comparison with handheld navigation aids including a smartphone and a paper map.	Semantic Scholar
We conducted both a technical assessment study and a human factors study.	Semantic Scholar
The technical assessment established the feasibility and reliability of the system.	Semantic Scholar
The human factors study evaluated human-machine system performance measures including perceived accuracy, navigation time, subjective comfort, subjective workload, and route memory retention.	Semantic Scholar
The results showed that the wearable device was perceived to be more accurate, but other performance and workload results indicated that the wearable device was not significantly different from the handheld smartphone.	Semantic Scholar
We also found that both digital navigation aids were better than the paper map in terms of shorter navigation time and lower workload, but digital navigation aids resulted in worse route retention.	Semantic Scholar
These results could provide empirical evidence supporting future designs of indoor navigation systems.	Semantic Scholar
Implications and future research were also discussed.	Semantic Scholar
Motion cueing algorithms are used in motion simulation to map the inertial vehicle motion onto the limited simulator motion space.	Semantic Scholar
This mapping causes mismatches between the unrestricted visual motion and the constrained inertial motion, which results in perceived motion incongruence (PMI).	Semantic Scholar
It is still largely unknown what exactly causes visual and inertial motion in a simulator to be perceived as incongruent.	Semantic Scholar
Current methods for measuring motion incongruence during motion simulation result in time-invariant measures of the overall incongruence, which makes it difficult to determine the relevance of the individual and short-duration mismatches between visual and inertial motion cues.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a novel method is presented to subjectively measure the time-varying PMI continuously throughout a simulation.	Semantic Scholar
The method is analyzed for reliability and validity of its measurements, as well as for its applicability in relating physical short-duration cueing errors to PMI.	Semantic Scholar
The analysis shows that the method is reliable and that the results can be used to obtain a deeper insight into the formation of motion incongruence during driving simulation.	Semantic Scholar
The external aspects of a robot affect how people behave and perceive it while interacting.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study the importance of the mouth displayed by a social robot and explore how different designs of an artificial LED-based mouths alter the participants’ judgments of a robot's attributes and their attention to the robot's message.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluated participants’ judgments of a speaking robot under four conditions: 1) without a mouth; 2) with a static smile; 3) with a vibrating, wave-shaped mouth; and 4) with a moving, human-like mouth.	Semantic Scholar
A total of 79 participants evaluated their perceptions of an on-video robot showing one of the four conditions.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that the presence of a mouth, as well as its design, alters the perception of the robot.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the presence of a mouth makes the robot to be perceived more lifelike and less sad.	Semantic Scholar
The human-like mouth was the one participants liked the most and, along with the smile, they were the friendliest ones.	Semantic Scholar
On the contrary, participants rated the mouthless robot and the one with the wave-like mouth as the most dangerous ones.	Semantic Scholar

Free floating autonomous underwater manipulation is still an open research topic; an important challenge is offered by free floating manipulation, where the vehicle maintains relevant velocities during manipulation tasks.	Semantic Scholar
This paper focuses on the modelling and the control of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle for Intervention (I-AUV).	Semantic Scholar
To this aim, an accurate model of the I-AUV has been implemented, including the interaction with the fluid.	Semantic Scholar
Then, a control architecture for the whole system is proposed, with particular attention on a suitable grasp planning strategy.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, a free floating manipulation task has been simulated to analyse in details the performances of the I-AUV control system.	Semantic Scholar
This paper suggests a novel method for a mobile robot to plan its path towards a target through an unknown environment, using sensors to discover new obstacles along the way.	Semantic Scholar
The method synthesizes an artificial temperature gradient throughout the known environment by numerically solving the heat conduction partial differential equation, where obstacles encountered during the robot navigation are “hot” and the target is “cold.” The temperature at all other points on the known environment grid are computed numerically, and are continuously updated to account for new obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
This method ensures the creation of navigational potential field with no danger of being trapped in local minima.	Semantic Scholar
A computer simulation demonstrates the technique on several environment types.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, an experiment was conducted on a mobile robot that can navigate indoors and outdoors in real time using this method.	Semantic Scholar
The simulations and experiment show that the temperature gradient method is robust in its ability to find paths, and is practical for online sensor based navigation of mobile robots.	Semantic Scholar
Road traffic speed prediction is a challenging problem in intelligent transportation system (ITS) and has gained increasing attentions.	Semantic Scholar
Existing works are mainly based on raw speed sensing data obtained from infrastructure sensors or probe vehicles, which, however, are limited by expensive cost of sensor deployment and maintenance.	Semantic Scholar
With sparse speed observations, traditional methods based only on speed sensing data are insufficient, especially when emergencies like traffic accidents occur.	Semantic Scholar
To address the issue, this paper aims to improve the road traffic speed prediction by fusing traditional speed sensing data with new-type “sensing” data from cross domain sources, such as tweet sensors from social media and trajectory sensors from map and traffic service platforms.	Semantic Scholar
Jointly modeling information from different datasets brings many challenges, including location uncertainty of low-resolution data, language ambiguity of traffic description in texts, and heterogeneity of cross-domain data.	Semantic Scholar
In response to these challenges, we present a unified probabilistic framework, called Topic-Enhanced Gaussian Process Aggregation Model (TEGPAM), consisting of three components, i.e., location disaggregation model, traffic topic model, and traffic speed Gaussian Process model, which integrate new-type data with traditional data.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on real world data from two large cities validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our model.	Semantic Scholar

Microelectrode arrays serve as an indispensable tool in electro-physiological research to study the electrical activity of neural cells, enabling measurements of single cell as well as network communication analysis.	Semantic Scholar
Recent experimental studies have reported that the neuronal geometry has an influence on electrical signaling and extracellular recordings.	Semantic Scholar
However, the corresponding mechanisms are not yet fully understood and require further investigation.	Semantic Scholar
Allowing systematic parameter studies, computational modeling provides the opportunity to examine the underlying effects that influence extracellular potentials.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present an in silico single cell model to analyze the effect of geometrical variability on the extracellular electric potentials.	Semantic Scholar
We describe finite element models of a single neuron with varying geometric complexity in three-dimensional space.	Semantic Scholar
The electric potential generation of the neuron is modeled using Hodgkin-Huxley equations.	Semantic Scholar
The signal propagation is described with electro-quasi-static equations, and results are compared with corresponding cable equation descriptions.	Semantic Scholar
Our results show that both the geometric dimensions and the distribution of ion channels of a neuron are critical factors that significantly influence both the amplitude and shape of extracellular potentials.	Semantic Scholar

Graph is an important data representation which appears in a wide diversity of real-world scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
Effective graph analytics provides users a deeper understanding of what is behind the data, and thus can benefit a lot of useful applications such as node classification, node recommendation, link prediction, etc.	Semantic Scholar
However, most graph analytics methods suffer the high computation and space cost.	Semantic Scholar
Graph embedding is an effective yet efficient way to solve the graph analytics problem.	Semantic Scholar
It converts the graph data into a low dimensional space in which the graph structural information and graph properties are maximumly preserved.	Semantic Scholar
In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature in graph embedding.	Semantic Scholar
We first introduce the formal definition of graph embedding as well as the related concepts.	Semantic Scholar
After that, we propose two taxonomies of graph embedding which correspond to what challenges exist in different graph embedding problem settings and how the existing work addresses these challenges in their solutions.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we summarize the applications that graph embedding enables and suggest four promising future research directions in terms of computation efficiency, problem settings, techniques, and application scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
GPUs have been increasingly used to accelerate graph processing for complicated computational problems regarding graph theory.	Semantic Scholar
Many parallel graph algorithms adopt the asynchronous computing model to accelerate the iterative convergence.	Semantic Scholar
Unfortunately, the consistent asynchronous computing requires locking or atomic operations, leading to significant penalties/overheads when implemented on GPUs.	Semantic Scholar
As such, the coloring algorithm is adopted to separate the vertices with potential updating conflicts, guaranteeing the consistency/correctness of the parallel processing.	Semantic Scholar
Common coloring algorithms, however, may suffer from low parallelism because of a large number of colors generally required for processing a large-scale graph with billions of vertices.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a light-weight asynchronous processing framework called Frog with a preprocessing/hybrid coloring model.	Semantic Scholar
The fundamental idea is based on the Pareto principle (or 80-20 rule) about coloring algorithms as we observed through masses of real-world graph coloring cases.	Semantic Scholar
We find that a majority of vertices (about 80 percent) are colored with only a few colors, such that they can be read and updated in a very high degree of parallelism without violating the sequential consistency.	Semantic Scholar
Accordingly, our solution separates the processing of the vertices based on the distribution of colors.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we mainly answer three questions: (1) how to partition the vertices in a sparse graph with maximized parallelism, (2) how to process large-scale graphs that cannot fit into GPU memory, and (3) how to reduce the overhead of data transfers on PCIe while processing each partition.	Semantic Scholar
We conduct experiments on real-world data (Amazon, DBLP, YouTube, RoadNet-CA, WikiTalk, and Twitter) to evaluate our approach and make comparisons with well-known non-preprocessed (such as Totem, Medusa, MapGraph, and Gunrock) and preprocessed (Cusha) approaches, by testing four classical algorithms (BFS, PageRank, SSSP, and CC).	Semantic Scholar
On all the tested applications and datasets, Frog is able to significantly outperform existing GPU-based graph processing systems except Gunrock and MapGraph.	Semantic Scholar
MapGraph gets better performance than Frog when running BFS on RoadNet-CA.	Semantic Scholar
The comparison between Gunrock and Frog is inconclusive.	Semantic Scholar
Frog can outperform Gunrock more than 1.04X when running PageRank and SSSP, while the advantage of Frog is not obvious when running BFS and CC on some datasets especially for RoadNet-CA.	Semantic Scholar
This paper depicts the structural design of a novel water-jet-based spherical underwater robot.	Semantic Scholar
The propulsion system is made up of four water-jet thrusters and 8 steering servo motors which can adjust the polydirectional shift of thrusters nozzle to achieve 4-degrees-of-freedom (4-DOF) motion.	Semantic Scholar
Every two thrusters nozzles formed an angle of 90 degree in one plane.	Semantic Scholar
A bilayer structure was adopted for the control system to obtain data from various sensors, meanwhile control the outputs of ports after calculation processing.	Semantic Scholar
The primary side whose core is TMS320f28335 processor was employed for the data collection and disposing calculation.	Semantic Scholar
And made the Atmega2560 processor as the main chip of the subordinate side to control the propulsion system.	Semantic Scholar
The Micron Data Modem is integrated into the electrical design, which can realize the data transmission and communication between multi-SURs in future.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the theoretical analysis and calculation, a series of underwater experiments were carried out to test the performance of the novel spherical underwater robot; these experiments included surgesway motion test, yaw motion test, heave motion test, and anti-interference test.	Semantic Scholar
A FSMC controller was employed to control the direction of the vectored water-jet thrusters for underwater motion.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results demonstrated that the novel spherical underwater robot could realize underwater motion rapidly and accurately.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of the novel SUR is more nimbler and flexible than the previous SUR-II we developed.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we analyze the role of hidden bias in representational efficiency of the Gaussian-Bipolar Restricted Boltzmann Machines (GBPRBMs), which are similar to the widely used Gaussian-Bernoulli RBMs.	Semantic Scholar
Our experiments show that hidden bias plays an important role in shaping of the probability density function of the visible units.	Semantic Scholar
We define hidden entropy and propose it as a measure of representational efficiency of the model.	Semantic Scholar
By using this measure, we investigate the effect of hidden bias on the hidden entropy and provide a full analysis of the hidden entropy as function of the hidden bias for small models with up to three hidden units.	Semantic Scholar
We also provide an insight into understanding of the representational efficiency of the larger scale models.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we introduce Normalized Empirical Hidden Entropy (NEHE) as an alternative to hidden entropy that can be computed for large models.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and Faces data sets show that NEHE can serve as measure of representational efficiency and gives an insight on minimum number of hidden units required to represent the data.	Semantic Scholar
The correlation method from brain imaging has been used to estimate functional connectivity in the human brain.	Semantic Scholar
However, brain regions might show very high correlation even when the two regions are not directly connected due to the strong interaction of the two regions with common input from a third region.	Semantic Scholar
One previously proposed solution to this problem is to use a sparse regularized inverse covariance matrix or precision matrix (SRPM) assuming that the connectivity structure is sparse.	Semantic Scholar
This method yields partial correlations to measure strong direct interactions between pairs of regions while simultaneously removing the influence of the rest of the regions, thus identifying regions that are conditionally independent.	Semantic Scholar
To test our methods, we first demonstrated conditions under which the SRPM method could indeed find the true physical connection between a pair of nodes for a spring-mass example and an RC circuit example.	Semantic Scholar
The recovery of the connectivity structure using the SRPM method can be explained by energy models using the Boltzmann distribution.	Semantic Scholar
We then demonstrated the application of the SRPM method for estimating brain connectivity during stage 2 sleep spindles from human electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings using an electrode array.	Semantic Scholar
The ECoG recordings that we analyzed were from a 32-year-old male patient with long-standing pharmaco-resistant left temporal lobe complex partial epilepsy.	Semantic Scholar
Sleep spindles were automatically detected using delay differential analysis and then analyzed with SRPM and the Louvain method for community detection.	Semantic Scholar
We found spatially localized brain networks within and between neighboring cortical areas during spindles, in contrast to the case when sleep spindles were not present.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we consider the problem of rendering robotic tasks persistent by ensuring that the robots’ energy levels are never depleted, which means that the tasks can be executed over long time horizons.	Semantic Scholar
This process is referred to as the persistification of the task.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the state of each robot is augmented with its battery level so that the desired persistent behavior can be encoded as the forward invariance of a set such that the robots never deplete their batteries.	Semantic Scholar
Control barrier functions are employed to synthesize controllers that ensure that this set is forward invariant and, therefore, that the robotic task is persistent.	Semantic Scholar
As an application, this letter considers the persistification of a robotic sensor coverage task in which a group of robots has to cover an area of interest.	Semantic Scholar
The successful persistification of the coverage task is shown in simulation and on a team of mobile robots.	Semantic Scholar
Typically, localization algorithms focus on maximizing estimation accuracy, often while neglecting some of the real-world costs of achieving such performance.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we formulate <italic>optimal scheduling problems </italic> of multirobot localization to investigate the tradeoff between estimate accuracy and its corresponding cost.	Semantic Scholar
We derive the continuous-time approximation to explicitly represent the rates of distinct operations in a multirobot localization scheme, which we then use to define the optimization problems for scheduling those operations.	Semantic Scholar
For a given accuracy requirement, we can solve the <italic>cost minimization problem</italic> to find the lowest cost schedule satisfying the prescribed error expectation; similarly, for a given cost budget, we can solve the <italic> trace minimization problem</italic> to find a schedule for the best achievable error performance.	Semantic Scholar
While the interplay between the localization error and the operation parameters is described by a Riccati equation, the Fréchet derivative is applied to shed the light on their implicit relationship.	Semantic Scholar
"In a localization example grounded in a realistic setting, we show that by solving these optimal scheduling problems, power consumption can be reduced by <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$64\%$</tex-math></inline-formula> through cost minimization, or the bounding covariance trace can be reduced by <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$15\%$</tex-math> </inline-formula> through trace minimization."

Active sensing provides a way to assess whether a thin film of gecko-inspired adhesive has made good contact with a surface.	Semantic Scholar
This knowledge is useful for applications like gripping objects in space where a failed grasp could lead to loss of the object.	Semantic Scholar
Our active sensing approach uses Lamb waves in thin bilayers, excited, and detected by piezoelectric strips.	Semantic Scholar
From the theory, we describe how attenuation increases with contact boundary condition changes.	Semantic Scholar
We validated the theory using frustrated total internal reflection imaging, showing that attenuation increases as the contact area grows.	Semantic Scholar
"Pull tests on different textures of acrylic plate show that the slope change of the signal can predict the maximum adhesion limit with a 10 N window and predict impending failure with a detection rate <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$>$</tex-math></inline-formula>80%."

"Lifting a cylindrical object shows that the sensor can signal different types of failures with a detection rate <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$>$</tex-math></inline-formula>85%, associated with unstable grasping."	Semantic Scholar
Superpixels group perceptually similar pixels to create visually meaningful entities while heavily reducing the number of primitives for subsequent processing steps.	Semantic Scholar
As of these properties, superpixel algorithms have received much attention since their naming in 2003 [1].	Semantic Scholar
By today, publicly available superpixel algorithms have turned into standard tools in low-level vision.	Semantic Scholar
As such, and due to their quick adoption in a wide range of applications, appropriate benchmarks are crucial for algorithm selection and comparison.	Semantic Scholar
Until now, the rapidly growing number of algorithms as well as varying experimental setups hindered the development of a unifying benchmark.	Semantic Scholar
We present a comprehensive evaluation of 28 state-of-the-art superpixel algorithms utilizing a benchmark focussing on fair comparison and designed to provide new insights relevant for applications.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we explicitly discuss parameter optimization and the importance of strictly enforcing connectivity.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, by extending well-known metrics, we are able to summarize algorithm performance independent of the number of generated superpixels, thereby overcoming a major limitation of available benchmarks.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we discuss runtime, robustness against noise, blur and affine transformations, implementation details as well as aspects of visual quality.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we present an overall ranking of superpixel algorithms which redefines the stateof-the-art and enables researchers to easily select appropriate algorithms and the corresponding implementations which themselves are made publicly available as part of our benchmark at davidstutz.de/projects/superpixel-benchmark/.	Semantic Scholar
With our ability to record more neurons simultaneously, making sense of these data is a challenge.	Semantic Scholar
Functional connectivity is one popular way to study the relationship of multiple neural signals.	Semantic Scholar
Correlation-based methods are a set of currently well-used techniques for functional connectivity estimation.	Semantic Scholar
However, due to explaining away and unobserved common inputs (Stevenson, Rebesco, Miller, & Körding, 2008), they produce spurious connections.	Semantic Scholar
The general linear model (GLM), which models spike trains as Poisson processes (Okatan, Wilson, & Brown, 2005; Truccolo, Eden, Fellows, Donoghue, & Brown, 2005; Pillow et al., 2008), avoids these confounds.	Semantic Scholar
We develop here a new class of methods by using differential signals based on simulated intracellular voltage recordings.	Semantic Scholar
It is equivalent to a regularized AR(2) model.	Semantic Scholar
We also expand the method to simulated local field potential recordings and calcium imaging.	Semantic Scholar
In all of our simulated data, the differential covariance-based methods achieved performance better than or similar to the GLM method and required fewer data samples.	Semantic Scholar
This new class of methods provides alternative ways to analyze neural signals.	Semantic Scholar
The estimation of covariance matrices is of prime importance to analyze the distribution of multivariate signals.	Semantic Scholar
In motor imagery–based brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCI), covariance matrices play a central role in the extraction of features from recorded electroencephalograms (EEGs); therefore, correctly estimating covariance is crucial for EEG classification.	Semantic Scholar
This letter discusses algorithms to average sample covariance matrices (SCMs) for the selection of the reference matrix in tangent space mapping (TSM)–based MI-BCI.	Semantic Scholar
Tangent space mapping is a powerful method of feature extraction and strongly depends on the selection of a reference covariance matrix.	Semantic Scholar
In general, the observed signals may include outliers; therefore, taking the geometric mean of SCMs as the reference matrix may not be the best choice.	Semantic Scholar
In order to deal with the effects of outliers, robust estimators have to be used.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we discuss and test the use of geometric medians and trimmed averages (defined on the basis of several metrics) as robust estimators.	Semantic Scholar
The main idea behind trimmed averages is to eliminate data that exhibit the largest distance from the average covariance calculated on the basis of all available data.	Semantic Scholar
The results of the experiments show that while the geometric medians show little differences from conventional methods in terms of classification accuracy in the classification of electroencephalographic recordings, the trimmed averages show significant improvement for all subjects.	Semantic Scholar
In the era of “big data”, one of the key challenges is to analyze large amounts of data collected in meaningful and scalable ways.	Semantic Scholar
The field of process mining is concerned with the analysis of data that is of a particular nature, namely data that results from the execution of business processes.	Semantic Scholar
The analysis of such data can be negatively influenced by the presence of outliers, which reflect infrequent behavior or “noise”.	Semantic Scholar
In process discovery, where the objective is to automatically extract a process model from the data, this may result in rarely travelled pathways that clutter the process model.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents an automated technique to the removal of infrequent behavior from event logs.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed technique is evaluated in detail and it is shown that its application in conjunction with certain existing process discovery algorithms significantly improves the quality of the discovered process models and that it scales well to large datasets.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a new approach to online synchronization of a robot to the motion of an object.	Semantic Scholar
This is done by an iterative trajectory planning approach.	Semantic Scholar
Trajectory planning is divided into geometric path planning and subsequent time optimal parameterization of the geometric path.	Semantic Scholar
The geometric path planning approach can handle position constraints in joint space as well as in task space and results in a sequential quadratic program in two variables for each joint.	Semantic Scholar
The time optimal path parameterization respecting joint velocity, acceleration, and jerk constraints is formulated as a linear program.	Semantic Scholar
However, the overall optimization problem is nonlinear.	Semantic Scholar
Only few iterations of this nonlinear optimization problem can be performed online.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, a method for obtaining a time scaling function is presented such that the robot and the object are synchronized exactly.	Semantic Scholar
The synchronization task is executed online and experimental results are shown for a 6-DOF manipulator.	Semantic Scholar
Within the field of image and video recognition, the traditional approach is a dataset split into fixed training and test partitions.	Semantic Scholar
However, the labelling of the training set is time-consuming, especially as datasets grow in size and complexity.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, this approach is not applicable to the home user, who wants to intuitively group their media without tirelessly labelling the content.	Semantic Scholar
Consequently, we propose a solution similar in nature to an active learning paradigm, where a small subset of media is labelled as semantically belonging to the same class, and machine learning is then used to pull this and other related content together in the feature space.	Semantic Scholar
Our interactive approach is able to iteratively cluster classes of images and video.	Semantic Scholar
We reformulate it in an online learning framework and demonstrate competitive performance to batch learning approaches using only a fraction of the labelled data.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach is based around the concept of an image signature which, unlike a standard bag of words model, can express co-occurrence statistics as well as symbol frequency.	Semantic Scholar
We efficiently compute metric distances between signatures despite their inherent high dimensionality and provide discriminative feature selection, to allow common and distinctive elements to be identified from a small set of user labelled examples.	Semantic Scholar
These elements are then accentuated in the image signature to increase similarity between examples and pull correct classes together.	Semantic Scholar
By repeating this process in an online learning framework, the accuracy of similarity increases dramatically despite labelling only a few training examples.	Semantic Scholar
To demonstrate that the approach is agnostic to media type and features used, we evaluate on three image datasets (15 scene, Caltech101 and FG-NET), a mixed text and image dataset (ImageTag), a dataset used in active learning (Iris) and on three action recognition datasets (UCF11, KTH and Hollywood2).	Semantic Scholar
On the UCF11 video dataset, the accuracy is 86.7% despite using only 90 labelled examples from a dataset of over 1200 videos, instead of the standard 1122 training videos.	Semantic Scholar
The approach is both scalable and efficient, with a single iteration over the full UCF11 dataset of around 1200 videos taking approximately 1 minute on a standard desktop machine.	Semantic Scholar

The contribution of this work is to show that real-time nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) can be implemented on position controlled humanoid robots.	Semantic Scholar
Following the idea of “walking without thinking,” we propose a walking pattern generator that takes into account simultaneously the position and orientation of the feet.	Semantic Scholar
A requirement for an application in real-world scenarios is the avoidance of obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, this letter shows an extension of the pattern generator that directly considers the avoidance of convex obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm uses the whole-body dynamics to correct the center of mass trajectory of the underlying simplified model.	Semantic Scholar
The pattern generator runs in real-time on the embedded hardware of the humanoid robot HRP2 and experiments demonstrate the increase in performance with the correction.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a nonlinear inverse kinematics formulation which solves for positions directly.	Semantic Scholar
Compared to various other popular methods that integrate velocities, this formulation can better handle fast, asymmetric, and singular-postured balancing tasks for humanoid robots.	Semantic Scholar
We also introduce joint position and velocity boundaries as inequality constraints in the optimization to ensure feasibility.	Semantic Scholar
Such boundaries provide safety when approaching or getting away from joint limits or singularities.	Semantic Scholar
Besides, mixing positions and velocities in our proposed algorithm facilitates recovery from singularities, which is very difficult for conventional inverse kinematics methods.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive demonstrations on the real robot prove the applicability of the proposed algorithm while improving power consumption.	Semantic Scholar
Our formulation automatically handles different numerical and behavioral difficulties rising from singularities, which makes it a reliable low-level conversion block for different Cartesian planners.	Semantic Scholar

Generating ground truth to design object detectors for large geographic areas covered by hundreds of satellite images poses two major challenges: one algorithmic and the other rooted in human–computer interaction considerations.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithmic challenge relates to minimizing the human annotation burden by collecting only those ground truth samples that are likely to improve the classifier.	Semantic Scholar
And the human–computer interaction challenge relates to the temporal latencies associated with scanning all the images to find those ground truth samples and eliciting annotations from a user.	Semantic Scholar
We address the algorithmic challenge by using the now wellknown concepts from Active Learning, albeit with a significant departure from how Active Learning has traditionally been presented in the literature: we present a human-operated active learning framework, rather than relying on previously collected fully labeled datasets for simulated experiments.	Semantic Scholar
And, we address the humancomputer interaction challenge by using a distributed approach that relies on multiple virtual machines working in parallel to carry out randomized scans in different portions of the geographic area in order to generate the active-learning based samples for human annotation.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate our wide-area framework for two infrequently occurring objects over large geographic areas in Australia.	Semantic Scholar
One is for detecting pedestrian crosswalks in a region that spans 180,000 sq.	Semantic Scholar
km, and the other is for detecting power transmission-line towers in a region that spans 150,000 sq.	Semantic Scholar
km.	Semantic Scholar
Using randomly selected unseen regions for measuring detector performance, the crosswalk detector works with 92% precision and 72% recall, and the transmission-line tower detector with 80% precision and 50% recall.	Semantic Scholar
Movement prioritization is a common approach to combine controllers of different tasks for redundant robots, where each task is assigned a priority.	Semantic Scholar
The priorities of the tasks are often handtuned or the result of an optimization, but seldomly learned from data.	Semantic Scholar
This letter combines Bayesian task prioritization with probabilistic movement primitives (ProMPs) to prioritize full motion sequences that are learned from demonstrations.	Semantic Scholar
ProMPs can encode distributions of movements over full motion sequences and provide control laws to exactly follow these distributions.	Semantic Scholar
The probabilistic formulation allows for a natural application of Bayesian task prioritization.	Semantic Scholar
We extend the ProMP controllers with an additional feedback component that accounts inaccuracies in following the distribution and allows for a more robust prioritization of primitives.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate how the task priorities can be obtained from imitation learning and how different primitives can be combined to solve even unseen task-combinations.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the prioritization, our approach can efficiently learn a combination of tasks without requiring individual models per task combination.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, our approach can adapt an existing primitive library by prioritizing additional controllers, for example, for implementing obstacle avoidance.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, the need of retraining the whole library is avoided in many cases.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our approach on reaching movements under constraints with redundant simulated planar robots and two physical robot platforms, the humanoid robot “iCub” and a KUKA LWR robot arm.	Semantic Scholar
The motion behavior of a skid-steering rover on loose terrain is modeled experimentally, and a position estimation method based on the model is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
Skid steering is a steering method adopted for various vehicles and robots.	Semantic Scholar
In this method, the vehicles steer by controlling a ratio between the rotational velocities of their left and right wheels.	Semantic Scholar
For controlling a skid-steering rover, whose wheels can slip on the lunar and planetary surfaces, which are covered with loose regolith, it is important to model accurately the rover's motion behaviors on loose terrain.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we conducted traveling tests using a four-wheeled rover in a sand field and analyzed the motion behaviors of the rover on loose terrain.	Semantic Scholar
In the tests, the velocities of the rover's left and right wheels were controlled, and the rover traveled with various turning patterns.	Semantic Scholar
From the test datasets, we derived a mathematical model that expresses a relationship between the input and output velocities of the rover's wheels.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the effectiveness of a position and motion estimation method based on the model was confirmed from experiments conducted in the sand field.	Semantic Scholar
Fitting facial landmarks on unconstrained videos is a challenging task with broad applications.	Semantic Scholar
Both generic and joint alignment methods have been proposed with varying degrees of success.	Semantic Scholar
However, many generic methods are heavily sensitive to initializations and usually rely on offline-trained static models, which limit their performance on sequential images with extensive variations.	Semantic Scholar
On the other hand, joint methods are restricted to offline applications, since they require all frames to conduct batch alignment.	Semantic Scholar
To address these limitations, we propose to exploit incremental learning for personalized ensemble alignment.	Semantic Scholar
We sample multiple initial shapes to achieve image congealing within one frame, which enables us to incrementally conduct ensemble alignment by group-sparse regularized rank minimization.	Semantic Scholar
At the same time, incremental subspace adaptation is performed to achieve personalized modeling in a unified framework.	Semantic Scholar
To alleviate the drifting issue, we leverage a very efficient fitting evaluation network to pick out well-aligned faces for robust incremental learning.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on both controlled and unconstrained datasets have validated our approach in different aspects and demonstrated its superior performance compared with state of the arts in terms of fitting accuracy and efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
The computational principles of slowness and predictability have been proposed to describe aspects of information processing in the visual system.	Semantic Scholar
From the perspective of slowness being a limited special case of predictability we investigate the relationship between these two principles empirically.	Semantic Scholar
On a collection of real-world data sets we compare the features extracted by slow feature analysis (SFA) to the features of three recently proposed methods for predictable feature extraction: forecastable component analysis, predictable feature analysis, and graph-based predictable feature analysis.	Semantic Scholar
Our experiments show that the predictability of the learned features is highly correlated, and, thus, SFA appears to effectively implement a method for extracting predictable features according to different measures of predictability.	Semantic Scholar
Planetary rovers exploring the surface of Mars rely on vision-based localization and navigation algorithms to estimate their state and plan their motion during autonomous traverses.	Semantic Scholar
The accurate estimation of rover's motion enables safe navigation across environments with potentially hazardous terrain that would otherwise require careful human intervention.	Semantic Scholar
The accuracy of these vision-based localization and navigation methods are directly related to the amount of visual texture observed by the rover's sensors.	Semantic Scholar
This poses a challenge for Mars navigation, where texture-limited surfaces such as smooth sand is prevalent.	Semantic Scholar
To overcome this issue, we propose making use of a rover's ability to actively steer its visual sensors with the goal of maximizing actionable visual information content.	Semantic Scholar
This letter answers the question of where and when to look by presenting a method to predict the sensor trajectory that maximizes rover localization performance.	Semantic Scholar
This is accomplished through an online search of possible trajectories using synthetic, future camera views created from observed data.	Semantic Scholar
Proposed trajectories are quantified and chosen based on expected localization performance.	Semantic Scholar
We validate our algorithm in a high-fidelity simulation of a Mars-analogue environment and show how intelligently choosing where to look during a traverse can increase navigation accuracy compared to traditional fixed-sensor configurations.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we aim to tackle the neural robust tracking control problem for a class of nonlinear systems using the adaptive critic technique.	Semantic Scholar
The main contribution is that a neural-network-based robust tracking control scheme is established for nonlinear systems involving matched uncertainties.	Semantic Scholar
The augmented system considering the tracking error and the reference trajectory is formulated and then addressed under adaptive critic optimal control formulation, where the initial stabilizing controller is not needed.	Semantic Scholar
The approximate control law is derived via solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation related to the nominal augmented system, followed by closed-loop stability analysis.	Semantic Scholar
The robust tracking control performance is guaranteed theoretically via Lyapunov approach and also verified through simulation illustration.	Semantic Scholar
In minimal invasive surgery, it is important to rebuild and visualize the latest deformed shape of soft-tissue surfaces to mitigate tissue damages.	Semantic Scholar
This letter proposes an innovative Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm for deformable dense reconstruction of surfaces using a sequence of images from a stereoscope.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce a warping field based on the embedded deformation nodes with three-dimensional (3-D) shapes recovered from consecutive pairs of stereo images.	Semantic Scholar
The warping field is estimated by deforming the last updated model to the current live model.	Semantic Scholar
Our SLAM system can incrementally build a live model by progressively fusing new observations with vivid accurate texture; estimate the deformed shape of unobserved region with the principle as-rigid-as-possible; show the consecutive shape of models; and estimate the current relative pose between the soft-tissue and the scope.	Semantic Scholar
In-vivo experiments with publicly available datasets demonstrate that the 3-D models can be incrementally built for different soft-tissues with different deformations from sequences of stereo images obtained by laparoscopes.	Semantic Scholar
Results show the potential clinical application of our SLAM system for providing surgeon useful shape and texture information in minimal invasive surgery.	Semantic Scholar
The manipulation of large objects by robotic systems is a challenge for applications in the construction industry, industrial decommissioning, and urban search and rescue (USAR).	Semantic Scholar
These are associated with dangerous environments and thus motivate devising robotic solutions to replace human presence.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, they often require manipulation of long objects, such as pipes, bars, beams, and metal frameworks, with limited access to their center of mass (CoM).	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a novel approach to predict rating of video-advertisements based on a multimodal framework combining physiological analysis of the user and global sentiment-rating available on the internet.	Semantic Scholar
We have fused Electroencephalogram (EEG) waves of user and corresponding global textual comments of the video to understand the user's preference more precisely.	Semantic Scholar
In our framework, the users were asked to watch the video-advertisement and simultaneously EEG signals were recorded.	Semantic Scholar
Valence scores were obtained using self-report for each video.	Semantic Scholar
A higher valence corresponds to intrinsic attractiveness of the user.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the multimedia data that comprised of the comments posted by global viewers, were retrieved and processed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique for sentiment analysis.	Semantic Scholar
Textual contents from review comments were analyzed to obtain a score to understand sentiment nature of the video.	Semantic Scholar
A regression technique based on Random forest was used to predict the rating of an advertisement using EEG data.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, EEG based rating is combined with NLP-based sentiment score to improve the overall prediction.	Semantic Scholar
The study was carried out using 15 video clips of advertisements available online.	Semantic Scholar
Twenty five participants were involved in our study to analyze our proposed system.	Semantic Scholar
The results are encouraging and these suggest that the proposed multimodal approach can achieve lower RMSE in rating prediction as compared to the prediction using only EEG data.	Semantic Scholar
Perching can extend the useful mission life of a micro air vehicle.	Semantic Scholar
Once perched, climbing allows it to reposition precisely, with low power draw and without regard for weather conditions.	Semantic Scholar
We present the Stanford Climbing and Aerial Maneuvering Platform, which is to our knowledge the first robot capable of flying, perching with passive technology on outdoor surfaces, climbing, and taking off again.	Semantic Scholar
We present the mechanical design and the new perching, climbing, and takeoff strategies that allow us to perform these tasks on surfaces such as concrete and stucco, without the aid of a motion capture system or off-board computation.	Semantic Scholar
We further discuss two new capabilities uniquely available to a hybrid aerial–scansorial robot: the ability to recover gracefully from climbing failures and the ability to increase usable foothold density through the application of aerodynamic forces.	Semantic Scholar
We also measure real power consumption for climbing, flying, and monitoring and discuss how future platforms could be improved for longer mission life.	Semantic Scholar
This letter addresses the problem of distinguishing unexpected collisions from voluntary contacts during human–robot collaboration.	Semantic Scholar
The objective of this letter is to improve the safety of the operator during the interaction with the robot.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the observation that cooperation forces present different frequency characteristics from collisions, a novel model-free method is developed to distinguish contacts using the spectral derivative of the external forces measured by the robot's proprioceptive sensors.	Semantic Scholar
In an experimental comparison with other approaches appeared in the literature, the proposed method presents faster distinction time, in various collaborative or involuntary contacts with multiple subjects.	Semantic Scholar
The apparent “distance” between two configurations of a system and the “length” of trajectories through its configuration space can be significantly distorted by plots that use “natural” or intuitively selected coordinates.	Semantic Scholar
This effect is similar to the way that a latitude–longitude plot of the Earth distorts the size and shape of the continents.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we explore how ideas from cartography can be used to identify system parameterizations that better reflect the effort costs of changing configuration.	Semantic Scholar
We then apply these new parameters to provide geometric insight about two aspects of moving in dissipative environments such as low Reynolds number fluids: The shape of the optimal gait cycle for a three-link swimmer and the fundamentally superior efficiency of a serpenoid swimmer as compared to the classic three-link system.	Semantic Scholar
Algorithms for identifying Voronoi neighbors and constructing Voronoi regions are useful in many distributed robotics applications.	Semantic Scholar
Existing methods that perform these tasks using only the distances between robots assign coordinates to each potential neighbor before applying another algorithm to find the Voronoi neighbors.	Semantic Scholar
Our method finds the Voronoi neighbors more efficiently; identification occurs directly from inter-robot distances, without first assigning coordinates.	Semantic Scholar
We prove the algorithm's correctness, analyze its computational complexity, and demonstrate its effectiveness in the presence of noise via simulation with an experimentally validated sensor model.	Semantic Scholar
Reservoir computing is a recently introduced machine learning paradigm that has been shown to be well-suited for the processing of spatiotemporal data.	Semantic Scholar
Rather than training the network node connections and weights via backpropagation in traditional recurrent neural networks, reservoirs instead have fixed connections and weights among the 'hidden layer' nodes, and traditionally only the weights to the output layer of neurons are trained using linear regression.	Semantic Scholar
We claim that for signal classification tasks one may forgo the weight training step entirely and instead use a simple supervised clustering method based upon principal components of reservoir states.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method is mathematically analyzed and explored through numerical experiments on real-world data.	Semantic Scholar
The examples demonstrate that the proposed may outperform the traditional trained output weight approach in terms of classification accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
Language acquisition theories classically distinguish passive language understanding from active language production.	Semantic Scholar
However, recent findings show that brain areas such as Broca's region are shared in language understanding and production.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, these areas are also implicated in understanding and producing goal-oriented actions.	Semantic Scholar
These observations question the passive view of language development.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we propose a cognitive developmental model of symbol acquisition, coherent with an active view of language learning.	Semantic Scholar
For that purpose, we introduce the concept of social babbling.	Semantic Scholar
In this view, symbols are learned in the same way as goal-oriented actions in the context of specific caregiver-infant interactions.	Semantic Scholar
We show that this model allows a virtual agent to learn both symbolic words and gestures to refer to objects while interacting with a caregiver.	Semantic Scholar
We validate our model by reproducing results from studies on the influence of parental responsiveness on infants language acquisition.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the complexity of modeling deformable materials and infinite degrees of freedom, the rich background of rigid robot control has not been transferred to soft robots.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, most model-based control techniques developed for soft robots and soft haptic interfaces are specific to the particular device.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we develop a general method for stiffness control of soft robots suitable for arbitrary robot geometry and many types of actuation.	Semantic Scholar
Extending previous work that uses finite element modeling for position control, we determine the relationship between end-effector and actuator compliance, including the inherent device compliance, and use this to determine the appropriate controlled actuator stiffness for a desired stiffness of the end-effector.	Semantic Scholar
Such stiffness control, as the first component of impedance control, can be used to compensate for the natural stiffness of the deformable device and to control the robot's interaction with the environment or a user.	Semantic Scholar
We validate the stiffness projection on a deformable robot and include this stiffness projection in a haptic control loop to render a virtual fixture.	Semantic Scholar
Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained in a supervised way suffer from two known problems.	Semantic Scholar
First, the minima of the objective function used in learning correspond to data points (also known as rubbish examples or fooling images) that lack semantic similarity with the training data.	Semantic Scholar
Second, a clean input can be changed by a small, and often imperceptible for human vision, perturbation so that the resulting deformed input is misclassified by the network.	Semantic Scholar
These findings emphasize the differences between the ways DNNs and humans classify patterns and raise a question of designing learning algorithms that more accurately mimic human perception compared to the existing methods.	Semantic Scholar
Our article examines these questions within the framework of dense associative memory (DAM) models.	Semantic Scholar
These models are defined by the energy function, with higher-order (higher than quadratic) interactions between the neurons.	Semantic Scholar
We show that in the limit when the power of the interaction vertex in the energy function is sufficiently large, these models have the following three properties.	Semantic Scholar
First, the minima of the objective function are free from rubbish images, so that each minimum is a semantically meaningful pattern.	Semantic Scholar
Second, artificial patterns poised precisely at the decision boundary look ambiguous to human subjects and share aspects of both classes that are separated by that decision boundary.	Semantic Scholar
Third, adversarial images constructed by models with small power of the interaction vertex, which are equivalent to DNN with rectified linear units, fail to transfer to and fool the models with higher-order interactions.	Semantic Scholar
This opens up the possibility of using higher-order models for detecting and stopping malicious adversarial attacks.	Semantic Scholar
The results we present suggest that DAMs with higher-order energy functions are more robust to adversarial and rubbish inputs than DNNs with rectified linear units.	Semantic Scholar
Acquiring robot assembly skills through human demonstration is an important research problem and can be used to quickly program robots in future manufacturing industries.	Semantic Scholar
To teach robots complex assembly skills, the robots should be able to recognize the objects (parts and tools) involved, the actions applied, and the effect of the actions on the parts.	Semantic Scholar
It is non-trivial to recognize the subtle assembly actions.	Semantic Scholar
To estimate the effect of the actions on the assembly part is also challenging due to the small part sizes.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, using a RGB-D camera, we build a Portable Assembly Demonstration (PAD) system which can automatically recognize the objects (parts/tools) involved, the actions conducted and the assembly states characterizing the spatial relationship among theparts.	Semantic Scholar
The experiment results proved that this PAD system can generate a high level assembly script with decent accuracy in object and action recognition as well as assembly state estimation.	Semantic Scholar
The assembly script is successfully implemented on a Baxter robot.	Semantic Scholar

This letter presents design principles for comfort-centered wearable robots and their application in a lightweight and backdrivable knee exoskeleton.	Semantic Scholar
The mitigation of discomfort is treated as mechanical design and control issues and three solutions are proposed in this letter: 1) a new wearable structure optimizes the strap attachment configuration and suit layout to ameliorate excessive shear forces of conventional wearable structure design; 2) rolling knee joint and double-hinge mechanisms reduce the misalignment in the sagittal and frontal plane, without increasing the mechanical complexity and inertia, respectively; 3) a low impedance mechanical transmission reduces the reflected inertia and damping of the actuator to human, thus the exoskeleton is highlybackdrivable.	Semantic Scholar
Kinematic simulations demonstrate that misalignment between the robot joint and knee joint can be reduced by 74% at maximum knee flexion.	Semantic Scholar
In experiments, the exoskeleton in the unpowered mode exhibits 1.03 Nm root mean square (RMS) low resistive torque.	Semantic Scholar
The torque control experiments demonstrate 0.31 Nm RMS torque tracking error in three human subjects.	Semantic Scholar
Automated Border Control (ABC) in airports and land crossings utilize automated technology to verify passenger identity claims.	Semantic Scholar
Accuracy, interaction stability, user error, and the need for a harmonized approach to implementation are required.	Semantic Scholar
Two models proposed in this paper establish a global path through ABC processes.	Semantic Scholar
The first, the generic model, maps separately the enrolment and verification phases of an ABC scenario.	Semantic Scholar
This allows a standardization of the process and an exploration of variances and similarities between configurations across implementations.	Semantic Scholar
The second, the identity claim process, decomposes the verification phase of the generic model to an enhanced resolution of ABC implementations.	Semantic Scholar
Harnessing a human-biometric sensor interaction framework allows the identification and quantification of errors within the system's use, attributing these errors to either system performance or human interaction.	Semantic Scholar
Data from a live operational scenario are used to analyze behaviors, which aid in establishing what effect these have on system performance.	Semantic Scholar
Utilizing the proposed method will aid already established methods in improving the performance assessment of a system.	Semantic Scholar
Through analyzing interactions and possible behavioral scenarios from the live trial, it was observed that 30.96% of interactions included some major user error.	Semantic Scholar
Future development using our proposed framework will see technological advances for biometric systems that are able to categorize interaction errors and feedback appropriately.	Semantic Scholar

In sustainable farming, robotic solutions are in rising demand.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically robots for precision agriculture open up possibilities for new applications.	Semantic Scholar
Such applications typically require a high accuracy of the underlying navigation system.	Semantic Scholar
A cornerstone for reliable navigation is the robust detection of crop rows.	Semantic Scholar
However, detecting crops from vision or laser data is particularly challenging when the plants are either tiny or so large that individual plants cannot be distinguished easily.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a pipeline for reliable plant segmentation in any crop growth stage, as well as a novel algorithm for robust crop row detection that adapts the Hough transform for line detection to detect a pattern of parallel equidistant lines.	Semantic Scholar
Our algorithm is able to jointly estimate the angle, lateral offset and crop row spacing and is particularly suited for tiny plants.	Semantic Scholar
In extensive experiments using various real-world data sets from different kinds and sizes of crops we show that our algorithm provides reliable and accurate results.	Semantic Scholar
We present large scale facial model (LSFM)—a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) automatically constructed from 9663 distinct facial identities.	Semantic Scholar
To the best of our knowledge LSFM is the largest-scale Morphable Model ever constructed, containing statistical information from a huge variety of the human population.	Semantic Scholar
To build such a large model we introduce a novel fully automated and robust Morphable Model construction pipeline, informed by an evaluation of state-of-the-art dense correspondence techniques.	Semantic Scholar
The dataset that LSFM is trained on includes rich demographic information about each subject, allowing for the construction of not only a global 3DMM model but also models tailored for specific age, gender or ethnicity groups.	Semantic Scholar
We utilize the proposed model to perform age classification from 3D shape alone and to reconstruct noisy out-of-sample data in the low-dimensional model space.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we perform a systematic analysis of the constructed 3DMM models that showcases their quality and descriptive power.	Semantic Scholar
The presented extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations reveal that the proposed 3DMM achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing models by a large margin.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, for the benefit of the research community, we make publicly available the source code of the proposed automatic 3DMM construction pipeline, as well as the constructed global 3DMM and a variety of bespoke models tailored by age, gender and ethnicity.	Semantic Scholar
Finding a set of diverse paths among dynamic obstacles is an appealing navigation strategy for mobile robots to qualitatively reason about multiple path hypotheses to the goal.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce an efficient randomized approach, based on weighted random walks, that finds $K$ diverse paths on the Voronoi diagram of the environment, where each path represents a distinct homotopy class.	Semantic Scholar
We show experimentally that our approach is significantly faster at finding paths of higher diversity in distinct homotopy classes than two state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we prove that our method is probabilistically complete.	Semantic Scholar
Many machine learning and data-related applications require the knowledge of approximate ranks of large data matrices at hand.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents two computationally inexpensive techniques to estimate the approximate ranks of such matrices.	Semantic Scholar
These techniques exploit approximate spectral densities, popular in physics, which are probability density distributions that measure the likelihood of finding eigenvalues of the matrix at a given point on the real line.	Semantic Scholar
Integrating the spectral density over an interval gives the eigenvalue count of the matrix in that interval.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, the rank can be approximated by integrating the spectral density over a carefully selected interval.	Semantic Scholar
Two different approaches are discussed to estimate the approximate rank, one based on Chebyshev polynomials and the other based on the Lanczos algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
In order to obtain the appropriate interval, it is necessary to locate a gap between the eigenvalues that correspond to noise and the relevant eigenvalues that contribute to the matrix rank.	Semantic Scholar
A method for locating this gap and selecting the interval of integration is proposed based on the plot of the spectral density.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical experiments illustrate the performance of these techniques on matrices from typical applications.	Semantic Scholar
Robots used for inspection, package deliveries, moving of goods, and other logistics operations are often required to visit certain locations within specified time bounds.	Semantic Scholar
This gives rise to a challenging problem as it requires not only planning collision-free and dynamically feasible motions but also reasoning temporally about when and where the robot should be.	Semantic Scholar
While significant progress has been made in integrating task and motion planning, there are still no effective approaches for multigoal motion planning when both dynamics and time windows must be satisfied.	Semantic Scholar
To effectively solve this challenging problem, this paper develops an approach that couples temporal planning over a discrete abstraction with sampling-based motion planning over the continuous state space of feasible motions.	Semantic Scholar
The discrete abstraction is obtained by imposing a roadmap that captures the connectivity of the free space.	Semantic Scholar
At each iteration of a core loop, the approach first invokes the temporal planner to find a solution over the roadmap abstraction.	Semantic Scholar
In a second step, the approach uses sampling to expand a motion tree along the regions associated with the discrete solution.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments are conducted with second-order ground and aerial vehicle models operating in complex environments.	Semantic Scholar
Results demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the approach as we increase the number of goals and the difficulty of satisfying the time bounds.	Semantic Scholar
Kohonen's Self Organizing feature Map (SOM) provides an effective way to project high dimensional input features onto a low dimensional display space while preserving the topological relationships among the input features.	Semantic Scholar
Recent advances in algorithms that take advantages of modern computing hardware introduced the concept of high resolution SOMs (HRSOMs).	Semantic Scholar
This paper investigates the capabilities and applicability of the HRSOM as a visualization tool for cluster analysis and its suitabilities to serve as a pre-processor in ensemble learning models.	Semantic Scholar
The evaluation is conducted on a number of established benchmarks and real-world learning problems, namely, the policeman benchmark, two web spam detection problems, a network intrusion detection problem, and a malware detection problem.	Semantic Scholar
It is found that the visualization resulted from an HRSOM provides new insights concerning these learning problems.	Semantic Scholar
It is furthermore shown empirically that broad benefits from the use of HRSOMs in both clustering and classification problems can be expected.	Semantic Scholar
This letter addresses the challenge of determining the optimal design of a customizable robot for a given task.	Semantic Scholar
We present a motion planner that not only prescribes a path, but also synthesizes the robot design to follow that path.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach treats design variables as part of an inverse kinematics problem to jointly optimize manipulator design parameters and trajectory.	Semantic Scholar
We apply our method to two distinct problems where rapid prototyping and customization are desirable: an arm prototyped for a future Mars mission, and a wearable backpack-mounted arm.	Semantic Scholar
We then propose a novel method to minimize the number of joints in the mechanism while maintaining its ability to reach workspace task poses.	Semantic Scholar
We combine these methods into a framework in which we iteratively optimize and simplify task-specialized manipulator designs.	Semantic Scholar
This paper introduces an agent-based approach to study customer behavior in terms of their acceptance of new business models in Circular Economy (CE) context.	Semantic Scholar
In a CE customers are perceived as integral part of the business and therefore customer acceptance of new business models becomes crucial as it determines the successful implementation of CE.	Semantic Scholar
However, tools or methods are missing to capture customer behavior to assess how customers will react if an organization introduces a new business model such as leasing or functional sales.	Semantic Scholar
The purpose of this research is to bring forward a quantitative analysis tool for identifying proper marketing and pricing strategies to obtain best fit demand behavior for the chosen new business model.	Semantic Scholar
This tool will support decision makers in determining the impact of introducing new (circular) business models.	Semantic Scholar
The model has been developed using an agent-based modeling approach which delivers results based on socio-demographic factors of a population and customers’ relative preferences of product attributes price, environmental friendliness and service-orientation.	Semantic Scholar
The implementation of the model has been tested using the practical business example of a washing machine.	Semantic Scholar
This research presents the first agent-based tool that can assess customer behavior and determine whether introduction of new business models will be accepted or not and how customer acceptance can be influenced to accelerate CE implementation.	Semantic Scholar
The tool integrates socio-demographic factors, product utility functions, social network structures and inter-agent communication in order to comprehensively describe behavior on individual customer level.	Semantic Scholar
In addition to the tool itself the results of this research indicates the need for systematic marketing strategies which emphasize CE value propositions in order to accelerate customer acceptance and shorten the transition time from linear to circular.	Semantic Scholar
Agent-based models are emphasized as highly capable to fill the gap between diffusion-based penetration of information and resulting behavior in the form of purchase decisions.	Semantic Scholar
Endovascular surgery has gained broad acceptance in the last few years.	Semantic Scholar
The current practice of endovascular procedures is limited by factors including patient-specific operation requirements, high-risk surgery procedures, and time-consuming operations.	Semantic Scholar
To address this, magnetically actuated surgical catheters have been introduced to the field of surgical robotics.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, advances in steerable catheters and developments in magnetic steering have been studied.	Semantic Scholar
However, limited research has been conducted to quantify the effectiveness of magnetic actuation for catheterization procedures.	Semantic Scholar
Endovascular interventions employing magnetically actuated catheters deliver the promise of higher accuracy and shorter duration when compared to current, manual techniques.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, they allow surgeons access to areas of cardiovascular systems that cannot be reached with standard, minimally invasive techniques.	Semantic Scholar
Autonomous systems will play an essential role in many applications across diverse domains including space, marine, air, field, road, and service robotics.	Semantic Scholar
They will assist us in our daily routines and perform dangerous, dirty, and dull tasks.	Semantic Scholar
However, enabling robotic systems to perform autonomously in complex, real-world scenarios over extended time periods (i.e., weeks, months, or years) poses many challenges.	Semantic Scholar
Some of these have been investigated by subdisciplines of Artificial Intelligence (AI) including navigation and mapping, perception, knowledge representation and reasoning, planning, interaction, and learning.	Semantic Scholar
The different subdisciplines have developed techniques that, when re-integrated within an autonomous system, can enable robots to operate effectively in complex, long-term scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we survey and discuss AI techniques as “enablers” for long-term robot autonomy, current progress in integrating these techniques within long-running robotic systems, and the future challenges and opportunities for AI in long-term autonomy.	Semantic Scholar
By introducing sign constraints on the weights, this paper proposes sign constrained rectifier networks (SCRNs), whose training can be solved efficiently by the well known majorization-minimization (MM) algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
We prove that the proposed two-hidden-layer SCRNs, which exhibit negative weights in the second hidden layer and negative weights in the output layer, are capable of separating any number of disjoint pattern sets.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the proposed two-hidden-layer SCRNs can decompose the patterns of each class into several clusters so that each cluster is convexly separable from all the patterns from the other classes.	Semantic Scholar
This provides a means to learn the pattern structures and analyse the discriminant factors between different classes of patterns.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results are provided to show the benefits of sign constraints in improving classification performance and the efficiency of the proposed MM algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we address the autonomous flight of a small quadrotor, enabling tracking of a moving object.	Semantic Scholar
The 15-cm diameter, 250-g robot relies only on onboard sensors (a single camera and an inertial measurement unit) and computers, and can detect, localize, and track moving objects.	Semantic Scholar
Our key contributions include the relative pose estimate of a spherical target as well as the planning algorithm, which considers the dynamics of the underactuated robot, the actuator limitations, and the field of view constraints.	Semantic Scholar
We show simulation and experimental results to demonstrate feasibility and performance, as well as robustness to abrupt variations in target motion.	Semantic Scholar
Networked observational devices have proliferated in recent years, contributing to voluminous data streams from a variety of sources and problem domains.	Semantic Scholar
These streams often have a spatiotemporal component and include multidimensional features of interest.	Semantic Scholar
Processing such data in an offline fashion using batch systems or data warehouses is costly from both a storage and computational standpoint, and in many situations the insights derived from the data streams are useful only if they are timely.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we propose Synopsis, an online, distributed sketch that is constructed from voluminous spatiotemporal data streams.	Semantic Scholar
The sketch summarizes feature values and inter-feature relationships in memory to facilitate real-time query evaluations and to serve as input to computations expressed using analytical engines.	Semantic Scholar
As the data streams evolve, Synopsis performs targeted dynamic scaling to ensure high accuracy and effective resource utilization.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our system in the context of two real-world spatiotemporal datasets and demonstrate its efficacy in both scalability and query evaluations.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a new approach to tackle the problem of infinite chattering, observed at bang-singular junctions of the minimum-time trajectories of car-like robots with bounded angular acceleration control.	Semantic Scholar
To eliminate chattering from time-optimal control solutions, we propose to relax the ideal nonholonomic constraint of no-skidding.	Semantic Scholar
A proof is presented to demonstrate that this relaxation eliminates chattering from the bang-singular junctions.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, a solution to the time-optimal synthesis under the condition of small skid angles is provided.	Semantic Scholar
We propose topic models for unsupervised cluster matching, which is the task of finding matching between clusters in different domains without correspondence information.	Semantic Scholar
For example, the proposed model finds correspondence between document clusters in English and German without alignment information, such as dictionaries and parallel sentences/documents.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed model assumes that documents in all languages have a common latent topic structure, and there are potentially infinite number of topic proportion vectors in a latent topic space that is shared by all languages.	Semantic Scholar
Each document is generated using one of the topic proportion vectors and language-specific word distributions.	Semantic Scholar
By inferring a topic proportion vector used for each document, we can allocate documents in different languages into common clusters, where each cluster is associated with a topic proportion vector.	Semantic Scholar
Documents assigned into the same cluster are considered to be matched.	Semantic Scholar
We develop an efficient inference procedure for the proposed model based on collapsed Gibbs sampling.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated with real data sets including multilingual corpora of Wikipedia and product reviews.	Semantic Scholar
We present a novel deep neural network architecture for representing robot experiences in an episodic-like memory that facilitates encoding, recalling, and predicting action experiences.	Semantic Scholar
Our proposed unsupervised deep episodic memory model as follows: First, encodes observed actions in a latent vector space and, based on this latent encoding, second, infers most similar episodes previously experienced, third, reconstructs original episodes, and finally, predicts future frames in an end-to-end fashion.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that conceptually similar actions are mapped into the same region of the latent vector space.	Semantic Scholar
Based on these results, we introduce an action matching and retrieval mechanism, benchmark its performance on two large-scale action datasets, 20BN-something-something and ActivityNet and evaluate its generalization capability in a real-world scenario on a humanoid robot.	Semantic Scholar
Flash technology trends have shown that greater densities between flash memory cells increase read/write error rates and shorten solid-state drive (SSD) device lifetimes.	Semantic Scholar
This is critical for enterprise systems, causing such problems as service instability and increased total cost of ownership (TCO) because of SSD replacement.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, numerous studies have focused on decreasing the amount of the DBMS writes.	Semantic Scholar
However, there has been no research that focused on decreasing the amount of temporary writes, which are primarily created by join processing.	Semantic Scholar
In DBMSs, there are two major join-processing algorithms, i.e., hybrid hash join (HHJ) and sort merge join (SMJ), proven to be the best according to DBMS workload; however, the two algorithms produce temporary writes of intermediate results.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we instead look to the block-nested loop join (BNLJ); it is well-known that the two algorithms are better than BNLJ, but BNLJ creates no intermediate result writes.	Semantic Scholar
It is reasonable to use BNLJ for a major join algorithm if its performance can be enhanced similar to those of HHJ and SMJ, considering BNLJ's advantage of extending SSD lifetimes.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, in this paper, we propose an advanced BNLJ (ANLJ) algorithm that can match the performance of the two main join algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Database provenance explains how results are derived by queries.	Semantic Scholar
However, many use cases such as auditing and debugging of transactions require understanding of how the current state of a database was derived by a transactional history.	Semantic Scholar
We present MV-semirings, a provenance model for queries and transactional histories that supports two common multi-version concurrency control protocols: snapshot isolation (SI) and read committed snapshot isolation (RC-SI).	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we introduce an approach for retroactively capturing such provenance using reenactment, a novel technique for replaying a transactional history with provenance capture.	Semantic Scholar
Reenactment exploits the time travel and audit logging capabilities of modern DBMS to replay parts of a transactional history using queries.	Semantic Scholar
Importantly, our technique requires no changes to the transactional workload or underlying DBMS and results in only moderate runtime overhead for transactions.	Semantic Scholar
We have implemented our approach on top of a commercial DBMS and our experiments confirm that by applying novel optimizations we can efficiently capture provenance for complex transactions over large data sets.	Semantic Scholar
Mixture of autoregressions (MoAR) models provide a model-based approach to the clustering of time series data.	Semantic Scholar
The maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of MoAR models requires evaluating products of large numbers of densities of normal random variables.	Semantic Scholar
In practical scenarios, these products converge to zero as the length of the time series increases, and thus the ML estimation of MoAR models becomes infeasible without the use of numerical tricks.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a maximum pseudolikelihood (MPL) estimation approach as an alternative to the use of numerical tricks.	Semantic Scholar
The MPL estimator is proved to be consistent and can be computed with an EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Simulations are used to assess the performance of the MPL estimator against that of the ML estimator in cases where the latter was able to be calculated.	Semantic Scholar
An application to the clustering of time series data arising from a resting state fMRI experiment is presented as a demonstration of the methodology.	Semantic Scholar
The sound of crashing waves, the roar of fast-moving cars—sound conveys important information about the objects in our surroundings.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we show that ambient sounds can be used as a supervisory signal for learning visual models.	Semantic Scholar
To demonstrate this, we train a convolutional neural network to predict a statistical summary of the sound associated with a video frame.	Semantic Scholar
We show that, through this process, the network learns a representation that conveys information about objects and scenes.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate this representation on several recognition tasks, finding that its performance is comparable to that of other state-of-the-art unsupervised learning methods.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we show through visualizations that the network learns units that are selective to objects that are often associated with characteristic sounds.	Semantic Scholar

Underwater manipulation is a challenging problem.	Semantic Scholar
The state-of-the-art technology is dominated by remotely operated vehicles (ROVs).	Semantic Scholar
ROV operations typically require an offshore crew consisting of, at minimum, an intendant (or supervisor), an operator, and a navigator.	Semantic Scholar
This crew must often be doubled or even tripled due to work shifts.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, customer representatives often wish to be physically present offshore.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, underwater intervention missions are still dominated by a significant amount of lowlevel, manual control of the manipulator(s) and of the vehicle itself.	Semantic Scholar
While there is a significant amount of research on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in general and fieldable solutions already exist for inspection and exploration missions, possibilities remain for adding intelligent autonomous functions for interventions.	Semantic Scholar
In the information filtering paradigm, clients subscribe to a server with continuous queries that express their information needs and get notified every time appropriate information is published.	Semantic Scholar
To perform this task in an efficient way, servers employ indexing schemes that support fast matches of the incoming information with the query database.	Semantic Scholar
Such indexing schemes involve (i) main-memory trie-based data structures that cluster similar queries by capturing common elements between them and (ii) efficient filtering mechanisms that exploit this clustering to achieve high throughput and low filtering times.	Semantic Scholar
However, state-of-the-art indexing schemes are sensitive to the query insertion order and cannot adopt to an evolving query workload, degrading the filtering performance over time.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present an adaptive trie-based algorithm that outperforms current methods by relying on query statistics to reorganise the query database.	Semantic Scholar
Contrary to previous approaches, we show that the nature of the constructed tries, rather than their compactness, is the determining factor for efficient filtering performance.	Semantic Scholar
Our algorithm does not depend on the order of insertion of queries in the database, manages to cluster queries even when clustering possibilities are limited, and achieves more than 96 percent filtering time improvement over its state-of-the-art competitors.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we demonstrate that our solution is easily extensible to multi-core machines.	Semantic Scholar
The amount of sensory data manifests an explosive growth due to the increasing popularity of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs).	Semantic Scholar
The scale of sensory data in many applications has already exceeded several petabytes annually, which is beyond the computation and transmission capabilities of conventional WSNs.	Semantic Scholar
On the other hand, the information carried by big sensory data has high redundancy because of strong correlation among sensory data.	Semantic Scholar

Semantic object parts can be useful for several visual recognition tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Lately, these tasks have been addressed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), achieving outstanding results.	Semantic Scholar
In this work we study whether CNNs learn semantic parts in their internal representation.	Semantic Scholar
We investigate the responses of convolutional filters and try to associate their stimuli with semantic parts.	Semantic Scholar
We perform two extensive quantitative analyses.	Semantic Scholar
First, we use ground-truth part bounding-boxes from the PASCAL-Part dataset to determine how many of those semantic parts emerge in the CNN.	Semantic Scholar
We explore this emergence for different layers, network depths, and supervision levels.	Semantic Scholar
Second, we collect human judgements in order to study what fraction of all filters systematically fire on any semantic part, even if not annotated in PASCAL-Part.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we explore several connections between discriminative power and semantics.	Semantic Scholar
We find out which are the most discriminative filters for object recognition, and analyze whether they respond to semantic parts or to other image patches.	Semantic Scholar
We also investigate the other direction: we determine which semantic parts are the most discriminative and whether they correspond to those parts emerging in the network.	Semantic Scholar
This enables to gain an even deeper understanding of the role of semantic parts in the network.	Semantic Scholar
This paper investigates pinning synchronization of coupled neural networks with both current-state coupling and distributed-delay coupling via impulsive control.	Semantic Scholar
A novel impulse pinning strategy involving pinning ratio is proposed and a general criterion is derived to ensure an array of neural networks with two different topologies synchronizes with the desired trajectory.	Semantic Scholar
In order to handle the difficulties of high-dimension criteria, some inequality techniques and matrix decomposition methods through simultaneous diagonalization of two matrices are introduced and low-dimensional criteria are obtained.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, an illustrative example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents safety barrier certificates that ensure scalable and provably collision-free behaviors in multirobot systems by modifying the nominal controllers to formally satisfy safety constraints.	Semantic Scholar
This is achieved by minimizing the difference between the actual and the nominal controllers subject to safety constraints.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting computation of the safety controllers is done through a quadratic programming problem that can be solved in real-time and in this paper, we describe a series of problems of increasing complexity.	Semantic Scholar
Starting with a centralized formulation, where the safety controller is computed across all agents simultaneously, we show how one can achieve a natural decentralization whereby individual robots only have to remain safe relative to nearby robots.	Semantic Scholar
Conservativeness and existence of solutions as well as deadlock-avoidance are then addressed using a mixture of relaxed control barrier functions, hybrid braking controllers, and consistent perturbations.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting control strategy is verified experimentally on a collection of wheeled mobile robots whose nominal controllers are explicitly designed to make the robots collide.	Semantic Scholar
In highly dynamic tasks that involve moving targets, planning is necessary to figure out when, where and how to intercept the target.	Semantic Scholar
In robotic table tennis in particular, motion planning can be very challenging due to time constraints, dimension of the search space and joint limits.	Semantic Scholar
Conventional planning algorithms often rely on a fixed virtual hitting plane to construct robot striking trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
These algorithms, however, generate restrictive strokes and can result in unnatural strategies when compared with human playing.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we introduce a new trajectory generation framework for robotic table tennis that does not involve a fixed hitting plane.	Semantic Scholar
A free-time optimal control approach is used to derive two different trajectory optimizers.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting two algorithms, Focused Player and Defensive Player, encode two different play-styles.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate their performance in simulation and in our robot table tennis platform with a high speed cable-driven seven DOF robot arm.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithms return the balls with a higher probability to the opponent’s court when compared with a virtual hitting plane basedmethod.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, both can be run online and the trajectories can be corrected with new ball observations.	Semantic Scholar

Alpha matting, the process of extracting opacity mask of the foreground in an image, is an important task in image and video editing.	Semantic Scholar
All of the matting methods need exploit the relationships between pixels.	Semantic Scholar
The traditional propagation-based methods construct constrains based on nonlocal principle and color line model to reflect the relationships.	Semantic Scholar
However, these methods would produce artifacts if the constrains are not reliable.	Semantic Scholar
So we improve this problem in three points.	Semantic Scholar
Firstly, we design a novel feature called sumD feature to increase the pixel discrimination.	Semantic Scholar
This feature is simple and could encourage pixels with similar texture to have similar feature values.	Semantic Scholar
Secondly, we design a three-layer graph framework to construct nonlocal constrains.	Semantic Scholar
This framework finds constrains in multi-scale range and selects reliable constrains, then unifies nonlocal constrains according to their reliabilities.	Semantic Scholar
Thirdly, we develop a new label extension method to add hard constrains.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results confirm that the effectiveness of the three changes, and the proposed method achieves high rank on the benchmark dataset.	Semantic Scholar

Needle insertion procedures under ultrasound guidance are commonly used for diagnosis and therapy.	Semantic Scholar
It is often critical to accurately reach a targeted region, and this can be difficult to achieve due to intraoperative tissue motion.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a method to steer a beveled-tip flexible needle toward a target embedded in moving tissue.	Semantic Scholar
Needle steering is performed using a needle insertion device attached to a robot arm.	Semantic Scholar
Closed-loop 3-D steering of the needle is achieved using tracking of an artificial target in 2-D ultrasound images and tracking of the needle tip position and orientation with an electromagnetic tracker.	Semantic Scholar
Tissue motion compensation is performed using force feedback to reduce targeting error and forces applied to the tissue.	Semantic Scholar
The method uses a mechanics-based interaction model that is updated online.	Semantic Scholar
A novel control law using task functions is proposed to fuse motion compensation, steering via base manipulation and tip-based steering.	Semantic Scholar
Validation of the tracking and steering algorithms are performed in gelatin phantom and bovine liver.	Semantic Scholar

Fraudulent behaviors in Google Play, the most popular Android app market, fuel search rank abuse and malware proliferation.	Semantic Scholar
To identify malware, previous work has focused on app executable and permission analysis.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we introduce FairPlay, a novel system that discovers and leverages traces left behind by fraudsters, to detect both malware and apps subjected to search rank fraud.	Semantic Scholar
FairPlay correlates review activities and uniquely combines detected review relations with linguistic and behavioral signals gleaned from Google Play app data (87 K apps, 2.9 M reviews, and 2.4M reviewers, collected over half a year), in order to identify suspicious apps.	Semantic Scholar
FairPlay achieves over 95 percent accuracy in classifying gold standard datasets of malware, fraudulent and legitimate apps.	Semantic Scholar
We show that 75 percent of the identified malware apps engage in search rank fraud.	Semantic Scholar
FairPlay discovers hundreds of fraudulent apps that currently evade Google Bouncer's detection technology.	Semantic Scholar
FairPlay also helped the discovery of more than 1,000 reviews, reported for 193 apps, that reveal a new type of “coercive” review campaign: users are harassed into writing positive reviews, and install and review other apps.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we consider the problem of letting an aerial robot exploiting its contact with the environment in order to enhance its motion possibilities, in a way reminiscent of legged robots exploiting contact forces for locomotion purposes.	Semantic Scholar
As a representative and initial case study, we consider a quadrotor equipped with a 1-degree of freedom (DOF) arm able to hook at some pivot points, and needing to perform a maneuver from an initial hooked configuration to a final hooked configuration while passing though a free-flight phase between the two anchor points.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we propose a dynamical modeling able to capture the various phases (hooked, free-flying) together with an optimization framework for generating optimal motion plans compatible with actuation constraints.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the approach and the promising potential in terms of more advanced maneuvers.	Semantic Scholar
Robust and fast motion estimation and mapping is a key prerequisite for autonomous operation of mobile robots.	Semantic Scholar
The goal of performing this task solely on a stereo pair of video cameras is highly demanding and bears conflicting objectives: on one hand, the motion has to be tracked fast and reliably, on the other hand, high-level functions like navigation and obstacle avoidance depend crucially on a complete and accurate environment representation.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we propose a two-layer approach for visual odometry and SLAM with stereo cameras that runs in real-time and combines featurebased matching with semi-dense direct image alignment.	Semantic Scholar
Our method initializes semi-dense depth estimation, which is computationally expensive, from motion that is tracked by a fast but robust keypoint-based method.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on public benchmark and proprietary datasets show that our approach is faster than state-of-the-art methods without losing accuracy and yields comparable map building capabilities.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, our approach is shown to handle large inter-frame motion and illumination changes much more robustly than its direct counterparts.	Semantic Scholar
unknown	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, visual servoing based on photometric moments is advocated.	Semantic Scholar
A direct approach is chosen by which the extraction of geometric primitives, visual tracking and image matching steps of a conventional visual servoing pipeline can be bypassed.	Semantic Scholar
A vital challenge in photometric methods is the change in the image resulting from the appearance and disappearance of portions of the scene from the camera field of view during the servo.	Semantic Scholar
To tackle this issue, a general model for the photometric moments enhanced with spatial weighting is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
The interaction matrix for these spatially weighted photometric moments is derived in an analytical form.	Semantic Scholar
The correctness of the modeling, effectiveness of the proposed strategy in handling the exogenous regions, and improved convergence domain are demonstrated with a combination of simulation and the experimental results.	Semantic Scholar
Robotic needle steering will improve percutaneous radio-frequency ablation (RFA) in the liver by performing distributed ablations without requiring multiple punctures of the liver capsule, thus enabling the treatment of large or multifocal tumors.	Semantic Scholar
However, state-of-the-art asymmetric-tip robotic needle steering systems do not yet achieve clinically relevant curvature.	Semantic Scholar
This work presents the design and development of a highly articulated needle that enables distributed RFA in liver tissue under ultrasound (US) image guidance.	Semantic Scholar
Our new needle design attains the target curvature required for liver procedures while meeting important clinical requirements, such as the use of fixed diameter needle introducers, presence of a free needle working channel, robustness for repeated insertions, and conductivity for the delivery of RF current for tissue ablation.	Semantic Scholar
The new needle tip includes two important design features: A tendon-actuated Nitinol asymmetric flexure joint, which allows for an active amplification of the needle steering force, and a steel back-bevel tip profile, which decreases the risk of needle jamming.	Semantic Scholar
The needle's resulting curvature was evaluated in both phantom and ex vivo liver tissues using segmented US images.	Semantic Scholar
The average radius of minimum curvature in ex vivo liver tissue was found to be 33.6 mm, the smallest reported to date.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, RFA in ex vivo porcine liver tissue tests were performed to demonstrate that distributed ablation with a single puncture of the liver capsule is possible via robotic needle steering.	Semantic Scholar
Robot Motion Planning (RMP) has been a thrust area of research in computing due to its complexity, since RMP in dynamic environments for a point robot with bounded velocity is an NP-hard problem.	Semantic Scholar

Between 1985 and 2015 the focus has changed from the classical approach to a heuristic approach.	Semantic Scholar
For velocity based motion planning in dynamic environments, ICS AVOID [4, also see Section 2.4.4] is the safest approach which means that this method have the capability of for an autonomous robotic system to avoid collision with the obstacles in the environment.	Semantic Scholar

Payload manipulation with aerial robots has been an active research area for many years.	Semantic Scholar
Recent approaches have sought to plan, control, and execute maneuvers with large, yet deliberate, load swings for more agile, energy-optimal maneuvering.	Semantic Scholar
Unfortunately, the system's nonlinear dynamics make executing such trajectories a significant challenge and experimental demonstrations thus far have relied completely on a motion capture system and non-negligible simplifications like restriction of the system to a two-dimensional workspace or closing of the control loop on the quadrotor, instead of the payload.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we observe the payload using a downward-facing camera and estimate its state relative to the quadrotor using an extended Kalman filter.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate closed-loop payload control in the full three-dimensional workspace, with the planning, estimation, and control pipeline implemented on an onboard processor.	Semantic Scholar
We show control of load swings up to 53º from the vertical axis.	Semantic Scholar
To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first realization of closed-loop control of agile slung-load maneuvers and the largest achieved payload angle.	Semantic Scholar
Electrical isolation using the ablation catheter has been widely used as the golden standard for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.	Semantic Scholar
Clinical practice shows that the tip orientation affects the formation of the effective lesion size.	Semantic Scholar
However, the traditional unidirectional or bidirectional catheter with the compliant bending shapes cannot provide great orientation capability to target the lesion paths asymmetric to the catheter's entry point.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a two-dimensional (2-D) tendon-actuated asymmetric catheter to render two different bending characteristics to adapt to the special anatomy.	Semantic Scholar
The contact-aided compliant mechanism is adopted by designing the asymmetric blocks to form the self-collision in one lateral bending direction.	Semantic Scholar
Kinematics with asymmetric bends under the free bend and constraint bend are investigated.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm of 3-D path exploration in the confined workspace is proposed to validate the reachability.	Semantic Scholar
The bending angles of two asymmetric bends are compared and the 3-D phantom study is carried out to validate its effectiveness.	Semantic Scholar
Results indicate that the contact-aided compliant mechanism can be integrated with the steerable catheter successfully to help form the different bending characteristics, finally improving the tip orientation capability to the specific ablation line lesions.	Semantic Scholar
In many 3-D perception applications, ground segmentation is a necessary preprocessing phase together with point cloud cleaning and outlier removal.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a method for ground segmentation in large-scale point clouds of industrial environments acquired using a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS).	Semantic Scholar
TLSs provide high-precision, dense 3-D measurements, and therefore, such instruments are becoming the state of the art technology for surveying tasks.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to many previous works, where ground segmentation has been investigated using a single scan (e.g., in LiDAR-equipped vehicles), experiments have been performed in large-scale point clouds that contain over $10^{10}$ points measured from multiple scan stations.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed solution is based on a robust estimation of points belonging to the ground below each scan station and it can be applied even in challenging scenarios with nonplanar regions.	Semantic Scholar
String similarity join, as an essential operation in applications including data integration and data cleaning, has attracted significant attention in the research community.	Semantic Scholar
Previous studies focus on global similarity join.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study local similarity join with edit distance constraints, which finds string pairs from two string collections that have similar substrings.	Semantic Scholar
We study two kinds of local similarity join problems: checking local similar pairs and locating local similar pairs.	Semantic Scholar
We first consider the case where if two strings are locally similar to each other, they must share a common gram of a certain length.	Semantic Scholar
We show how to do efficient local similarity verification based on a matching gram pair.	Semantic Scholar
We propose two pruning techniques and an incremental method to further improve the efficiency of finding matching gram pairs.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we devise a method to locate the longest similar substring pair for two local similar strings.	Semantic Scholar
We conducted a comprehensive experimental study to evaluate the efficiency of these techniques.	Semantic Scholar

We present an oscillatory neural network model that can account for reaction times in visual search experiments.	Semantic Scholar
The model consists of a central oscillator that represents the central executive of the attention system and a number of peripheral oscillators that represent objects in the display.	Semantic Scholar
The oscillators are described as generalized Kuramoto type oscillators with adapted parameters.	Semantic Scholar
An object is considered as being included in the focus of attention if the oscillator associated with this object is in-phase with the central oscillator.	Semantic Scholar
The probability for an object to be included in the focus of attention is determined by its saliency that is described in formal terms as the strength of the connection from the peripheral oscillator to the central oscillator.	Semantic Scholar
By computer simulations it is shown that the model can reproduce reaction times in visual search tasks of various complexities.	Semantic Scholar
The dependence of the reaction time on the number of items in the display is represented by linear functions of different steepness which is in agreement with biological evidence.	Semantic Scholar
In the field of crowd behavior analysis, existing methods mainly focus on using local representations inspired by models found in other disciplines (e.g., fluid dynamics and social dynamics) to describe motion patterns.	Semantic Scholar
However, less attention is paid to exploiting motion structures (e.g., visual information contained in trajectories) for behavior analysis.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we consider both local characteristics and global structures of a motion vector field, and propose the Curl and Divergence of motion Trajectories (CDT) descriptors to describe collective motion patterns.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, a trajectory-based motion coding algorithm is designed to extract the CDT descriptors.	Semantic Scholar
For each motion vector field we construct its conjugate field, in which each vector is perpendicular to the counterpart in the original vector field.	Semantic Scholar
The trajectories in the motion and corresponding conjugate fields indicate the tangential and radial motion structures, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
By integrating curl (and divergence, respectively) along the tangential paths (and the radial paths, respectively), the CDT descriptors are extracted.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the proposed motion descriptors are scale- and rotation-invariant for effective crowd behavior analysis.	Semantic Scholar
For concreteness, we apply the CDT descriptors to identify five typical crowd behaviors (lane, clockwise arch, counterclockwise arch, bottleneck and fountainhead) with a pipeline including motion decomposition.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the CDT descriptors for describing and classifying crowd behaviors.	Semantic Scholar

In many physical human–robot interaction scenarios, for successful completion of the tasks, robots should be able to recognize the human partner's intention.	Semantic Scholar
One of such scenarios that is studied in this letter is the collaborative task of carrying an object by a human–humanoid pair in which the humanoid should be able to interpret specific human partner's intentions (e.g., start/stop-walking, accelerate, etc.)	Semantic Scholar
only through haptic feedback.	Semantic Scholar
To address this problem, we first performed human-human experiments and obtained a multiclass classifier (with more than 90% of accuracy) for human intention detection using, as features, arm position relative to the shoulder and interaction forces.	Semantic Scholar
The results of the multiclass classification, without any modifications, have been used to develop an interlimb coordinator that was integrated in a modular control architecture into human-robot experiments.	Semantic Scholar
The interlimb coordinator receives the sensory data of the upper-body and sends appropriate commands (including start/stop-walking, accelerate, and decelerate commands) to the lower body controller, which is responsible for achieving a stable walking gait.	Semantic Scholar
This modular control approach is successfully tested in the human–humanoid experiments with the COMAN robot.	Semantic Scholar
In a previous study, a tethered pelvic-assist device (TPAD) was used to successfully retrain crouch gait in children with cerebral palsy by applying a downward force on the pelvis while walking on a treadmill.	Semantic Scholar
While the results of this study were promising, an important issue was to translate this training to the children in a more practical manner.	Semantic Scholar
This motivated the question in this letter whether a different intervention could result in similar improvements in the gait as seen with the TPAD.	Semantic Scholar
This is the motivation for this study, which compares the biomechanical differences in walking under the following two conditions.	Semantic Scholar
1) The TPAD applies a pure downward force on the pelvis using tethers.	Semantic Scholar
2) A weighted pelvic belt is used to apply the same downward force on the pelvis.	Semantic Scholar
In this case, the weight belt also increases the mass at the pelvis.	Semantic Scholar
A total of ten healthy subjects performed two separate experiments while walking on an instrumented treadmill.	Semantic Scholar
The whole-body kinematics were recorded using a motion-capture system, and the ground reaction forces were measured by the force plates embedded in the treadmill.	Semantic Scholar
We found no significant differences in the kinematic gait parameters of healthy subjects when the downward force, equivalent to 15% body weight, applied by the TPAD was replaced by a weighted pelvic belt having 15% body weight.	Semantic Scholar
However, the activation of the gastrocnemius muscle and the estimated maximum ankle torque, predicted by an inverted pendulum mathematical model, during the single support phase of walking, showed a higher increase with the weight belt when compared to a pure downward force.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, the weight belt, because of its simplicity, must be further considered as a more convenient candidate to translate the results of TPAD in children with cerebral palsy who suffer from crouch gait.	Semantic Scholar

We address in this letter the problem of loop closure detection for laser-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) of very large areas.	Semantic Scholar
Consistent with the state of the art, the map is encoded as a graph of poses, and to cope with very large mapping capabilities, loop closures are asserted by comparing the features extracted from a query laser scan against a previously acquired corpus of scan features using a bag-of-words (BoW) scheme.	Semantic Scholar
Two contributions are here presented.	Semantic Scholar
First, to benefit from the graph topology, feature frequency scores in the BoW are computed not only for each individual scan but also from neighboring scans in the SLAM graph.	Semantic Scholar
This has the effect of enforcing neighbor relational information during document matching.	Semantic Scholar
Second, a weak geometric check that takes into account feature ordering and occlusions is introduced that substantially improves loop closure detection performance.	Semantic Scholar
The two contributions are evaluated both separately and jointly on four common SLAM datasets and are shown to improve the state-of-the-art performance both in terms of precision and recall in most of the cases.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, our current implementation is designed to work at nearly frame rate, allowing loop closure query resolution at nearly 22  Hz for the best case scenario and 2  Hz for the worst case scenario.	Semantic Scholar

Writer identification is an important topic for pattern recognition and artificial intelligence.	Semantic Scholar
Traditional methods rely heavily on sophisticated hand-crafted features to represent the characteristics of different writers.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework for online text-independent writer identification by using a recurrent neural network (RNN).	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, the handwriting data of a particular writer are represented by a set of random hybrid strokes (RHSs).	Semantic Scholar
Each RHS is a randomly sampled short sequence representing pen tip movements ( $xy$-coordinates) and pen-down or pen-up states.	Semantic Scholar
RHS is independent of the content and language involved in handwriting; therefore, writer identification at the RHS level is more general and convenient than the character level or the word level, which also requires character/word segmentation.	Semantic Scholar
The RNN model with bidirectional long short-term memory is used to encode each RHS into a fixed-length vector for final classification.	Semantic Scholar
All the RHSs of a writer are classified independently, and then, the posterior probabilities are averaged to make the final decision.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed framework is end-to-end and does not require any domain knowledge for handwriting data analysis.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on both English (133 writers) and Chinese (186 writers) databases verify the advantages of our method compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, the H∞ state estimation problem is investigated for a class of uncertain discrete-time neural networks subject to infinitely distributed delays and fading channels.	Semantic Scholar
Randomly occurring uncertainties (ROUs) are introduced to reflect the random nature of the network condition fluctuations, and the channel fading phenomenon is considered to account for the possibly unreliable network medium on which the measurement signal is transmitted.	Semantic Scholar
A set of Bernoulli-distributed white sequences are employed to govern the ROUs and the L-th Rice fading model is utilized where channel coefficients are mutually independent random variables with certain probability density function on [0,1].	Semantic Scholar
We aim to design a state estimator such that the dynamics of the estimation error is asymptotically stable while satisfying the prescribed H∞ performance constraint.	Semantic Scholar
By adopting the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and the stochastic analysis theory, sufficient conditions are established to ensure the existence of the desired state estimators and the explicit expression of such estimators is acquired.	Semantic Scholar
A simulation example is provided to verify the usefulness of the proposed approach.	Semantic Scholar
Database access logs are the starting point for many forms of database administration, from database performance tuning, to security auditing, to benchmark design, and many more.	Semantic Scholar
Unfortunately, query logs are also large and unwieldy, and it can be difficult for an analyst to extract broad patterns from the set of queries found therein.	Semantic Scholar
Clustering is a natural first step towards understanding the massive query logs.	Semantic Scholar
However, many clustering methods rely on the notion of pairwise similarity, which is challenging to compute for SQL queries, especially when the underlying data and database schema is unavailable.	Semantic Scholar
We investigate the problem of computing similarity between queries, relying only on the query structure.	Semantic Scholar
We conduct a rigorous evaluation of three query similarity heuristics proposed in the literature applied to query clustering on multiple query log datasets, representing different types of query workloads.	Semantic Scholar
To improve the accuracy of the three heuristics, we propose a generic feature engineering strategy, using classical query rewrites to standardize query structure.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed strategy results in a significant improvement in the performance of all three similarity heuristics.	Semantic Scholar
We show that Langevin Markov chain Monte Carlo inference in an energy-based model with latent variables has the property that the early steps of inference, starting from a stationary point, correspond to propagating error gradients into internal layers, similar to backpropagation.	Semantic Scholar
The backpropagated error is with respect to output units that have received an outside driving force pushing them away from the stationary point.	Semantic Scholar
Backpropagated error gradients correspond to temporal derivatives with respect to the activation of hidden units.	Semantic Scholar
These lead to a weight update proportional to the product of the presynaptic firing rate and the temporal rate of change of the postsynaptic firing rate.	Semantic Scholar
Simulations and a theoretical argument suggest that this rate-based update rule is consistent with those associated with spike-timing-dependent plasticity.	Semantic Scholar
The ideas presented in this article could be an element of a theory for explaining how brains perform credit assignment in deep hierarchies as efficiently as backpropagation does, with neural computation corresponding to both approximate inference in continuous-valued latent variables and error backpropagation, at the same time.	Semantic Scholar
We consider an inhomogeneous small-world network (SWN) composed of inhibitory short-range (SR) and long-range (LR) interneurons, and investigate the effect of network architecture on emergence of synchronized brain rhythms by varying the fraction of LR interneurons plong.	Semantic Scholar
The betweenness centralities of the LR and SR interneurons (characterizing the potentiality in controlling communication between other interneurons) are distinctly different.	Semantic Scholar
"Hence, in view of the betweenness, SWNs we consider are inhomogeneous, unlike the ""canonical"" Watts-Strogatz SWN with nearly the same betweenness centralities."	Semantic Scholar
For small plong, the load of communication traffic is much concentrated on a few LR interneurons.	Semantic Scholar
However, as plong is increased, the number of LR connections (coming from LR interneurons) increases, and then the load of communication traffic is less concentrated on LR interneurons, which leads to better efficiency of global communication between interneurons.	Semantic Scholar
Sparsely synchronized rhythms are thus found to emerge when passing a small critical value plong(c)(≃0.16).	Semantic Scholar
The population frequency of the sparsely synchronized rhythm is ultrafast (higher than 100 Hz), while the mean firing rate of individual interneurons is much lower (∼30 Hz) due to stochastic and intermittent neural discharges.	Semantic Scholar
These dynamical behaviors in the inhomogeneous SWN are also compared with those in the homogeneous Watts-Strogatz SWN, in connection with their network topologies.	Semantic Scholar
Particularly, we note that the main difference between the two types of SWNs lies in the distribution of betweenness centralities.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike the case of the Watts-Strogatz SWN, dynamical responses to external stimuli vary depending on the type of stimulated interneurons in the inhomogeneous SWN.	Semantic Scholar
We consider two cases of external time-periodic stimuli applied to sub-populations of the LR and SR interneurons, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
Dynamical responses (such as synchronization suppression and enhancement) to these two cases of stimuli are studied and discussed in relation to the betweenness centralities of stimulated interneurons, representing the effectiveness for transfer of stimulation effect in the whole network.

With the robots tending to accumulate more and more capabilities beyond the level of acting in a deterministic fashion, the idea of introducing them into our every day lives seems to be closer now.	Semantic Scholar
Robotics systems and techniques appeared during the recent years have achieved astonishing potential to perceive and interpret their surrounding not only as low level features but also close to human understandable concepts.	Semantic Scholar
Such advances, in conjunction with the aspiration to incorporate robots into domestic or public places, led to the flourishing of fields dealing with their response in human presence.	Semantic Scholar
Following this notion, the field of social mapping was recently introduced in order to manage the shared space among robots and individuals in an ordinary fashion.	Semantic Scholar
This manuscript aims to systemize the recent literature by describing the required levels of robot perception, focusing on methods related to robot’s social awareness, the availability of datasets these methods can be compared with, as well as issues that remain open and need to be confronted when robots operate in close proximity with humans.

"PURPOSE
The organization of neural networks and the mechanisms, which generate the highly stereotypical for absence epilepsy spike-wave discharges (SWDs) is heavily debated."	Semantic Scholar
Here we describe such a model which can both reproduce the characteristics of SWDs and dynamics of coupling between brain regions, relying mainly on properties of hierarchically organized networks of a large number of neuronal oscillators.	Semantic Scholar
"MODEL
We used a two level mesoscale model."	Semantic Scholar
The first level consists of three structures: the nervus trigeminus serving as an input, the thalamus and the somatosensory cortex; the second level of a group of nearby situated neurons belonging to one of three modeled structures.	Semantic Scholar
"RESULTS
The model reproduces the main features of the transition from normal to epileptiformic activity and its spontaneous abortion: an increase in the oscillation amplitude, the emergence of the main frequency and its higher harmonics, and the ability to generate trains of seizures."	Semantic Scholar
The model was stable with respect to variations in the structure of couplings and to scaling.	Semantic Scholar
The analyzes of the interactions between model structures from their time series using Granger causality method showed that the model reproduced the preictal coupling increase detected previously from experimental data.	Semantic Scholar
"CONCLUSION
SWDs can be generated by changes in network organization."	Semantic Scholar
It is proposed that a specific pathological architecture of couplings in the brain is necessary to allow the transition from normal to epileptiformic activity, next to by others modeled and reported factors referring to complex, intrinsic, and synaptic mechanisms.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, action proposal methods have played an important role in action recognition tasks, as they reduce the search space dramatically.	Semantic Scholar
Most unsupervised action proposal methods tend to generate hundreds of action proposals which include many noisy, inconsistent, and unranked action proposals, while supervised action proposal methods take advantage of predefined object detectors (e.g., human detector) to refine and score the action proposals, but they require thousands of manual annotations to train.	Semantic Scholar
Given the action proposals in a video, the goal of the proposed work is to generate a few better action proposals that are ranked properly.	Semantic Scholar
In our approach, we first divide action proposal into sub-proposal and then use Dynamic Programming based graph optimization scheme to select the optimal combinations of sub-proposals from different proposals and assign each new proposal a score.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a new unsupervised image-based actioness detector that leverages web images and employ it as one of the node scores in our graph formulation.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we capture motion information by estimating the number of motion contours within each action proposal patch.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method is an unsupervised method that neither needs bounding box annotations nor video level labels, which is desirable with the current explosion of large-scale action datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach is generic and does not depend on a specific action proposal method.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our approach on several publicly available trimmed and un-trimmed datasets and obtain better performance compared to several proposal ranking methods.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we demonstrate that properly ranked proposals Preprint submitted to Computer Vision and Image Understanding April 3, 2017 produce significantly better action detection as compared to state-of-the-art proposal based methods.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a three-dimensional (3-D) visual detection method for the challenging task of detecting peduncles of sweet peppers (Capsicum annuum) in the field.	Semantic Scholar
Cutting the peduncle cleanly is one of the most difficult stages of the harvesting process, where the peduncle is the part of the crop that attaches it to the main stem of the plant.	Semantic Scholar
Accurate peduncle detection in 3-D space is, therefore, a vital step in reliable autonomous harvesting of sweet peppers, as this can lead to precise cutting while avoiding damage to the surrounding plant.	Semantic Scholar
This letter makes use of both color and geometry information acquired from an RGB-D sensor and utilizes a supervised-learning approach for the peduncle detection task.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated and evaluated by using qualitative and quantitative results [the area-under-the-curve (AUC) of the detection precision-recall curve].	Semantic Scholar
We are able to achieve an AUC of 0.71 for peduncle detection on field-grown sweet peppers.	Semantic Scholar
We release a set of manually annotated 3-D sweet pepper and peduncle images to assist the research community in performing further research on this topic.	Semantic Scholar
A new type of parallel robot mechanism with an extendable structure is presented, and its kinematic properties and design parameters are analyzed.	Semantic Scholar
The triple scissor extender (TSE) is a six-degree-of-freedom robotic mechanism for reaching high ceilings and positioning an end effector.	Semantic Scholar
Three scissor mechanisms are arranged in parallel, with the bottom ends coupled to linear slides, and the top vertex attached to an end effector plate.	Semantic Scholar
Arbitrary positions and orientations of the end effector can be achieved through the coordinated motion of the six linear actuators located at the base.	Semantic Scholar
By changing key geometric parameters, the TSE's design can yield a specific desired workspace volume and differential motion behavior.	Semantic Scholar
A general kinematic model for diverse TSEs is derived, and the kinematic properties, including workspace, singularity, and the Jacobian singular values, are evaluated.	Semantic Scholar
From these expressions, four key design parameters are identified, and their sensitivity upon the workspace volume and the Jacobian singular values is analyzed.A case study in autonomous aircraft assembly is presented using the insights gained from the design parameter studies.	Semantic Scholar
We present a single trajectory optimization formulation for legged locomotion that automatically determines the gait sequence, step timings, footholds, swing-leg motions, and six-dimensional body motion over nonflat terrain, without any additional modules.	Semantic Scholar
Our phase-based parameterization of feet motion and forces allows to optimize over the discrete gait sequence using only continuous decision variables.	Semantic Scholar
The system is represented using a simplified centroidal dynamics model that is influenced by the feet's location and forces.	Semantic Scholar
We explicitly enforce friction cone constraints, depending on the shape of the terrain.	Semantic Scholar
The nonlinear programming problem solver generates highly dynamic motion plans with full flight phases for a variety of legged systems with arbitrary morphologies in an efficient manner.	Semantic Scholar
We validate the feasibility of the generated plans in simulation and on the real quadruped robot ANYmal.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, the entire solver software TOWR, which used to generate these motions is made freely available.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental constraints have traditionally implied separate studies of different cortical functions, such as memory and sensory-motor control.	Semantic Scholar
Yet certain cortical modalities, while repeatedly observed and reported, have not been clearly identified with one cortical function or another.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, while neuronal membrane and synapse polarities with respect to a certain potential value have been attracting considerable interest in recent years, the purposes of such polarities have largely remained a subject for speculation and debate.	Semantic Scholar
Formally identifying these polarities as on-off neuronal polarity gates, we analytically show that cortical circuit structure, behavior, and memory are all governed by the combined potent effect of these gates, which we collectively term circuit polarity.	Semantic Scholar
Employing widely accepted and biologically validated firing rate and plasticity paradigms, we show that circuit polarity is mathematically embedded in the corresponding models.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we show that the firing rate dynamics implied by these models are driven by ongoing circuit polarity gating dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, circuit polarity is shown to segregate cortical circuits into internally synchronous, externally asynchronous subcircuits, defining their firing rate modes in accordance with different cortical tasks.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to the Hebbian paradigm, which is shown to be susceptible to mutual neuronal interference in the face of asynchrony, circuit polarity is shown to block such interference.	Semantic Scholar
Noting convergence of synaptic weights, we show that circuit polarity holds the key to cortical memory, having a segregated capacity linear in the number of neurons.	Semantic Scholar
While memory concealment is implied by complete neuronal silencing, memory is restored by reactivating the original circuit polarity.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we show that incomplete deterioration or restoration of circuit polarity results in memory modification, which may be associated with partial or false recall, or novel innovation.	Semantic Scholar

In many complex time-critical tasks such as financial trading, cyber security monitoring, and patient monitoring in critical care, external interruptions and multiple-task situations disrupt the flow of tasks performed by operators leading to errors and accidents.	Semantic Scholar
There is an abundance of work reported on interruptions, which informs system designers and researchers on the potential cost of interruptions at different points within a task.	Semantic Scholar
However, a gap exists in our understanding of the relationship between interruption disruptiveness and the predictability of events that require an operator's response.	Semantic Scholar
To understand this better, we conducted an experiment involving 22 participants and a financial trading task.	Semantic Scholar
The experiment involved two levels of predictability (low and high) and two levels of task load (low and high).	Semantic Scholar
The experiment showed that task load had an overall negative effect on events.	Semantic Scholar
The results also showed that interruptions negatively affected responses to predictable events.	Semantic Scholar
However, we found that interruptions did not affect responses to unpredictable events.	Semantic Scholar
Overall, our research suggests that to leverage the role of predictability, the goal-activation model should be used to determine the impact of various design options about visual cues and predictable-trend durations.	Semantic Scholar
The research also reveals that unpredictable events may be cognitively different from predictable events when understanding the influence of interruptions on work, suggesting that interruption management tools may need to treat the situational context (predictable or unpredictable) differently, in providing a supportive workflow for the management of interruptions.

In many applications, top-k dominating query is an important operation to return k tuples with the highest domination scores in a potentially huge data space.	Semantic Scholar
It is analyzed that the existing algorithms have their performance problems when performed on massive data.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a novel table-scan-based TDTS algorithm to efficiently compute top-k dominating results.	Semantic Scholar
TDTS first presorts the table for early termination.	Semantic Scholar
The early termination checking is proposed in this paper, along with the theoretical analysis of scan depth.	Semantic Scholar
The pruning operation for tuples is devised in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
The theoretical pruning effect shows that the number of tuples maintained in TDTS can be reduced substantially.	Semantic Scholar
The extensive experimental results, conducted on synthetic and real-life data sets, show that TDTS outperforms the existing algorithms significantly.	Semantic Scholar
Three new image-based visual-impedance control laws are proposed in this letter allowing physical interaction of a dual-arm unmanned aerial manipulator equipped with a camera and a force/torque sensor.	Semantic Scholar
Namely, two first-order impedance behaviors are designed based on the transpose and the inverse of the system Jacobian matrix, respectively, while a second-order impedance behavior is carried out as well.	Semantic Scholar
Visual information is employed both to coordinate the camera motion in an eye-in-hand configuration with the assigned task executed by the other robot arm, and to define the elastic wrench component of the proposed hybrid impedance equations directly in the image plane.	Semantic Scholar

Behavior trees (BTs) are a way of organizing the switching structure of a hybrid dynamical system (HDS), which was originally introduced in the computer game programming community.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we analyze how the BT representation increases the modularity of an HDS and how key system properties are preserved over compositions of such systems, in terms of combining two BTs into a larger one.	Semantic Scholar
We also show how BTs can be seen as a generalization of sequential behavior compositions, the subsumption architecture, and decisions trees.	Semantic Scholar
These three tools are powerful but quite different, and the fact that they are unified in a natural way in BTs might be a reason for their popularity in the gaming community.	Semantic Scholar
We conclude the paper by giving a set of examples illustrating how the proposed analysis tools can be applied to robot control BTs.	Semantic Scholar
Service robots are expected to play an important role in our daily lives as our companions in home and work environments in the near future.	Semantic Scholar
An important requirement for fulfilling this expectation is to equip robots with skills to perform everyday manipulation tasks, the success of which is crucial for most home chores, such as cooking, cleaning, and shopping.	Semantic Scholar
Robots have been used successfully for manipulation tasks in wellstructured and controlled factory environments for decades.	Semantic Scholar
Designing skills for robots working in uncontrolled human environments raises many potential challenges in various subdisciplines, such as computer vision, automated planning, and human-robot interaction.	Semantic Scholar
In spite of the recent progress in these fields, there are still challenges to tackle.	Semantic Scholar
This article outlines problems in different research areas related to mobile manipulation from the cognitive perspective, reviews recently published works and the state-of-the-art approaches to address these problems, and discusses open problems to be solved to realize robot assistants that can be used in manipulation tasks in unstructured human environments.

In this paper, we propose a data structure, a quadruple neighbor list (QN-list, for short), to support real time queries of all <underline>l</underline>ongest <underline>i</underline>ncreasing <underline>s</underline>ubsequence (LIS) and LIS with constraints over sequential data streams.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to support both LIS enumeration and LIS with constraints computation by using a single uniform data structure for real time sequential data streams.	Semantic Scholar
Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both time and space cost, not only theoretically, but also empirically.	Semantic Scholar
Here we present a novel, histogram-based salient point feature detector that may naturally be applied to both images and 3D data.	Semantic Scholar
Existing point feature detectors are often modality specific, with 2D and 3D feature detectors typically constructed in separate ways.	Semantic Scholar
As such, their applicability in a 2D-3D context is very limited, particularly where the 3D data is obtained by a LiDAR scanner.	Semantic Scholar
By contrast, our histogram-based approach is highly generalisable and as such, may be meaningfully applied between 2D and 3D data.	Semantic Scholar
Using the generalised approach, we propose salient point detectors for images, and both untextured and textured 3D data.	Semantic Scholar
The approach naturally allows for the detection of salient 3D points based jointly on both the geometry and texture of the scene, allowing for broader applicability.	Semantic Scholar
The repeatability of the feature detectors is evaluated using a range of datasets including image and LiDAR input from indoor and outdoor scenes.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in terms of 2D-2D and 2D-3D repeatability compared to existing multi-modal feature detectors.	Semantic Scholar
Most robot mapping techniques for lidar sensors tessellate the environment into pixels or voxels and assume uniformity of the environment within them.	Semantic Scholar
Although intuitive, this representation entails disadvantages: The resulting grid maps exhibit aliasing effects and are not differentiable.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we address these drawbacks by introducing a novel mapping technique that neither relies on tessellation nor on the assumption of piecewise uniformity of the space, without increasing memory requirements.	Semantic Scholar
Instead of representing the map in the position domain, we store the map parameters in the discrete frequency domain and leverage the continuous extension of the inverse discrete cosine transform to convert them to a continuously differentiable scalar field in the position domain, which we call DCT map.	Semantic Scholar
A DCT map assigns to each point in space a lidar decay rate, which models the local permeability of the space for laser rays.	Semantic Scholar
In this way, the map can describe objects of different laser permeabilities, from completely opaque to completely transparent.	Semantic Scholar
DCT maps represent lidar measurements significantly more accurate than grid maps, Gaussian process occupancy maps, and Hilbert maps, all with the same memory requirements, as demonstrated in our real-world experiments.	Semantic Scholar
We investigate the problem of automatically determining what type of shoe left an impression found at a crime scene.	Semantic Scholar
This recognition problem is made difficult by the variability in types of crime scene evidence (ranging from traces of dust or oil on hard surfaces to impressions made in soil) and the lack of comprehensive databases of shoe outsole tread patterns.	Semantic Scholar
We find that mid-level features extracted by pre-trained convolutional neural nets are surprisingly effective descriptors for this specialized domains.	Semantic Scholar
However, the choice of similarity measure for matching exemplars to a query image is essential to good performance.	Semantic Scholar
For matching multi-channel deep features, we propose the use of multi-channel normalized cross-correlation and analyze its effectiveness.	Semantic Scholar
Our proposed metric significantly improves performance in matching crime scene shoeprints to laboratory test impressions.	Semantic Scholar
We also show its effectiveness in other cross-domain image retrieval problems: matching facade images to segmentation labels and aerial photos to map images.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we introduce a discriminatively trained variant and fine-tune our system through our proposed metric, obtaining state-of-the-art performance.	Semantic Scholar
A multitude of contemporary applications heavily involve graph data whose size appears to be ever–increasing.	Semantic Scholar
This trend shows no signs of subsiding and has caused the emergence of a number of distributed graph processing systems including Pregel, Apache Giraph, and GraphX .	Semantic Scholar
However, the unprecedented scale now reached by real-world graphs hardens the task of graph processing due to excessive memory demands even for distributed environments.	Semantic Scholar
By and large, such contemporary graph processing systems employ ineffective in-memory representations of adjacency lists.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, memory usage patterns emerge as a primary concern in distributed graph processing.	Semantic Scholar
We seek to address this challenge by exploiting empirically-observed properties demonstrated by graphs generated by human activity.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose 1) three compressed adjacency list representations that can be applied to any distributed graph processing system, 2) a variable-byte encoded representation of out-edge weights for space-efficient support of weighted graphs, and 3) a tree-based compact out-edge representation that allows for efficient mutations on the graph elements.	Semantic Scholar
We experiment with publicly-available graphs whose size reaches two-billion edges and report our findings in terms of both space-efficiency and execution time.	Semantic Scholar
Our suggested compact representations do reduce respective memory requirements for accommodating the graph elements up–to 5 times if compared with state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
At the same time, our memory-optimized methods retain the efficiency of uncompressed structures and enable the execution of algorithms for large scale graphs in settings where contemporary alternative structures fail due to memory errors.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a cost-effective motion-planning method for robots operating in complex and realistic environments.	Semantic Scholar
While sampling-based path-planning algorithms, such as a rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) and its variants, have been highly effective for general path-planning problems, it is still difficult to find the minimum cost path in a complex space efficiently since RRT-based algorithms extend a search tree locally, requiring a large number of samples before finding a good solution.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents an efficient nonmyopic path-planning algorithm by combining RRT* and a stochastic optimization method, called cross entropy.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method constructs two RRT trees: The first tree is a standard RRT* tree, which is used to determine the nearest node in the tree to be extended to a randomly chosen point, and the second tree contains the first tree with additional long extensions.	Semantic Scholar
By maintaining two separate trees, we can grow the search tree nonmyopically to improve the efficiency of the algorithm while ensuring the asymptotic optimality of RRT*.	Semantic Scholar
From an extensive set of simulations and experiments using mobile and humanoid robots, we demonstrate that the proposed method consistently finds low-cost paths faster than the existing algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
The aim of this paper is to develop a general framework for training neural networks (NNs) in a distributed environment, where training data is partitioned over a set of agents that communicate with each other through a sparse, possibly time-varying, connectivity pattern.	Semantic Scholar
In such distributed scenario, the training problem can be formulated as the (regularized) optimization of a non-convex social cost function, given by the sum of local (non-convex) costs, where each agent contributes with a single error term defined with respect to its local dataset.	Semantic Scholar
To devise a flexible and efficient solution, we customize a recently proposed framework for non-convex optimization over networks, which hinges on a (primal) convexification-decomposition technique to handle non-convexity, and a dynamic consensus procedure to diffuse information among the agents.	Semantic Scholar
Several typical choices for the training criterion (e.g., squared loss, cross entropy, etc.)	Semantic Scholar
and regularization (e.g., ℓ2 norm, sparsity inducing penalties, etc.)	Semantic Scholar
are included in the framework and explored along the paper.	Semantic Scholar
Convergence to a stationary solution of the social non-convex problem is guaranteed under mild assumptions.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, we show a principled way allowing each agent to exploit a possible multi-core architecture (e.g., a local cloud) in order to parallelize its local optimization step, resulting in strategies that are both distributed (across the agents) and parallel (inside each agent) in nature.	Semantic Scholar
A comprehensive set of experimental results validate the proposed approach.	Semantic Scholar
Search result diversification aims to retrieve diverse results to satisfy as many different information needs as possible.	Semantic Scholar
Supervised methods have been proposed recently to learn ranking functions and they have been shown to produce superior results to unsupervised methods.	Semantic Scholar
However, these methods use implicit approaches based on the principle of Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR).	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a learning framework for explicit result diversification where subtopics are explicitly modeled.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the information contained in the sequence of selected documents, we use the attention mechanism to capture the subtopics to be focused on while selecting the next document, which naturally fits our task of document selection for diversification.	Semantic Scholar
As a preliminary attempt, we employ recurrent neural networks and max pooling to instantiate the framework.	Semantic Scholar
We use both distributed representations and traditional relevance features to model documents in the implementation.	Semantic Scholar
The framework is flexible to model query intent in either a flat list or a hierarchy.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms all the existing search result diversification approaches.	Semantic Scholar
Because of the limited reflected energy and incoming illumination in an individual band, the reflected energy captured by a hyperspectral sensor might be low and there is inevitable noise that significantly decreases the performance of the subsequent analysis.	Semantic Scholar
Denoising is therefore of first importance in hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis and interpretation.	Semantic Scholar
However, most HSI denoising methods remove noise with the important spectral information being severely distorted.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents an HSI denoising method using trainable spectral difference learning with spatial initialization (called HDnTSDL) aimed at preserving the spectral information.	Semantic Scholar
In the proposed HDnTSDL model, a key band is automatically selected and denoised.	Semantic Scholar
The denoised key band acts as a starting point to reconstruct the rest of the non-key bands.	Semantic Scholar
Meanwhile, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with trainable non-linearity functions is proposed to learn the spectral difference mapping.	Semantic Scholar
Then, the rest of the non-key bands are denoised under the guidance of the learned spectral difference with the key band as a starting point.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments have been conducted on five databases with both indoor and outdoor scenes.	Semantic Scholar
Comparative analyses validate that the proposed method: (i) presents superior performance in spatial recovery and spectral preservation, and (ii) requires less computational time than state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
Spherical cameras are widely used due to their full 360$^\circ$  fields of view.	Semantic Scholar
However, a common but severe problem is that anything carrying the camera is always included in the view, occluding visual information.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a novel method to remove such occlusions in videos taken from a freely moving spherical camera.	Semantic Scholar
Our method can recover the occluded background accurately in distorted spherical videos by inpainting the color and motion information of pixels.	Semantic Scholar
The missing color and motion information inside the occluded region is iteratively recovered in a coarse-to-fine optimization.	Semantic Scholar
Spatial and temporal coherence of color and motion information is enforced, considering spherical image geometry.	Semantic Scholar
Initially, feature-point matching is used to remove the effect of camera rotation in order to deal with large pixel displacements.	Semantic Scholar
Following this, the iterative optimization process is bootstrapped using a reliable estimate of motion information obtained by interpolating it from surrounding regions.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate its effectiveness by successfully completing videos and recovering occluded regions recorded in various practical situations and by quantifying it against other state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
Mobile robots (MRs) using wireless communications often experience small-scale fading so that the wireless channel gain can be low.	Semantic Scholar
If the channel gain is poor (due to fading), the robot can move (a small distance) to another location to improve the channel gain and so compensate for fading.	Semantic Scholar
Techniques using this principle are called mobility diversity algorithms (MDAs).	Semantic Scholar
MDAs intelligently explore a number of points to find a location with high channel gain while using little mechanical energy during the exploration.	Semantic Scholar
Until now, the location of these points has been predetermined.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we show how we can adapt their positions by using channel predictors.	Semantic Scholar
Our results show that MDAs, which adapt the location of those points, can in fact outperform (in terms of the channel gain obtained and mechanical energy used) the MDAs that use predetermined locations for those points.	Semantic Scholar
These results will significantly improve the performance of the MDAs and consequently allow MRs to mitigate poor wireless channel conditions in an energy-efficient manner.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a tree-structured structure-from-motion (SfM) method that recovers 3D scene structures and estimates camera poses from unordered image sets.	Semantic Scholar
Starting from atomic structures spanning the scene, we build well-connected structure groups, and propose RANSAC generalized Procrustes analysis (RGPA) to glue structures in the same group.	Semantic Scholar
The grouping-aligning operations hierarchically proceed until the full scene is reconstructed.	Semantic Scholar
Our work is the first attempt of using GPA for modern 3D reconstruction tasks.	Semantic Scholar
RGPA is able to merge multiple structures at a time and automatically identify outliers.	Semantic Scholar
The reconstruction tree is much more compact and balanced than previous hierarchical SfM methods and has a very shallow depth.	Semantic Scholar
These advantages, along with the resulting removal of intermediate bundle adjustments, lead to significantly improved computational efficiency over state-of-the-art SfM methods.	Semantic Scholar
The cameras and 3D scene can be robustly recovered in the presence of moderate noise.	Semantic Scholar
We verify the efficacy of our method on a variety of datasets, and demonstrate that our method is able to produce metric reconstructions efficiently and robustly.	Semantic Scholar

Low-Rank Representation (LRR) is arguably one of the most powerful paradigms for Multi-view spectral clustering, which elegantly encodes the multi-view local graph/manifold structures into an intrinsic low-rank self-expressive data similarity embedded in high-dimensional space, to yield a better graph partition than their single-view counterparts.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we revisit it with a fundamentally different perspective by discovering LRR as essentially a latent clustered orthogonal projection based representation winged with an optimized local graph structure for spectral clustering; each column of the representation is fundamentally a cluster basis orthogonal to others to indicate its members, which intuitively projects the view-specific feature representation to be the one spanned by all orthogonal basis to characterize the cluster structures.	Semantic Scholar
Upon this finding, we propose our technique with the following: (1) We decompose LRR into latent clustered orthogonal representation via low-rank matrix factorization, to encode the more flexible cluster structures than LRR over primal data objects; (2) We convert the problem of LRR into that of simultaneously learning orthogonal clustered representation and optimized local graph structure for each view; (3) The learned orthogonal clustered representations and local graph structures enjoy the same magnitude for multi-view, so that the ideal multi-view consensus can be readily achieved.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments over multi-view datasets validate its superiority, especially over recent state-of-the-art LRR models.	Semantic Scholar
In recent years, wearability has become a new fundamental requirement for an effective and lightweight design of human-robot interfaces.	Semantic Scholar
Among the different application fields, robotic teleoperation represents the ideal scenario that can largely benefit from wearability to reduce constraints to the human workspace (acting as a master) and enable an intuitive and simplified information exchange within the teleoperator system.	Semantic Scholar
This effective simplification is particularly important if we consider the interaction with synergy-inspired robotic devices, i.e., those that are endowed with a reduced number of control inputs and sensors, with the goal of simplifying control and communication among humans and robots.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we present an integrated approach for augmented teleoperation where wearable hand/arm pose undersensing and haptic feedback devices are combined with teleimpedance (TI) techniques for the simplified yet effective position and stiffness control of a synergy-inspired robotic manipulator in real time.	Semantic Scholar
The slave robot consists of a KUKA lightweight robotic arm equipped with the Pisa/IIT SoftHand, both controlled in impedance to perform a drilling task-an illustrative example of a dynamic task with environmental constraints.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results from ten healthy subjects suggest that the proposed integrated interface enables the master to appropriately regulate the stiffness and pose of the robotic hand-arm system through the perception of interaction forces and vision, contributing to successful and intuitive executions of the remote task.

The achieved performance is presented in comparison to the reduced versions of the integrated system, in which either TI control or wearable feedback is excluded.	Semantic Scholar

the target of the campaign.	Semantic Scholar
Our main hypothesis is that if we learn seeds that are not only capable of influencing but also are linked to more diverse (groups of) users, then the influence triggers will be diversified as well, and hence the target users will get higher chance of being engaged.	Semantic Scholar
Upon this intuition, we define a novel problem, named <italic>Diversity-sensitive Targeted Influence Maximization (DTIM)</italic>, which assumes to model user diversity by exploiting only topological information within a social graph.	Semantic Scholar
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to bring the concept of topology-driven diversity into targeted IM problems, for which we define two alternative definitions.	Semantic Scholar
"Accordingly, we propose approximate solutions of DTIM, which detect a size- <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""tagarelli-ieq1-2820010.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> set of users that maximizes the diversity-sensitive capital objective function, for a given selection of target users."	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our DTIM methods on a special case of user engagement in online social networks, which concerns users who are not actively involved in the community life.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental evaluation on real networks has demonstrated the meaningfulness of our approach, also highlighting the opportunity of further development of solutions for DTIM applications.	Semantic Scholar
Mutual information is a commonly used measure of communication between neurons, but little theory exists describing the relationship between mutual information and the parameters of the underlying neuronal interaction.	Semantic Scholar
Such a theory could help us understand how specific physiological changes affect the capacity of neurons to synaptically communicate, and, in particular, they could help us characterize the mechanisms by which neuronal dynamics gate the flow of information in the brain.	Semantic Scholar
Here we study a pair of linear-nonlinear-Poisson neurons coupled by a weak synapse.	Semantic Scholar
We derive an analytical expression describing the mutual information between their spike trains in terms of synapse strength, neuronal activation function, the time course of postsynaptic currents, and the time course of the background input received by the two neurons.	Semantic Scholar
This expression allows mutual information calculations that would otherwise be computationally intractable.	Semantic Scholar
We use this expression to analytically explore the interaction of excitation, information transmission, and the convexity of the activation function.	Semantic Scholar
Then, using this expression to quantify mutual information in simulations, we illustrate the information-gating effects of neural oscillations and oscillatory coherence, which may either increase or decrease the mutual information across the synapse depending on parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we show analytically that our results can quantitatively describe the selection of one information pathway over another when multiple sending neurons project weakly to a single receiving neuron.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we open new perspectives for mathematical expression recognition by introducing an original bimodal system.	Semantic Scholar
Since handwritten mathematical expression recognition is a very challenging task prone to many ambiguities, we use speech as an additional modality to circumvent limitations that are inherent to the written form.	Semantic Scholar
A use case scenario corresponds to lectures given in classrooms where the teacher would write and read aloud any mathematical expressions to allow a better interpretation.	Semantic Scholar
In addition to state-of-the-art solutions for recognizing handwriting and speech, we introduce a multilayer architecture for the merger of modalities.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, the Dempster–Shafer theory is used to process the information at the symbol level.	Semantic Scholar
This bimodal system is evaluated on real bimodal data, the HAMEX dataset.	Semantic Scholar
Large improvements are observed when speech and handwriting are combined when compared to the single handwriting modality.	Semantic Scholar

The ability to anticipate a fall is fundamental for any robot that has to balance.	Semantic Scholar
Currently, fast fall-prediction algorithms only exist for simple models, such as the linear inverted pendulum model (LIPM), whose validity breaks down in multicontact scenarios (i.e., when contacts are not limited to a flat ground).	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a fast fall-prediction algorithm based on the point-mass model, which remains valid in multicontact scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
The key assumption of our algorithm is that, in order to come to a stop without changing its contacts, a robot only needs to accelerate its center of mass in the direction opposite to its velocity.	Semantic Scholar
This assumption allows us to predict the fall by means of a convex optimal control problem, which we solve with a fast custom algorithm (less than 11 ms of computation time).	Semantic Scholar
We validated the approach through extensive simulations with the humanoid robot HRP-2 in randomly-sampled scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
Comparisons with standard LIPM-based methods demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm in predicting the fall of the robot, when controlled with a state-of-the-art balance controller.	Semantic Scholar

The Bayesian model of confidence posits that confidence reflects the observer's posterior probability that the decision is correct.	Semantic Scholar
Hangya, Sanders, and Kepecs (2016) have proposed that researchers can test the Bayesian model by deriving qualitative signatures of Bayesian confidence (i.e., patterns that one would expect to see if an observer were Bayesian) and looking for those signatures in human or animal data.	Semantic Scholar
We examine two proposed signatures, showing that their derivations contain hidden assumptions that limit their applicability and that they are neither necessary nor sufficient conditions for Bayesian confidence.	Semantic Scholar
One signature is an average confidence of 0.75 on trials with neutral evidence.	Semantic Scholar
This signature holds only when class-conditioned stimulus distributions do not overlap and when internal noise is very low.	Semantic Scholar
Another signature is that as stimulus magnitude increases, confidence increases on correct trials but decreases on incorrect trials.	Semantic Scholar
This divergence signature holds only when stimulus distributions do not overlap or when noise is high.	Semantic Scholar
Navajas et al.	Semantic Scholar
(2017) have proposed an alternative form of this signature; we find no indication that this alternative form is expected under Bayesian confidence.	Semantic Scholar

This letter presents a novel wearable haptic controller (WHC) system suitable for teleoperation of demolition machines and robotic platforms.	Semantic Scholar
With regard to existing operator controller unit composed by passive joysticks, the WHC has been designed to provide force feedback to the user, hence improving the user performance during the teleoperation of different robotic platforms and the interaction with the environment on the remote construction sites.	Semantic Scholar
The haptic feedback is provided through two compact parallel kinematic (CPK) interfaces that will be presented within the paper.	Semantic Scholar
The CPK implements a novel variant of the Delta kinematics which allows minimizing the radial encumbrance while preserving same operational workspace.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we propose a new interaction modality that provides users the feeling of directly maneuvering the end-effector of the demolition machine.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the architecture of the proposed system is presented and the results of some preliminary evaluation tests are discussed.	Semantic Scholar

We consider the Watts-Strogatz small-world network (SWN) consisting of subthreshold neurons which exhibit noise-induced spikings.	Semantic Scholar
This neuronal network has adaptive dynamic synaptic strengths governed by the spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP).	Semantic Scholar
In previous works without STDP, stochastic spike synchronization (SSS) between noise-induced spikings of subthreshold neurons was found to occur in a range of intermediate noise intensities.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we investigate the effect of additive STDP on the SSS by varying the noise intensity.	Semantic Scholar
"Occurrence of a ""Matthew"" effect in synaptic plasticity is found due to a positive feedback process."	Semantic Scholar
As a result, good synchronization gets better via long-term potentiation of synaptic strengths, while bad synchronization gets worse via long-term depression.	Semantic Scholar
Emergences of long-term potentiation and long-term depression of synaptic strengths are intensively investigated via microscopic studies based on the pair-correlations between the pre- and the post-synaptic IISRs (instantaneous individual spike rates) as well as the distributions of time delays between the pre- and the post-synaptic spike times.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the effects of multiplicative STDP (which depends on states) on the SSS are studied and discussed in comparison with the case of additive STDP (independent of states).	Semantic Scholar
These effects of STDP on the SSS in the SWN are also compared with those in the regular lattice and the random graph.	Semantic Scholar
We present a novel natural user interface framework, called Meta-Gesture, for selecting and manipulating rotatable virtual reality (VR) objects in egocentric viewpoint.	Semantic Scholar
Meta-Gesture uses the gestures of holding and manipulating the tools of daily use.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, the holding gesture is used to summon a virtual object into the palm, and the manipulating gesture to trigger the function of the summoned virtual tool.	Semantic Scholar
Our contributions are broadly threefold: 1) Meta-Gesture is the first to perform bare hand-gesture-based orientation-aware selection and manipulation of very small (nail-sized) VR objects, which has become possible by combining a stable 3-D palm pose estimator (publicly available) with the proposed static-dynamic (SD) gesture estimator; 2) the proposed novel SD random forest, as an SD gesture estimator can classify a 3-D static gesture and its action status hierarchically, in a single classifier; and 3) our novel voxel coding scheme, called layered shape pattern, which is configured by calculating the fill rate of point clouds (raw source of data) in each voxel on the top of the palm pose estimation, allows for dispensing with the need for preceding hand skeletal tracking or joint classification while defining a gesture.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that the proposed method can deliver promising performance, even under frequent occlusions, during orientation-aware selection and manipulation of objects in VR space by wearing head-mounted display with an attached egocentric-depth camera (see the supplementary video available at: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org).

Then, the bag of contour fragment descriptors are extracted from the three depth projection maps and concatenated as a final shape representation of the original depth data.	Semantic Scholar
A support vector machine with a linear kernel is used as a shape classifier.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed description method is evaluated on three public datasets, as well as a new and more challenging dataset for hand gesture recognition.	Semantic Scholar
Results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the previous methods on all tested datasets for both static digit recognition and letter gesture recognition.	Semantic Scholar
For the challenging HUST-ASL dataset, in particular, the proposed method improves on the previous state-of-the-art methods from 40.1% to 64.6%.	Semantic Scholar

Given a reachability problem in a rewrite theory, this calculus can compute any normalized answer that can be checked by rewriting, or a more general one that can be instantiated to that answer.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we focus on extracting a parametrization of asymmetrical bimanual tasks from human demonstration.	Semantic Scholar
Two arms coordinate while being in physical contact and fulfilling complementary aspects of the task: one arm is mostly assistive while the other performs active manipulation.	Semantic Scholar
Such a task can be executed either autonomously by a bimanual robot, or collaboratively by a single robotic arm performing the assistive or active role in collaboration with a human.	Semantic Scholar
We thus decompose the demonstrated task in a set of actions and for each action we extract: the role of the arms as master or slave, the type of coupling as force–motion or motion–motion coupling with the corresponding stiffness modulation, and the transition condition.	Semantic Scholar
We discuss how this applies to the three execution cases mentioned above.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally for the collaborative case we study hand–related features that allow the robot to anticipate and adapt to the user’s actions.	Semantic Scholar
We validate our approach on common daily tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Concentric tube manipulators exhibit elastic instability in which tubes snap from one configuration to another, rapidly releasing stored strain energy.	Semantic Scholar
While this has long been viewed as a negative phenomenon to be avoided at all costs, in this letter, we explore for the first time whether the effect can be harnessed beneficially for certain applications.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we show that the energy released in an instability can be useful for challenging high-force surgical tasks such as driving a needle through tissue.	Semantic Scholar
We use concentric tube models to define the energy released during elastic instability and experimentally evaluate a two-tube concentric manipulator that can drive suture needles through tissue by harnessing elastic instability beneficially.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we consider the binary transfer learning problem, focusing on how to select and combine sources from a large pool to yield a good performance on a target task.	Semantic Scholar
Constraining our scenario to real world, we do not assume the direct access to the source data, but rather we employ the source hypotheses trained from them.	Semantic Scholar
We propose an efficient algorithm that selects relevant source hypotheses and feature dimensions simultaneously, building on the literature on the best subset selection problem.	Semantic Scholar
Our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results on three computer vision datasets, substantially outperforming both transfer learning and popular feature selection baselines in a small-sample setting.	Semantic Scholar
We also present a randomized variant that achieves the same results with the computational cost independent from the number of source hypotheses and feature dimensions.	Semantic Scholar
Also, we theoretically prove that, under reasonable assumptions on the source hypotheses, our algorithm can learn effectively from few examples.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we explore the different minimal case solutions to the rotational alignment of IMU-camera systems using homography constraints.	Semantic Scholar
The assumption that a ground plane is visible in the images can easily be created in many situations.	Semantic Scholar
This calibration process is relevant to many smart devices equipped with a camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU), like micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), smartphones and tablets, and it is a fundamental step for vision and IMU data fusion.	Semantic Scholar
Our solutions are novel as they compute the rotational alignment of IMU-camera systems by utilizing a first-order rotation approximation and by solving a polynomial equation system derived from homography constraints.	Semantic Scholar
These solutions depend on the calibration case with respect to camera motion (general motion case or pure rotation case) and camera parameters (calibrated camera or partially uncalibrated camera).	Semantic Scholar
We then demonstrate that the number of matched points in an image pair can vary from 1.5 to 3.	Semantic Scholar
This enables us to calibrate using only one relative movement and provide the exact algebraic solution to the problem.	Semantic Scholar
The novel minimal case solutions are useful to reduce the computation time and increase the calibration robustness when using Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) on the point correspondences between two images.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, a non-linear parameter optimization over all image pairs is performed.	Semantic Scholar

Palpation is a key diagnostic aid for physicians when looking for tissue abnormalities.	Semantic Scholar
This letter focuses on autonomous robotic palpation for locating regions of interest representing possible tumor locations or underlying anatomy (e.g., a hidden artery).	Semantic Scholar
Many approaches direct the robot to exhaustively palpate the entire organ.	Semantic Scholar
To reduce exploration time, we define a utility function to guide the search to palpate likely regions of interest and update this function as the new palpation data are collected.	Semantic Scholar
The search approach, presented in this letter, incorporates prior information from preoperative images, which can provide an estimate for the location of suspicious sites, thereby reducing unnecessary manipulation and exploration of the organ.	Semantic Scholar
To generate search trajectories that encode a coverage goal and locate all regions of interest, two planners are adapted.	Semantic Scholar
The first planner is based on ergodic coverage and the second planner is based on Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA).	Semantic Scholar
Both planners are evaluated via simulation and experimentally to elucidate their strengths and weaknesses.	Semantic Scholar
The results demonstrate a higher efficacy of the BOA planner in detecting all regions of interest while avoiding exhaustive palpation scan of the organ.	Semantic Scholar

However, their control with neuromuscular interfacing remains challenging.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, existing myocontrol interfaces typically require an extensive calibration.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a minimally supervised, online myocontrol system for proportional and simultaneous finger force estimation based on ridge regression using only individual finger tasks for training.	Semantic Scholar
We compare the performance of this system when using two feature sets extracted from high-density electromyography (EMG) recordings: EMG linear envelope (ENV) and non-linear EMG to muscle activation mapping (ACT).	Semantic Scholar
Eight intact-limb participants were tested using online target reaching tasks.	Semantic Scholar
On average, the subjects hit 85% ± 9% and 91% ± 11% of single finger targets with ENV and ACT features, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
The hit rate for combined finger targets decreased to 29% ± 16% (ENV) and 53% ± 23% (ACT).	Semantic Scholar
The non-linear transformation (ACT) therefore improved the performance, leading to higher completion rate and more stable control, especially for the non-trained movement classes (better generalization).	Semantic Scholar
These results demonstrate the feasibility of proportional multiple finger control in intact subjects by regression on non-linear EMG features with a minimal training set of single finger tasks.	Semantic Scholar

Most camera images are saved as 8-bit standard RGB (sRGB) compressed JPEGs.	Semantic Scholar
Even when JPEG compression is set to its highest quality, the encoded sRGB image has been significantly processed in terms of color and tone manipulation.	Semantic Scholar
This makes sRGB–JPEG images undesirable for many computer vision tasks that assume a direct relationship between pixel values and incoming light.	Semantic Scholar
For such applications, the RAW image format is preferred, as RAW represents a minimally processed, sensor-specific RGB image that is linear with respect to scene radiance.	Semantic Scholar
The drawback with RAW images, however, is that they require large amounts of storage and are not well-supported by many imaging applications.	Semantic Scholar
To address this issue, we present a method to encode the necessary data within an sRGB–JPEG image to reconstruct a high-quality RAW image.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach requires no calibration of the camera’s colorimetric properties and can reconstruct the original RAW to within 0.5% error with a small memory overhead for the additional data (e.g., 128 KB).	Semantic Scholar
More importantly, our output is a fully self-contained 100% compliant sRGB–JPEG file that can be used as-is, not affecting any existing image workflow—the RAW image data can be extracted when needed, or ignored otherwise.	Semantic Scholar
We detail our approach and show its effectiveness against competing strategies.	Semantic Scholar

First, the method utilizes the information of edge curvature to split curves into arcs.	Semantic Scholar
Next, the arc convexity–concavity is used to classify arcs into different quadrants of ellipses.	Semantic Scholar

Place recognition plays an important role to perform loop closure detection of large-scale, long-term simultaneous localization and mapping in loopy environments.	Semantic Scholar
The long-term place recognition problem is challenging because the environment appearance exhibits significant long-term variations across various times of the day, months, and seasons.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we introduce a novel place representation approach that simultaneously integrates semantic landmarks and holistic information to achieve place recognition in long-term autonomy.	Semantic Scholar
First, a graph is constructed for each place.	Semantic Scholar
The graph nodes encode all landmarks and the holistic image of the place scene recorded in different scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
The edges connecting the nodes indicate that these nodes represent the same landmark or place, even though places and landmarks encoded by the nodes may exhibit different appearances in the long-term periods.	Semantic Scholar
Then, a graph embedding is learned to preserve the locality in the feature descriptor space, i.e., finding a projection such that the same landmark and place have the identical representation in the new projected descriptor space, no matter in what scenarios they are recorded.	Semantic Scholar
We formulate the embedding learning as an optimization problem and implement a new solver that provides a theoretical convergence guarantee.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive evaluations are conducted using large-scale benchmark datasets of place recognition in long-term autonomy, which has shown our approach's promising performance.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents an experimental evaluation of an in-vehicle eco-driving support system that provided auditory, visual, and vibrotactile stimuli for the discouragement of harsh accelerations, and to encourage maximization of the duration of the coasting phase of the vehicle.	Semantic Scholar
Behavior when driving normally was compared to that exhibited when participants were asked to drive economically, and to that exhibited when provided with feedback in the three sensory modes, individually and in all combinations thereof.	Semantic Scholar
Results suggest that participants were already aware that harsh accelerations are to be avoided when eco-driving; however, additional eco-driving support, particularly that which involved the auditory and haptic modalities, further discouraged these behaviors.	Semantic Scholar
The eco-driving information also supported significantly greater coasting distances (when approaching slowing events), a behavior not spontaneously produced by participants when asked to drive economically.	Semantic Scholar
Few differences were seen between the effects of the different modes and combinations; however, results taken together suggest that visual-only information may be less effective at encouraging compliance across all participants.	Semantic Scholar
The auditory stimulus, although it encouraged compliance, was not well received by participants.	Semantic Scholar

Pose graph optimization consists in the estimation of a set of poses from pairwise measurements and provides a formalization for many problems arising in mobile robotics and geometric computer vision.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we consider two-dimensional pose estimation problems in which a subset of the measurements is spurious.	Semantic Scholar
Our first contribution is to develop robust estimators that can cope with heavy-tailed measurement noise, hence increasing robustness to the presence of outliers.	Semantic Scholar
Since the resulting estimators require solving nonconvex optimization problems, we further develop convex relaxations that approximately solve those problems via semidefinite programming.	Semantic Scholar
We then provide conditions for testing the exactness of the proposed relaxations.	Semantic Scholar
Contrary to existing approaches, our convex relaxations do not rely on the availability of an initial guess for the unknown poses, hence they are more suitable for setups in which such guess is not available (e.g., multirobot localization, recovery after localization failure).	Semantic Scholar
We tested the proposed techniques in extensive simulations, and we show that some of the proposed relaxations are indeed tight (i.e., they solve the original nonconvex problem exactly) and ensure accurate estimation in the face of a large number of outliers.	Semantic Scholar
Judgment analysis (JA) is a technique for modeling and interpreting human judgments that is usually based on multiple linear regression.	Semantic Scholar
However, the linear assumptions inherent to this approach can be limiting for modeling both the human judgments and the environmental criterion.	Semantic Scholar

We describe our LAMSTAR network JA process and use it to analyze data from an air traffic control conflict prediction task.	Semantic Scholar
These results are compared with those of a traditional regression-based lens model analysis.	Semantic Scholar
We found that the LAMSTAR-based JA did a better job of capturing human judgment, while the regression-based model was more appropriate for the criterion.	Semantic Scholar
This suggest that the LAMSTAR-based JA approach has utility when human judgments are not well represented by a linear model.	Semantic Scholar
We discuss our results with respect to both the specific application we evaluated as well as meta-analyses of the JA literature.	Semantic Scholar
We also explore avenues for future research.	Semantic Scholar
This paper considers the problem of the asymptotic synchronization in mean square for stochastic reaction-diffusion complex dynamical networks with infinite delay driven by the Wiener processes in the infinite dimensional space under the pinning impulsive control.	Semantic Scholar
Two types of the impulsive controllers are proposed: the first is a single pinning impulsive controller on the first node, and the second is the pinning impulsive controller on a small portion of the network nodes.	Semantic Scholar
By using the variation-of-constant formula and the fixed point theorem, the asymptotic behavior of impulsive differential equations with infinite delay is first analyzed.	Semantic Scholar
Then, by introducing some operators in the abstract space, the networks are transformed into a set of stochastic coupled impulsive partial differential equations in Hilbert space.	Semantic Scholar
Under these two pinning impulsive control types, the asymptotic stability in mean square of stochastic coupled partial differential equations is examined by Lyapunov function approach and the comparison principle.	Semantic Scholar
The asymptotic synchronization in mean square of stochastic reaction-diffusion dynamical networks can be realized for these two pinning impulsive control schemes.	Semantic Scholar
One example is provided to present the potential application of the theoretic results obtained.	Semantic Scholar
The recent successes in many visual recognition tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation can be attributed in large part to three factors: (i) advances in end-to-end trainable deep learning models (LeCun 2015), (ii) the progress of computing hardware, and (iii) the introduction of increasingly larger labeled datasets such as PASCAL VOC (Everingham et al.

The result is a hybrid system driven by symbolic inputs that are mapped onto paths, realizing desired mixing levels.	Semantic Scholar
Controllers derived from optimal control provide theoretical bounds on the achievable amount of mixing, satisfaction of spatio-temporal constraints, and collision-free trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
Designs are carried to implementation on real robot platforms.	Semantic Scholar
In several multirobot applications in which communication is limited, the mission could require the robots to iteratively take coordinated joint decisions on how to spread out in the environment and on how to reconnect with each other to share data and compute plans.	Semantic Scholar
Exploration and surveillance are examples of these applications.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we consider the problem of computing robots’ paths on a graph-represented environment for restoring connections at minimum traveling cost.	Semantic Scholar
We call it the multirobot reconnection problem, we show its NP-hardness and hardness of approximation on some important classes of graphs, and we provide optimal and heuristic algorithms to solve it in practical settings.	Semantic Scholar
The techniques we propose are then exploited to derive a new efficient planning algorithm for a relevant connectivity-constrained multirobot planning problem addressed in the literature, the multirobot informative path planning with periodic connectivity problem.	Semantic Scholar
Conventional Chinese calligraphy robots often suffer from the limited sizes of predefined font databases, which prevent the robots from writing new characters.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a robotic handwriting system to address such limitations, which extracts Chinese characters from textbooks and uses a robot's manipulator to write the characters in a different style.	Semantic Scholar
The key technologies of the proposed approach include the following: 1) automatically decomposing Chinese characters into strokes using Harris corner detection technology and 2) matching the decomposed strokes to robotic writing trajectories learned from human gestures.	Semantic Scholar
Briefly, the system first decomposes a given Chinese character into a set of strokes and obtains the stroke trajectory writing ability by following the gestures performed by a human demonstrator.	Semantic Scholar
Then, it applies a stroke classification method that recognizes the decomposed strokes as robotic writing trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the robot arm is driven to follow the trajectories and thus write the Chinese character.	Semantic Scholar
Seven common Chinese characters have been used in an experiment for system validation and evaluation.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results demonstrate the power of the proposed system, given that the robot successfully wrote all the testing characters in the given Chinese calligraphic style.	Semantic Scholar
This letter makes scientific and methodological contributions.	Semantic Scholar
Scientifically, it demonstrates a new and behaviorally relevant effect of temporal expectation on the phase coherence of the electroencephalogram (EEG).	Semantic Scholar
Methodologically, it introduces novel methods to characterize EEG recordings at the single-trial level.	Semantic Scholar
Expecting events in time can lead to more efficient behavior.	Semantic Scholar
A remarkable finding in the study of temporal expectation is the foreperiod effect on reaction time, that is, the influence on reaction time of the delay between a warning signal and a succeeding imperative stimulus to which subjects are instructed to respond as quickly as possible.	Semantic Scholar
Here we study a new foreperiod effect in an audiovisual attention-shifting oddball task in which attention-shift cues directed the attention of subjects to impendent deviant stimuli of a given modality and therefore acted as warning signals for these deviants.	Semantic Scholar
Standard stimuli, to which subjects did not respond, were interspersed between warning signals and deviants.	Semantic Scholar
We hypothesized that foreperiod durations modulated intertrial phase coherence (ITPC, the degree of phase alignment across multiple trials) evoked by behaviorally irrelevant standards and that these modulations are behaviorally meaningful.	Semantic Scholar
Using averaged data, we first observed that ITPC evoked by standards closer to the warning signal was significantly different from that evoked by standards further away from it, establishing a new foreperiod effect on ITPC evoked by standards.	Semantic Scholar
We call this effect the standard foreperiod (SFP) effect on ITPC.	Semantic Scholar
We reasoned that if the SFP influences ITPC evoked by standards, it should be possible to decode the former from the latter on a trial-by-trial basis.	Semantic Scholar
We were able to do so showing that this effect can be observed in single trials.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrated the behavioral relevance of the SFP effect on ITPC by showing significant correlations between its strength and subjects' behavioral performance.	Semantic Scholar

These were subjected to the usual review process of IJCV, and resulted in nine selected papers.	Semantic Scholar
The papers present a snapshot of some the best work in computer visionwhich reached fruition in the Spring of 2016, and cover a diverse set of topics.	Semantic Scholar
Several topics deserve note.	Semantic Scholar
As with most recent conferences in the area, there was keen interest in Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks.	Semantic Scholar
Analysing people and their faces remains a pressing topic, with application in interfaces and biometrics.	Semantic Scholar

Learning semantics based on context information has been researched in many research areas for decades.	Semantic Scholar
Context information can not only be directly used as the input data, but also sometimes used as auxiliary knowledge to improve existing models.	Semantic Scholar
This survey aims at providing a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on context learning.	Semantic Scholar
We summarize and group the existing literature into four categories, Explicit Analysis, Implicit Analysis, Neural Network Models, and Composite Models, based on the underlying techniques adopted by them.	Semantic Scholar
For each category, we talk about the basic idea and techniques, and also introduce how context information is utilized as the model input or incorporated into the model to enhance the performance or extend the domain of application as auxiliary knowledge.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each model from both the technical and practical point of view.	Semantic Scholar
In one-class classification problems, only the data for the target class is available, whereas the data for the non-target class may be completely absent.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study one-class nearest neighbor (OCNN) classifiers and their different variants.	Semantic Scholar
We present a theoretical analysis to show the relationships among different variants of OCNN that may use different neighbors or thresholds to identify unseen examples of the non-target class.	Semantic Scholar
We also present a method based on inter-quartile range for optimizing parameters used in OCNN in the absence of non-target data during training.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we propose two ensemble approaches based on random subspace and random projection methods to create accurate OCNN ensembles.	Semantic Scholar
We tested the proposed methods on 15 benchmark and real world domain-specific datasets and show that random-projection ensembles of OCNN perform best.	Semantic Scholar
Lost productivity from lower back injuries in workplaces costs billions of U.S. dollars per year.	Semantic Scholar
A significant fraction of such workplace injuries are the result of workers not following best practices.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel computer-vision-based system that aims to increase the workers’ compliance to best practices.	Semantic Scholar
The system consists of inexpensive programmable depth sensors, wearable devices, and smart phones.	Semantic Scholar
The system is designed to track the activities of consented workers using the depth sensors, alert them discreetly on detection of noncompliant activities, and produce cumulative reports on their performance.	Semantic Scholar
Essentially, the system provides a valuable set of services for both workers and administrators toward a healthier and, therefore, more productive workplace.	Semantic Scholar
This study advances the state of the art in the following ways: 1) a set of mechanisms that enable nonintrusive privacy-aware selective tracking of consented workers in the presence of people that should not be tracked; 2) a single sign-on worker identification mechanism; 3) a method that provides realtime detection of noncompliant activities; and 4) a usability study that provides invaluable feedback regarding system design and deployment, as well as future areas of improvements.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a method to generate an order for learning and transferring motor skills based on motion complexity, then evaluate the order to learn motor skills of a task and transfer them to another task as a form of reinforcement learning (RL).	Semantic Scholar
Here, motion complexity refers to the complexity calculated from multiple motion trajectories of a task.	Semantic Scholar
To do this, multiple human demonstrations are extracted and clustered to calculate motion complexity and identify the motor skills involved in a task.	Semantic Scholar
The motion trajectories of the task are then used to calculate the motion complexity considering temporal entropy and spatial entropy.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, both orders [Simple-to-Complex] and [Complex-to-Simple] are generated to learn and transfer motor skills based on the motion complexities of multiple tasks.	Semantic Scholar
To evaluate these orders, two tasks [Drawing] and [Fitting] are performed using an actual robotic arm.	Semantic Scholar
To verify the learning and transfer processes, we apply our method to three different figures as well as to pegs and holes of three different shapes and analyze the experimental results.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we provide guidelines for using the [Simple-to-Complex] and [Complex-to-Simple] orders in RL.	Semantic Scholar

Despite the rapid advances in soft robotic actuation technologies, the main energy source that powers most wearable systems remains the conventional tethered stationary air compressor that greatly limits these systems’ applicability.	Semantic Scholar
Several portable pneumatic energy sources have been introduced; however, the limited maximum output pressure and flow rate, size and weight, large operational noise, and potential safety hazards must still be resolved before being applied to current wearable applications.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we propose the design of a portable double-piston crank microcompressor that can generate up to a maximum gauge output pressure of 986 kPa and a maximum flow rate of 9.78 L/min, while maintaining a simple structure, static mass of 1.5 kg and not generating any safety hazards.	Semantic Scholar
The design requirements in terms of maximum pressure and flow rate were optimized based on wearable robotic applications.	Semantic Scholar
The sound intensity level generated by the developed microcompressor was approximately 65 dB, which can be used for long-term usage, at maximum flow rate when measured from a 0.5 m distance.	Semantic Scholar
The Surgical Robot Challenge, now in its third year, has its foundation in years of effort from people across the globe.	Semantic Scholar
While there are countless people and organizations that have made it possible, this article walks through the history of four building blocks that have played a key part in its formation.	Semantic Scholar
A measure of local fault tolerance for kinematically redundant robots has previously been defined based on the properties of the singular values of the Jacobian matrix.	Semantic Scholar
Based on these measures, one can determine a Jacobian that is optimal.	Semantic Scholar
Because these measures are solely based on the singular values of the Jacobian, permutation of the columns does not affect the optimality.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, when one generates a kinematic robot design from this optimal Jacobian, there will be 7!	Semantic Scholar
robot designs with the same locally optimal fault tolerant property.	Semantic Scholar
The work described here shows how to analyze and organize the kinematic structure of these 7!	Semantic Scholar
designs in terms of their Denavit and Hartenberg (DH) parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, global fault tolerant measures are defined in order to evaluate the different designs.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown that robot designs that are very similar in terms of DH parameters, e.g., robots generated from Jacobians where the columns are in reverse order, can have very different global properties.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, a computationally efficient approach to calculate the global pre- and post-failure dexterity measures is presented and used to identify two Pareto optimal robot designs.	Semantic Scholar
The workspaces for these optimal designs are also shown.	Semantic Scholar
We present a contact invariant trajectory optimization formulation to synthesize motions for legged robotic systems.	Semantic Scholar
The method is capable of finding optimal trajectories subject to whole-body dynamics with hard contacts.	Semantic Scholar
Contact switches are determined automatically.	Semantic Scholar
We make use of concepts from bilevel optimization to find gradients of the system dynamics including the constraint forces and subsequently solve the optimal control problem with the unconstrained iLQR algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Our formulation achieves fast computation times and scales well with the number of contact points.	Semantic Scholar
The physical correctness of the produced trajectories is verified through experiments in simulation and on real hardware.	Semantic Scholar
We showcase our method on a single-legged hopper for which jumping and forward hopping motions are synthesized with an arbitrary number of contact switches.	Semantic Scholar
The jumping trajectories can be tracked on the robot and allow it to safely liftoff and land.	Semantic Scholar
We suggest a novel algorithm that tracks given shapes in real time from a low-quality video stream.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm is based on a careful selection of a small subset of pixels that suffices to obtain an approximation of the observed shape.	Semantic Scholar
The shape can then be extracted quickly from the small subset.	Semantic Scholar
We implemented the algorithm in a system for mutual localization of a group of low-cost toy-quadcopters.	Semantic Scholar
Each quadcopter carries only a single 8-g RGB camera, and stabilizes itself via real-time tracking of the other quadcopters in  $\sim30$ frames/s.	Semantic Scholar
Existing algorithms for real-time shape fitting are based on more expensive hardware, external cameras, or have significantly worse performance.	Semantic Scholar
We provide full open source to our algorithm, experimental results, benchmarks, and video that demonstrates our system.	Semantic Scholar
We then discuss generalizations to other shapes and extensions for more robotics applications.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a mathematical model of figure-ground articulation that takes into account both local and global gestalt laws and is compatible with the functional architecture of the primary visual cortex (V1).	Semantic Scholar
The local gestalt law of good continuation is described by means of suitable connectivity kernels that are derived from Lie group theory and quantitatively compared with long-range connectivity in V1.	Semantic Scholar
Global gestalt constraints are then introduced in terms of spectral analysis of a connectivity matrix derived from these kernels.	Semantic Scholar
This analysis performs grouping of local features and individuates perceptual units with the highest salience.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical simulations are performed, and results are obtained by applying the technique to a number of stimuli.	Semantic Scholar
Reliable execution of robot manipulation actions in cluttered environments requires that the robot is able to understand relations between objects and reason about consequences of actions applied to these objects.	Semantic Scholar
We present an approach for extracting physically plausible support relations between objects based on visual information, which does not require any prior knowledge about physical object properties, e.g., mass distribution or friction coefficients.	Semantic Scholar
Based on a scene representation enriched by such physically plausible support relations between objects, we derive predictions about action effects.	Semantic Scholar
These predictions take into account uncertainty about support relations and allow applying strategies for safe bimanual object manipulation when needed.	Semantic Scholar
The extraction of physically plausible support relations is evaluated both in simulation and in real-world experiments using real data from a depth camera, whereas the handling of support relation uncertainties is validated on the humanoid robot ARMAR-III.	Semantic Scholar
Passivity has been a major criterion for designing a stable haptic interface due to its numerous advantages.	Semantic Scholar
However, passivity-based controllers have suffered from the design conservatism of the passivity criterion, particularly when users want to increase the maximum apparent impedance.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the input-to-state stable (ISS) criterion and an analogy between haptic interfaces and systems with hysteresis, this paper proposes a control framework that is less conservative than passivity-based controllers.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed ISS approach allows a non-predetermined finite amount of output energy to be extracted from the system.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, the proposed method can increase the maximum apparent impedance compared with passivity-based approaches.	Semantic Scholar
The focus of this paper is on how the proposed approach is designed to satisfy the input-to-state stability criterion in real time without prior knowledge of the system.	Semantic Scholar
This paper also extends the primary single-port ISS approach to a two-port ISS approach for multiple-degree-of-freedom generalization.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed ISS approach is able to stabilize a higher impedance range than the time-domain passivity approach.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results also confirm that the proposed approach provides higher actual apparent impedance to the operator compared with the energy-bounding and force-bounding approaches.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel robotic platform for aerial operation and manipulation, a spherically connected multiquadrotor (SmQ) platform, which consists of a rigid frame and multiple quadrotors that are connected to the frame via passive spherical joints and act as distributed rotating thrust generators to collectively propel the frame by adjusting their attitude and thrust force.	Semantic Scholar
Depending on the number of quadrotors and their configuration, this SmQ platform can fully (or partially) overcome the issues of underactuation of the standard multirotor drones for aerial operation/manipulation (e.g., body-tilting with sideway gust/force, dynamic interaction hard to attain, complicated arm–drone integration, etc.).	Semantic Scholar
We present the dynamics modeling of this SmQ platform system and establish the condition for its full actuation in SE(3).	Semantic Scholar
We also show how to address limited range of spherical joints and rotor saturations as a constrained optimization problem by noticing the similarity with the multifingered grasping problem under the friction-cone constraint.	Semantic Scholar
We then design and analyze feedback control laws for the S3Q and S2Q systems as a combination of high-level Lyapunov control design and low-level constrained optimization and show that the (fully actuated) S3Q system can assume any trajectory in SE(3), whereas the S2Q system in  $\Re^3\, \times$ S $^2$ with its unactuated dynamics is still internally stable.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments are also performed to show the efficacy of the theory.	Semantic Scholar
Recently exploring locally connected subgraphs (also known as motifs or graphlets) of complex networks attracts a lot of attention.	Semantic Scholar
Previous work made the strong assumption that the graph topology of interest is known in advance.	Semantic Scholar
In practice, sometimes researchers have to deal with the situation where the graph topology is unknown because it is expensive to collect and store all topological information.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, typically what is available to researchers is only a snapshot of the graph, i.e., a subgraph of the graph.	Semantic Scholar
Crawling methods such as breadth first sampling can be used to generate the snapshot.	Semantic Scholar
However, these methods fail to sample a streaming graph represented as a high speed stream of edges.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, graph mining applications such as network traffic monitoring usually use random edge sampling (i.e., sample each edge with a fixed probability) to collect edges and generate a sampled graph, which we call a “ RESampled graph”.	Semantic Scholar
Clearly, a RESampled graph's motif statistics may be quite different from those of the original graph.	Semantic Scholar
To resolve this, we propose a framework Minfer, which takes the given RESampled graph and accurately infers the underlying graph's motif statistics.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments using large scale datasets show the accuracy and efficiency of our method.	Semantic Scholar
Real-world networks feature weights of interactions, where link weights often represent some physical attributes.	Semantic Scholar
In many situations, to recover the missing data or predict the network evolution, we need to predict link weights in a network.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we first proposed a series of new centrality indices for links in line graph.	Semantic Scholar
Then, utilizing these line graph indices, as well as a number of original graph indices, we designed three supervised learning methods to realize link weight prediction both in the networks of single layer and multiple layers, which perform much better than several recently proposed baseline methods.	Semantic Scholar
We found that the resource allocation index (RA) plays a more important role in the weight prediction than other topological properties, and the line graph indices are at least as important as the original graph indices in link weight prediction.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the success application of our methods on Yelp layered network suggests that we can indeed predict the offline co-foraging behaviors of users just based on their online social interactions, which may open a new direction for link weight prediction algorithms, and meanwhile provide insights to design better restaurant recommendation systems.	Semantic Scholar
Monocular visual odometry (VO) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have seen tremendous improvements in accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, and have gained increasing popularity over recent years.	Semantic Scholar
Nevertheless, not so many discussions have been carried out to reveal the influences of three very influential yet easily overlooked aspects, such as photometric calibration, motion bias, and rolling shutter effect.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we evaluate these three aspects quantitatively on the state of the art of direct, feature-based, and semi-direct methods, providing the community with useful practical knowledge both for better applying existing methods and developing new algorithms of VO and SLAM.	Semantic Scholar
Conclusions (some of which are counterintuitive) are drawn with both technical and empirical analyses to all of our experiments.	Semantic Scholar
Possible improvements on existing methods are directed or proposed, such as a subpixel accuracy refinement of oriented fast and rotated brief (ORB)-SLAM, which boosts its performance.	Semantic Scholar
This study focuses on predicting stock closing prices by using recurrent neural networks (RNNs).	Semantic Scholar
A long short-term memory (LSTM) model, a type of RNN coupled with stock basic trading data and technical indicators, is introduced as a novel method to predict the closing price of the stock market.	Semantic Scholar
We realize dimension reduction for the technical indicators by conducting principal component analysis (PCA).	Semantic Scholar
To train the model, some optimization strategies are followed, including adaptive moment estimation (Adam) and Glorot uniform initialization.	Semantic Scholar
Case studies are conducted on Standard & Poor's 500, NASDAQ, and Apple (AAPL).	Semantic Scholar
Plenty of comparison experiments are performed using a series of evaluation criteria to evaluate this model.	Semantic Scholar
Accurate prediction of stock market is considered an extremely challenging task because of the noisy environment and high volatility associated with the external factors.	Semantic Scholar
We hope the methodology we propose advances the research for analyzing and predicting stock time series.	Semantic Scholar

All the necessary key equations for the frontal plane coupled dynamics are presented along with the human feedback law derived from the proposed state normalization in length and time.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we pay special attention to how the natural frequency of each system influences the resulting motion and analyze how the coupled system responds to various robot sizes.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments in which a human operator controls a simulated bipedal robot show how the Balance Feedback Interface force varies according to different scales and responds to external disturbances.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we show the method's robustness to uneven terrain and how we can allow the point feet robot to synchronously take steps with the operator.	Semantic Scholar
This is an introductory study that aims to grant legged robots motor capabilities for power manipulation comparable to humans.	Semantic Scholar
We present a decentralized ergodic control policy for time-varying area coverage problems for multiple agents with nonlinear dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
Ergodic control allows us to specify distributions as objectives for area coverage problems for nonlinear robotic systems as a closed-form controller.	Semantic Scholar
We derive a variation to the ergodic control policy that can be used with consensus to enable a fully decentralized multiagent control policy.	Semantic Scholar
Examples are presented to illustrate the applicability of our method for multiagent terrain mapping as well as target localization.	Semantic Scholar
An analysis on ergodic policies as a Nash equilibrium is provided for game theoretic applications.	Semantic Scholar

Nonlinear system modeling plays an important role in practical engineering, and deep learning-based deep belief network (DBN) is now popular in nonlinear system modeling and identification because of the strong learning ability.	Semantic Scholar
However, the existing weights optimization for DBN is based on gradient, which always leads to a local optimum and a poor training result.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a DBN with partial least square regression (PLSR-DBN) is proposed for nonlinear system modeling, which focuses on the problem of weights optimization for DBN using PLSR.	Semantic Scholar
Firstly, unsupervised contrastive divergence (CD) algorithm is used in weights initialization.	Semantic Scholar
Secondly, initial weights derived from CD algorithm are optimized through layer-by-layer PLSR modeling from top layer to bottom layer.	Semantic Scholar
Instead of gradient method, PLSR-DBN can determine the optimal weights using several PLSR models, so that a better performance of PLSR-DBN is achieved.	Semantic Scholar
Then, the analysis of convergence is theoretically given to guarantee the effectiveness of the proposed PLSR-DBN model.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the proposed PLSR-DBN is tested on two benchmark nonlinear systems and an actual wastewater treatment system as well as a handwritten digit recognition (nonlinear mapping and modeling) with high-dimension input data.	Semantic Scholar
The experiment results show that the proposed PLSR-DBN has better performances of time and accuracy on nonlinear system modeling than that of other methods.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a hypergraph-based framework for modeling and detecting malevolent activities.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed model supports the specification of order-independent sets of action symbols along with temporal and cardinality constraints on the execution of actions.	Semantic Scholar
We study and characterize the problems of consistency checking, equivalence, and minimality of hypergraph-based models.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we define and characterize the general activity detection problem, that amounts to finding all subsequences that represent a malevolent activity in a sequence of logged actions.	Semantic Scholar
Since the problem is intractable, we also develop an index data structure that allows the security expert to efficiently extract occurrences of activities of interest.	Semantic Scholar
The retrieval function is one of the most important components of an Information Retrieval (IR) system, because it determines to what extent some information is relevant to a user query.	Semantic Scholar
Most retrieval functions have “free parameters” whose value must be set before retrieval, significantly affecting the effectiveness of an IR system.	Semantic Scholar
Choosing the optimum values for such parameters is therefore of paramount importance.	Semantic Scholar
However, the optimum can only be found after a computationally expensive process, especially when the generalization error is estimated via cross-validation.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose to determine free parameter values by solving an optimization problem aimed at maximizing a measure of retrieval effectiveness.	Semantic Scholar
We employ the black-box optimization paradigm, since the analytical expression of the measure of effectiveness with respect to the free parameters is unknown.	Semantic Scholar
We consider different methods for solving the black-box optimization problem: a simple grid-search over the whole domain, and more sophisticated techniques such as line search and surrogate model based algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on several test collections not only provide useful insight about effectiveness, but also about efficiency: they indicate that with appropriate optimization techniques, the computational cost of parameter optimization can be greatly reduced without compromising retrieval effectiveness, even when taking generalization into account.	Semantic Scholar
Computer vision and robotics are being increasingly applied in medical interventions.	Semantic Scholar
Especially in interventions where extreme precision is required, they could make a difference.	Semantic Scholar
One such application is robot-assisted retinal microsurgery.	Semantic Scholar
In recent works, such interventions are conducted under a stereo-microscope, and with a robot-controlled surgical tool.	Semantic Scholar
The complementarity of computer vision and robotics has, however, not yet been fully exploited.	Semantic Scholar
In order to improve the robot control, we are interested in three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction of the anatomy and in automatic tool localization using a stereo microscope.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we solve this problem for the first time using a single pipeline, starting from uncalibrated cameras to reach metric 3-D reconstruction and registration, in retinal microsurgery.	Semantic Scholar
The key ingredients of our method are 1) surgical tool landmark detection, and 2) 3-D reconstruction with the stereo microscope, using the detected landmarks.	Semantic Scholar
To address the former, we propose a novel deep learning method that detects and recognizes keypoints in high-definition images at higher than real-time speed.	Semantic Scholar
We use the detected two-dimensional keypoints along with their corresponding 3-D coordinates obtained from the robot sensors to calibrate the stereo microscope using an affine projection model.	Semantic Scholar
We design an online 3-D reconstruction pipeline that makes use of smoothness constraints and performs robot-to-camera registration.	Semantic Scholar
The entire pipeline is extensively validated on open-sky porcine eye sequences.	Semantic Scholar
Quantitative and qualitative results are presented for all steps.	Semantic Scholar
Object manipulation and fluid, goal-directed, movements require sensory information for effective execution.	Semantic Scholar
Amputees lose this intrinsic feedback when controlling their artificial limbs and must instead rely on visual information to compensate.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we describe an application for providing touch and kinesthetic information to amputees.	Semantic Scholar
We report on a soft robotic pneumatic actuator approach that can be incorporated into a prosthetic limb as the silicone suction socket liner itself.	Semantic Scholar
This approach alleviates many problems inherent to rigid tactors such as poor trim lines from external mounting, electromyography (EMG) signal contamination, and loss of limb fixation suction due to holes in the liner to pass touch and vibration to the residual limb.	Semantic Scholar
We analyzed two soft materials and different chamber geometries to generate a prototype.	Semantic Scholar
We characterized the static and dynamic properties of this prototype during operation obtaining a maximum force of 12.5 N at 70 kPa, free displacement of 4.5 mm at 50 kPa, and a bandwidth near 70 Hz.	Semantic Scholar
We presented an analytical model that fits well with the experimental data and provided a comparison between this soft pneumatic actuator and other rigid tactor devices.	Semantic Scholar
The results of testing the prototype in able-bodied participants and one amputee individual demonstrated that this soft pneumatic actuator achieved good performance at frequencies of 5 and 70 Hz at 60 kPa.	Semantic Scholar
In sequential days of training with the prototype participants reported perceptions of wrist flexion/extension and demonstrated learned associations between tapping and hand closing.	Semantic Scholar
High-speed, low-latency obstacle avoidance that is insensitive to sensor noise is essential for enabling multiple decentralized robots to function reliably in cluttered and dynamic environments.	Semantic Scholar
While other distributed multiagent collision avoidance systems exist, these systems require online geometric optimization where tedious parameter tuning and perfect sensing are necessary.	Semantic Scholar
We present a novel end-to-end framework to generate reactive collision avoidance policy for efficient distributed multiagent navigation.	Semantic Scholar
Our method formulates an agent's navigation strategy as a deep neural network mapping from the observed noisy sensor measurements to the agent's steering commands in terms of movement velocity.	Semantic Scholar
We train the network on a large number of frames of collision avoidance data collected by repeatedly running a multiagent simulator with different parameter settings.	Semantic Scholar
We validate the learned deep neural network policy in a set of simulated and real scenarios with noisy measurements and demonstrate that our method is able to generate a robust navigation strategy that is insensitive to imperfect sensing and works reliably in all situations.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that our method can be well generalized to scenarios that do not appear in our training data, including scenes with static obstacles and agents with different sizes.	Semantic Scholar

Unraveling the nature of the communication model that governs which two individuals in a swarm interact with each other is an important line of inquiry in the collective behavior sciences.	Semantic Scholar
A number of models have been proposed in the biological swarm literature, with the leading models being the metric, topological, and visual models.	Semantic Scholar
The hypothesis evaluated in this letter is whether the choice of a communication model impacts the performance of a tasked artificial swarm.	Semantic Scholar
The biological models are used to design coordination algorithms for a simulated swarm, which are evaluated over a range of six swarm robotics tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Each task has an associated set of performance metrics that are used to evaluate how the communication models fare against each other.	Semantic Scholar
The general findings demonstrate that the communication model significantly affects the swarm's performance for individual tasks, and this result implies that the communication model–task pairing is an important consideration when designing artificial swarms.	Semantic Scholar
Further analysis of each tasks’ performance metrics reveals instances in which pairwise considerations of model and one of the various experimental factors become relevant.	Semantic Scholar
The reported research demonstrates that the artificial swarm's task performance can be increased through the careful selection of a communication model.	Semantic Scholar
This paper addresses a tightly integrated multi-robot planning, localization and navigation system in stochastic scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
We present a novel motion planning technique for robot formations in such kinds of environments, which computes the most likely global path in terms of a defined minimum expected length (EL).	Semantic Scholar
EL evaluates the expected cost of a path considering the probability of finding a non traversable zone and the cost of using an alternative traversable path.	Semantic Scholar

This paper presents a novel recursive formulation for the simulation of multibody system dynamics based on Hamilton's canonical equations.	Semantic Scholar
Although Hamilton's canonical equations exhibit many advantageous features compared to their acceleration-based counterparts, it appears that there is a lack of dedicated parallel algorithms for multirigid body system dynamics based on this formulation.	Semantic Scholar
Serial kinematic chains are considered in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
Initially, the standard set of Hamilton's canonical equations is joined together with constraint equations at the velocity level.	Semantic Scholar
The reformulation determines the system's joint velocities and constraint force impulses in a divide and conquer manner resulting in logarithmic numerical cost for parallel implementation.	Semantic Scholar
Subsequently, the equations of motion are rearranged in order to obtain the time derivatives of the total joint momenta.	Semantic Scholar
In the case of the sequential implementation, the entire algorithm exhibits linear computational cost.	Semantic Scholar
Presented numerical method is exact and noniterative.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical test cases reveal negligible energy drift without the use of any additional constraint stabilization techniques.	Semantic Scholar
The results are compared against more standard acceleration based formulation and the outcome from real-life physical experiment.	Semantic Scholar
Parallel incremental learning is an effective approach for rapidly processing large scale data streams, where parallel and incremental learning are often treated as two separate problems and solved one after another.	Semantic Scholar
Incremental learning can be implemented by merging knowledge from incoming data and parallel learning can be performed by merging knowledge from simultaneous learners.	Semantic Scholar
We propose to simultaneously solve the two learning problems with a single process of knowledge merging, and we propose parallel incremental wESVM (weighted Extreme Support Vector Machine) to do so.	Semantic Scholar
Here, wESVM is reformulated such that knowledge from subsets of training data can be merged via simple matrix addition.	Semantic Scholar
As such, the proposed algorithm is able to conduct parallel incremental learning by merging knowledge over data slices arriving at each incremental stage.	Semantic Scholar
Both theoretical and experimental studies show the equivalence of the proposed algorithm to batch wESVM in terms of learning effectiveness.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the algorithm demonstrates desired scalability and clear speed advantages to batch retraining.	Semantic Scholar

This letter proposes a control framework allowing to position a robot in range and orientation with respect to a sound source from a binaural system.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, a sensor-based control framework is developed upon interaural level difference (ILD) cues.	Semantic Scholar
ILD is known to be implicitly related to the sound source azimuth, but also to the sound source distance.	Semantic Scholar
We emphasize the latter property by introducing the concept of ILD annulus.	Semantic Scholar
Then, a sensor-based task is designed in order to approach a sound source.	Semantic Scholar
This method is validated in simulation and in real world experiments performed on a humanoid robot.	Semantic Scholar
Neurons in many brain areas exhibit high trial-to-trial variability, with spike counts that are overdispersed relative to a Poisson distribution.	Semantic Scholar
Recent work (Goris, Movshon, & Simoncelli, 2014) has proposed to explain this variability in terms of a multiplicative interaction between a stochastic gain variable and a stimulus-dependent Poisson firing rate, which produces quadratic relationships between spike count mean and variance.	Semantic Scholar
Here we examine this quadratic assumption and propose a more flexible family of models that can account for a more diverse set of mean-variance relationships.	Semantic Scholar
Our model contains additive gaussian noise that is transformed nonlinearly to produce a Poisson spike rate.	Semantic Scholar
Different choices of the nonlinear function can give rise to qualitatively different mean-variance relationships, ranging from sublinear to linear to quadratic.	Semantic Scholar
Intriguingly, a rectified squaring nonlinearity produces a linear mean-variance function, corresponding to responses with a constant Fano factor.	Semantic Scholar
We describe a computationally efficient method for fitting this model to data and demonstrate that a majority of neurons in a V1 population are better described by a model with a nonquadratic relationship between mean and variance.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we demonstrate a practical use of our model via an application to Bayesian adaptive stimulus selection in closed-loop neurophysiology experiments, which shows that accounting for overdispersion can lead to dramatic improvements in adaptive tuning curve estimation.	Semantic Scholar
Human–robot interaction faces the challenge of designing and modeling tightly coupled and effectively controlled human–machine systems.	Semantic Scholar
This letter describes a method to learn human operator's performance characteristics from surface electromyography measurements to predict their intentions during task operations.	Semantic Scholar
For the first time, a layered hidden Markov model (LHMM) is successfully used with physiological data from cocontracting arm muscles to achieve accurate intent prediction.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, optimal model parameters and high-performing feature sets are identified and prediction accuracy at various time horizons calculated.	Semantic Scholar
The LHMM outperformed various other classification methods, including naive Bayes and support vector machine, ultimately achieving 82% accuracy in predicting the next 50 ms window of intent and maintaining 60% accuracy even after one second.	Semantic Scholar
These results hold the promise of improving robots’ internal model of their human partners, which could increase the safety and productivity of human–robot teams in the factories of the future.	Semantic Scholar
In fruit production, critical crop management decisions are guided by bloom intensity, i.e., the number of flowers present in an orchard.	Semantic Scholar
Despite its importance, bloom intensity is still typically estimated by means of human visual inspection.	Semantic Scholar
Existing automated computer vision systems for flower identification are based on hand-engineered techniques that work only under specific conditions and with limited performance.	Semantic Scholar
This letter proposes an automated technique for flower identification that is robust to uncontrolled environments and applicable to different flower species.	Semantic Scholar
Our method relies on an end-to-end residual convolutional neural network (CNN) that represents the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation.	Semantic Scholar
To enhance its sensitivity to flowers, we fine-tune this network using a single dataset of apple flower images.	Semantic Scholar
Since CNNs tend to produce coarse segmentations, we employ a refinement method to better distinguish between individual flower instances.	Semantic Scholar
Without any preprocessing or dataset-specific training, experimental results on images of apple, peach, and pear flowers, acquired under different conditions demonstrate the robustness and broad applicability of our method.	Semantic Scholar
This letter provides a comparative analysis of common strategies for sampling-based motion planning of fully actuated closed kinematic chains with revolute joints.	Semantic Scholar
Three strategies are reviewed: singularity sampling, swapping between the possible passive chains while using the active–passive chains kinematic approach, and using Newton–Raphson projections.	Semantic Scholar
The strategies are compared using analytical and empirical results.	Semantic Scholar
Various measures, such as sampling time and visibility, are used to analyze the strategies in several dual-arm planning problems using the three different planning algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
This comparative analysis provides insight into the strengths and weaknesses of each sampling strategy.	Semantic Scholar
Results indicate that the kinematic-based passive chains swapping strategy is more preferable in environments with obstacles but harder to implement for various robotic arms.	Semantic Scholar
During robot-aided surgical interventions, the surgeon can be benefitted from the application of virtual fixtures (VFs).	Semantic Scholar
Though very effective, this technique is very often not practicable in unstructured surgical environments.	Semantic Scholar
In order to comply with the environmental deformation, both the VF geometry and the constraint enforcement parameters need to be online defined/adapted.	Semantic Scholar

In multi agent mobile robotic systems, coordinating the gaze of each autonomous robot without the use of pre determined gaze attractors requires the sharing of either a gaze vector together with knowledge of the location of each robotic or sharing of a visual description of what the gaze should be directed at.	Semantic Scholar
In the latter case, this should consist of the least amount of data possible to reduce transmission delay and processing requirements.	Semantic Scholar
Sharing a single unique visual feature is sufficient to direct gaze.	Semantic Scholar
Unfortunately, typical feature detection methods are tuned to detect many hundreds of features to maximize successful matches in corresponding images.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents an alternate feature detection method that is tuned to select only a few, high quality features.	Semantic Scholar
Not only does this method achieve the accuracy of state of the art methods over the target range, it does so quicker and results in a significantly smaller amount of information that needs to be shared between agents for directing gaze to the same point of interest.	Semantic Scholar

Model-based classification of sequence data using a set of hidden Markov models is a well-known technique.	Semantic Scholar
The involved score function, which is often based on the class-conditional likelihood, can, however, be computationally demanding, especially for long data sequences.	Semantic Scholar
Inspired by recent theoretical advances in spectral learning of hidden Markov models, we propose a score function based on third-order moments.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we propose to use the Kullback-Leibler divergence between theoretical and empirical third-order moments for classification of sequence data with discrete observations.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method provides lower computational complexity at classification time than the usual likelihood-based methods.	Semantic Scholar
In order to demonstrate the properties of the proposed method, we perform classification of both simulated data and empirical data from a human activity recognition study.	Semantic Scholar

Automatic social circle detection in ego-networks is a fundamentally important task for social network analysis.	Semantic Scholar
So far, most studies focused on how to detect overlapping circles or how to detect based on both network structure and node profiles.	Semantic Scholar
This paper asks an orthogonal research question: how to detect circles by leveraging multiple views of the network structure?	Semantic Scholar
As a first step, we crawl ego networks from Twitter and model them by six views, including user relationships, user interactions, and user content.	Semantic Scholar
We then apply both standard and our modified multi-view spectral clustering techniques to detect circles on these ego-networks.	Semantic Scholar
By extensive automatic and manual evaluations, we deliver two major findings: first, multi-view clustering techniques detect better circles than single-view clustering methods; second, our modified clustering technique which presumes sparse networks are incomplete detects better circles than the standard clustering technique which ignores such potential incompleteness.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the second finding makes us conjecture a direct application of standard clustering on potentially incomplete networks may yield biased results.	Semantic Scholar
We lightly investigate this issue by deriving a bias upper bound that integrates theories of spectral clustering and matrix perturbation, and discussing how the bound may be affected by several network characteristics.	Semantic Scholar
Nurses welcome innovative training and assessment methods to effectively interpret physiological vital signs.	Semantic Scholar
The objective is to determine if eye-tracking technology can be used to develop biometrics for automatically predict the performance of nurses whilst they interact with computer-based simulations.	Semantic Scholar
A total of 47 nurses were recruited, 36 nursing students (training group) and 11 coronary care nurses (qualified group).	Semantic Scholar
Each nurse interpreted five simulated vital signs scenarios whilst “thinking-aloud.” The participant's visual attention (eye-tracking metrics), verbalisation, heart rate, confidence level (1–10, 10 = most confident), and cognitive load (NASA-TLX) were recorded during performance.	Semantic Scholar
Scenario performances were scored out of ten.	Semantic Scholar
Analysis was used to find patterns between the eye-tracking metrics and performance score.	Semantic Scholar
Multiple linear regression was used to predict performance score using eye tracking metrics.	Semantic Scholar
The qualified group scored higher than the training group (6.85 ± 1.5 versus 4.59 ± 1.61, <italic>p</italic> = <0.0001) and reported greater confidence (7.51 ± 1.2 versus 5.79 ± 1.39, <italic>p</italic> = <0.0001).	Semantic Scholar
Regression using a selection of eye-tracking metrics was shown to adequately predict score (adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.80, <italic>p </italic> = <0.0001).	Semantic Scholar
This shows that eye tracking alone could predict a nurse's performance and can provide insight to the performance of a nurse when interpreting bedside monitors.	Semantic Scholar
Fast abnormal event detection meets the growing demand to process an enormous number of surveillance videos.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the inherent redundancy of video structures, we propose an efficient sparse combination learning framework with both batch and online solvers.	Semantic Scholar
It achieves decent performance in the detection phase without compromising result quality.	Semantic Scholar
The extremely fast execution speed is guaranteed owing to the fact that our method effectively turns the original complicated problem into a few small-scale least square optimizations.	Semantic Scholar
Our method reaches high detection rates on benchmark datasets at a speed of 1000–1200 frames per second on average when computing on an ordinary single core desktop PC using MATLAB.	Semantic Scholar
It is important to learn about the factors that affect a driver's willingness to rely on an automated driving system in order to maintain appropriate trust in the system.	Semantic Scholar
The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between the system behavior and a driver's trust by considering overtaking a scooter and passing a bicycle automatically.	Semantic Scholar
Using a driving simulator, we first investigated the peak driving speed, the peak lateral distance between the object and the test vehicle, and the first steering input timing of human drivers while overtaking or passing.	Semantic Scholar
Next, the obtained data were applied to the parameters to design an automated driving system.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we investigated the effects of differences in system behavior on drivers’ trust by varying the system parameters.	Semantic Scholar
The results demonstrated that drivers’ trust varied according to these three parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the analysis indicated that an automated driving system should maintain longer peak lateral distances and engage in steering manoeuvres earlier than human drivers would in order to maintain a subjectively appropriate lateral distance and steering manoeuvre start time, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the peak driving speeds for overtaking or passing should be kept almost equal to the manual speeds of human drivers to maintain subjectively appropriate driving speeds.	Semantic Scholar
Most existing formation control approaches are based on the assumption that the global/relative position and/or velocity measurements of mobile robots are directly available.	Semantic Scholar
To extend the application domain and to improve the formation control performance, it is extremely necessary to avoid the use of position and velocity measurements in the design of formation controllers.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose new leader-following formation tracking control schemes for nonholonomic mobile robots with onboard perspective cameras, without using both position and velocity measurements.	Semantic Scholar
To address the unavailability issue of position measurements, the leader–follower kinematics model in the image space is developed, which can facilitate the complete elimination of measurement/estimation of the position information.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, feedback information from the perspective camera of the follower robot is used to design adaptive observers to estimate the leader linear velocity for feedforward compensation, which can handle the absence of velocity measurements such that the proposed schemes can be applied to control formations of mobile robots without mutual communication abilities.

Majority voting is a popular and robust strategy to aggregate different opinions in learning from crowds, where each worker labels examples according to their own criteria.	Semantic Scholar
Although it has been extensively studied in the binary case, its behavior with multiple classes is not completely clear, specifically when annotations are biased.	Semantic Scholar
This paper attempts to fill that gap.	Semantic Scholar
The behavior of the majority voting strategy is studied in-depth in multi-class domains, emphasizing the effect of annotation bias.	Semantic Scholar
By means of a complete experimental setting, we show the limitations of the standard majority voting strategy.	Semantic Scholar
The use of three simple techniques that infer global information from the annotations and annotators allows us to put the performance of the majority voting strategy in context.	Semantic Scholar
Redundancy is a fundamental characteristic of many biological processes such as those in the genetic, visual, muscular, and nervous systems, yet its driven mechanism has not been fully comprehended.	Semantic Scholar
Until recently, the only understanding of redundancy is as a mean to attain fault tolerance, which is reflected in the design of many man-made systems.	Semantic Scholar
On the contrary, our previous work on redundant sensing (RS) has demonstrated an example where redundancy can be engineered solely for enhancing accuracy and precision.	Semantic Scholar
The design was inspired by the binocular structure of human vision, which we believe may share a similar operation.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a unified theory describing how such utilization of redundancy is feasible through two complementary mechanisms: representational redundancy (RPR) and entangled redundancy (ETR).	Semantic Scholar
We also point out two additional examples where our new understanding of redundancy can be applied to justify a system's superior performance.	Semantic Scholar
One is the human musculoskeletal system (HMS), a biological instance, and the other is the deep residual neural network (ResNet), an artificial counterpart.	Semantic Scholar
We envision that our theory would provide a framework for the future development of bio-inspired redundant artificial systems, as well as assist studies of the fundamental mechanisms governing various biological processes.	Semantic Scholar
Current methods to estimate object shape—using either vision or touch—generally depend on high-resolution sensing.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we exploit ergodic exploration to demonstrate successful shape estimation when using a low-resolution binary contact sensor.	Semantic Scholar
The measurement model is posed as a collision-based tactile measurement, and classification methods are used to discriminate between shape boundary regions in the search space.	Semantic Scholar
Posterior likelihood estimates of the measurement model help the system actively seek out regions where the binary sensor is most likely to return informative measurements.	Semantic Scholar
Results show successful shape estimation of various objects as well as the ability to identify multiple objects in an environment.	Semantic Scholar
Interestingly, it is shown that ergodic exploration utilizes noncontact motion to gather significant information about shape.	Semantic Scholar

Deal selection on Groupon is a typical social learning and decision making process, where the quality of a deal is usually unknown to the customers.	Semantic Scholar
The customers must acquire this knowledge through social learning from other social medias such as reviews on Yelp.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, the quality of a deal depends on both the state of the vendor and decisions of other customers on Groupon.	Semantic Scholar
How social learning and network externality affect the decisions of customers in deal selection on Groupon is our main interest.	Semantic Scholar
We develop a data-driven game-theoretic framework to understand the rational deal selection behaviors cross social medias.	Semantic Scholar
The sufficient condition of the Nash equilibrium is identified.	Semantic Scholar
A value-iteration algorithm is proposed to find the optimal deal selection strategy.	Semantic Scholar
We conduct a year-long experiment to trace the competitions among deals on Groupon and the corresponding Yelp ratings.	Semantic Scholar
We utilize the dataset to analyze the deal selection game with realistic settings.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the performance of the proposed social learning framework is evaluated with real data.	Semantic Scholar
The results suggest that customers do make decisions in a rational way instead of following naive strategies, and there is still room to improve their decisions with assistance from the proposed framework.	Semantic Scholar
Theoretical spring mass models with deadbeat foot placement policies reveal very robust running in the presence of large and frequent, unexpected gait disturbances.	Semantic Scholar
Although this performance goes beyond what has been demonstrated on running machines, a transfer of this theory has only been investigated for simplified monopod systems.	Semantic Scholar
Here we investigate how well the control strategies developed for the spring mass model transfer to more complex and human-like robots.	Semantic Scholar
We use a model-based control framework to implement the spring mass behavior on a bipedal robot of human scale and weight with articulated legs and an actively stabilized trunk.	Semantic Scholar
Evaluating the tracking performance in robot experiments on undisturbed and disturbed running, we find that our controller achieves tracking consistent with the underlying model for velocity changes of $\pm \text{0.2}\,\text{m/s}^{-1}$.	Semantic Scholar
For larger velocity changes and ground height disturbances up to $\pm \text{15}\,\text{cm}$, the controller performance degrades but the robot maintains running.	Semantic Scholar
Based on perturbed simulations of the simplified model, we conclude that the degradation is largely related to force disturbances not considered in the underlying spring mass control theory.	Semantic Scholar
The results highlight both limitations of the existing spring mass theory for control of more complex machines and a spring mass model-based control that generates robust and versatile behavior in running robots.	Semantic Scholar
Modeling and interpreting spike train data is a task of central importance in computational neuroscience, with significant translational implications.	Semantic Scholar
Two popular classes of data-driven models for this task are autoregressive point-process generalized linear models (PPGLM) and latent state-space models (SSM) with point-process observations.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we derive a mathematical connection between these two classes of models.	Semantic Scholar
By introducing an auxiliary history process, we represent exactly a PPGLM in terms of a latent, infinite-dimensional dynamical system, which can then be mapped onto an SSM by basis function projections and moment closure.	Semantic Scholar
This representation provides a new perspective on widely used methods for modeling spike data and also suggests novel algorithmic approaches to fitting such models.	Semantic Scholar
We illustrate our results on a phasic bursting neuron model, showing that our proposed approach provides an accurate and efficient way to capture neural dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
We describe how to compute very far decimals of $$\pi $$ π and how to provide formal guarantees that the decimals we compute are correct.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we report on an experiment where 1 million decimals of $$\pi $$ π and the billionth hexadecimal (without the preceding ones) have been computed in a formally verified way.	Semantic Scholar
Three methods have been studied, the first one relying on a spigot formula to obtain at a reasonable cost only one distant digit (more precisely a hexadecimal digit, because the numeration basis is 16) and the other two relying on arithmetic–geometric means.	Semantic Scholar
All proofs and computations can be made inside the Coq system.	Semantic Scholar
We detail the new formalized material that was necessary for this achievement and the techniques employed to guarantee the accuracy of the computed digits, in spite of the necessity to work with fixed precision numerical computation.	Semantic Scholar

This technology enhances the surgeon's dexterity through the use of a multiarm robot with wristed instruments that enter a patient's body through small incisions.	Semantic Scholar
However, the size of existing instruments (5-8 mm in shaft diameter) has prevented the adoption of the da Vinci system in areas such as neurosurgery, head and neck surgery, and pediatrics [2], [3].	Semantic Scholar

The control of compliant joint manipulators is challenging for two reasons.	Semantic Scholar
First, the elastic elements of the compliant actuators can store an important amount of energy that can be potentially dangerous and needs therefore to be controlled.	Semantic Scholar
Second, the compliance introduces nonlinearities and uncertainties in the system.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a new control scheme, the Variable Boundary layer Sliding Mode Control (VBSMC) for a safe and performant control of compliant joint manipulators.	Semantic Scholar
The control method allows achieving various interaction levels while maintaining good tracking performances.	Semantic Scholar
This is realized by adjusting the torque limit parameter and the expanding factor of the controller.	Semantic Scholar
Tests have been carried on the collaborative robot Baxter in order to compare the tracking performances and the safe behavior of the VBSMC with the internal controller of the robot.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that the VBSMC exhibits either similar or higher tracking performances than the robot controller and can achieve different interaction levels.	Semantic Scholar
Neural noise sets a limit to information transmission in sensory systems.	Semantic Scholar
In several areas, the spiking response (to a repeated stimulus) has shown a higher degree of regularity than predicted by a Poisson process.	Semantic Scholar
However, a simple model to explain this low variability is still lacking.	Semantic Scholar
Here we introduce a new model, with a correction to Poisson statistics, that can accurately predict the regularity of neural spike trains in response to a repeated stimulus.	Semantic Scholar
The model has only two parameters but can reproduce the observed variability in retinal recordings in various conditions.	Semantic Scholar
We show analytically why this approximation can work.	Semantic Scholar
In a model of the spike-emitting process where a refractory period is assumed, we derive that our simple correction can well approximate the spike train statistics over a broad range of firing rates.	Semantic Scholar
Our model can be easily plugged to stimulus processing models, like a linear-nonlinear model or its generalizations, to replace the Poisson spike train hypothesis that is commonly assumed.	Semantic Scholar
It estimates the amount of information transmitted much more accurately than Poisson models in retinal recordings.	Semantic Scholar
Thanks to its simplicity, this model has the potential to explain low variability in other areas.	Semantic Scholar
Body flexibility plays an important role in the bounding gait of quadruped animals.	Semantic Scholar
In a previous study, we investigated the effects of body flexibility on foot loading by comparing two different physical models, with and without a flexible body-joint.	Semantic Scholar
Testing both models with equal mechanical energy revealed two conflicting results: Body flexibility reduced the maximum ground reaction force, but a stiffer body exhibited a smaller maximum ground reaction force than a highly flexible body.	Semantic Scholar
Because of the complex nature of the model dynamics, the mechanisms underlying these results are unclear.	Semantic Scholar
In the current study, we used a simplified analytical model by assuming physical constraints on our previous model to clarify the dynamic roles of body flexibility, particularly regarding foot loading.	Semantic Scholar
Approximate periodic solutions were derived by linearization of the governing equations and provide an explanation for our conflicting results.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we discussed the biological relevance of our findings using a comparison of our analytical results with observations of movement in cheetahs.	Semantic Scholar
Our findings will not only improve the understanding of motor control mechanisms for fast locomotion in quadruped animals, but also provide a guiding principle for the mechanical and control design of legged robots capable of fast locomotion.	Semantic Scholar
Hierarchical probabilistic models, such as mixture models, are used for cluster analysis.	Semantic Scholar
These models have two types of variables: observable and latent.	Semantic Scholar
In cluster analysis, the latent variable is estimated, and it is expected that additional information will improve the accuracy of the estimation of the latent variable.	Semantic Scholar
Many proposed learning methods are able to use additional data; these include semi-supervised learning and transfer learning.	Semantic Scholar
However, from a statistical point of view, a complex probabilistic model that encompasses both the initial and additional data might be less accurate due to having a higher-dimensional parameter.	Semantic Scholar
The present paper presents a theoretical analysis of the accuracy of such a model and clarifies which factor has the greatest effect on its accuracy, the advantages of obtaining additional data, and the disadvantages of increasing the complexity.	Semantic Scholar
Herein we close the question of the equivalence of shiny and strongly polite theories by establishing that, for theories with a decidable quantifier-free satisfiability problem, the set of many-sorted shiny theories coincides with the set of many-sorted strongly polite theories.	Semantic Scholar

Outlier detection acts as one of the most important analysis tasks for trajectory stream.	Semantic Scholar
In stream scenarios, such properties as unlimitedness, time-varying evolutionary, sparsity, and skewness distribution of trajectories pose new challenges to outlier detection technique.	Semantic Scholar
Trajectory outlier detection techniques mainly focus on finding trajectory that is dissimilar to the majority of the others, which is based on the hypothesis that they are probably generated by a different mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
Most distance-based methods tend to utilize a function (e.g., weighted linear sum) to measure the similarity of two arbitrary objects provided that representative features have been extracted in advance.	Semantic Scholar
However, this kind of method is not tailored to identify the outlier which is close to its neighbors according to some features, but behaves significantly different from its neighbors in terms of the other features.	Semantic Scholar
To address this issue, we propose a feature grouping-based mechanism that divides all the features into two groups, where the first group (Similarity Feature) is used to find close neighbors and the second group (Difference Feature) is used to find outliers within the similar neighborhood.	Semantic Scholar
According to the feature differences among local adjacent objects in one or more time intervals, we present two outlier definitions, including local anomaly trajectory fragment (TF-outlier) and evolutionary anomaly moving object (MO-outlier ).	Semantic Scholar
We devise a basic solution and then an optimized algorithm to detect both types of outliers.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that our proposal is both effective and efficient to detect outliers upon trajectory data streams.	Semantic Scholar

Teleoperation and virtual reality systems benefit from force sensory substitution when kinesthetic force feedback devices are infeasible due to stability or workspace limitations.	Semantic Scholar
We compared the performance of sensory substitution when it is provided through a cutaneous method (skin deformation feedback) and a kinesthetic method (hand-grounded force feedback).	Semantic Scholar
For skin deformation feedback, we used a new force-controlled tactile sensory substitution device with the ability to provide tangential and normal force directly to the finger pad.	Semantic Scholar
Three-axis force control with 15 Hz bandwidth was achieved using a delta mechanism and three-axis force sensor.	Semantic Scholar
For hand-grounded force feedback, forces were grounded against the palm.	Semantic Scholar
As a control, world-grounded force feedback was provided using a three-degree-of-freedom kinesthetic force feedback device.	Semantic Scholar
Study participants were able to match a reference world-grounded force better with hand-grounded kinesthetic force feedback than with skin deformation feedback.	Semantic Scholar
Participants were also able to apply more accurate and precise forces with hand-grounded kinesthetic force feedback than with skin deformation feedback.	Semantic Scholar
Conversely, skin deformation feedback resulted in the lowest error during initial force adjustment.	Semantic Scholar
These experiments demonstrate relative advantages and disadvantages of skin deformation and hand-grounded kinesthetic force feedback for force sensory substitution.	Semantic Scholar

We also propose how this framework may be extended to take into account Aging effects as more performance data becomes available.	Semantic Scholar

Although Hebbian learning has long been a key component in understanding neural plasticity, it has not yet been successful in modeling modulatory feedback connections, which make up a significant portion of connections in the brain.	Semantic Scholar
We develop a new learning rule designed around the complications of learning modulatory feedback and composed of three simple concepts grounded in physiologically plausible evidence.	Semantic Scholar
Using border ownership as a prototypical example, we show that a Hebbian learning rule fails to properly learn modulatory connections, while our proposed rule correctly learns a stimulus-driven model.	Semantic Scholar
To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time a border ownership network has been learned.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, we show that the rule can be used as a drop-in replacement for a Hebbian learning rule to learn a biologically consistent model of orientation selectivity, a network which lacks any modulatory connections.	Semantic Scholar
Our results predict that the mechanisms we use are integral for learning modulatory connections in the brain and furthermore that modulatory connections have a strong dependence on inhibition.	Semantic Scholar
While tactile sensor technology has made great strides over the past decades, applications in robotic manipulation are limited by aspects such as blind spots, difficult integration into hands, and low spatial resolution.	Semantic Scholar
We present a method for localizing contact with high accuracy over curved, 3-D surfaces, with a low wire count and reduced integration complexity.	Semantic Scholar
To achieve this, we build a volume of soft material embedded with individual off-the-shelf pressure sensors.	Semantic Scholar
Using data-driven techniques, we map the raw signals from these pressure sensors to known surface locations and indentation depths.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, we show that a finite-element model can be used to improve the placement of the pressure sensors inside the volume and to explore the design space in simulation.	Semantic Scholar
"We validate our approach on physically implemented tactile domes that achieve high contact localization accuracy (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\text{1.1}\,\text{mm}$</tex-math></inline-formula> in the best case) over a large, curved sensing area (<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\text{1300-mm}^2$</tex-math></inline-formula> hemisphere)."

Bimanual gestures are of the utmost importance for the study of motor coordination in humans and in everyday activities.	Semantic Scholar
A reliable detection of bimanual gestures in unconstrained environments is fundamental for their clinical study and to assess common activities of daily living.	Semantic Scholar
This paper investigates techniques for a reliable, unconstrained detection and classification of bimanual gestures.	Semantic Scholar
It assumes the availability of inertial data originating from the two hands/arms, builds upon a previously developed technique for gesture modelling based on Gaussian Mixture Modelling (GMM) and Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR), and compares different modelling and classification techniques, which are based on a number of assumptions inspired by literature about how bimanual gestures are represented and modelled in the brain.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments show results related to 5 everyday bimanual activities, which have been selected on the basis of three main parameters: (not) constraining the two hands by a physical tool, (not) requiring a specific sequence of single-hand gestures, being recursive (or not).	Semantic Scholar
In the best performing combination of modelling approach and classification technique, five out of five activities are recognised up to an accuracy of 97%, a precision of 82% and a level of recall of 100%.	Semantic Scholar
What is the growth dynamics of social networks, like Facebook or WeChat?	Semantic Scholar
Does it truly exhibit exponential early-growth, as predicted by the celebrated models, like the Bass model?	Semantic Scholar
How about the dynamics of links, for which there are few published models?	Semantic Scholar
For the first time, we examine the growth of WeChat which is the largest online social network in China, together with several other real social networks.	Semantic Scholar
We observe Power-Law growth dynamics for both nodes and links, a fact that breaks the textbook models featuring Sigmoid curves.	Semantic Scholar
We propose <sc>NetTide</sc>, along with differential equations for the growth of nodes and links.	Semantic Scholar
Our model fits the growth dynamics of real social networks well; it encompasses many traditional growth dynamics as special cases, while remaining parsimonious in parameters.	Semantic Scholar
The <sc>NetTide</sc> for link growth is the first one of its kind, accurately fitting real data, and capturing densification phenomenon.	Semantic Scholar
We further formulate two stochastic generators, which interpret the growth of nodes and links through survival analysis and micro-level interactions within a social network, respectively.	Semantic Scholar

While wearable cameras are becoming increasingly popular, locating relevant information in large unstructured collections of egocentric images is still a tedious and time consuming process.	Semantic Scholar
This paper addresses the problem of organizing egocentric photo streams acquired by a wearable camera into semantically meaningful segments, hence making an important step towards the goal of automatically annotating these photos for browsing and retrieval.	Semantic Scholar
In the proposed method, first, contextual and semantic information is extracted for each image by employing a Convolutional Neural Networks approach.	Semantic Scholar
Later, a vocabulary of concepts is defined in a semantic space by relying on linguistic information.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, by exploiting the temporal coherence of concepts in photo streams, images which share contextual and semantic attributes are grouped together.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting temporal segmentation is particularly suited for further analysis, ranging from event recognition to semantic indexing and summarization.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results over egocentric set of nearly 31,000 images, show the prominence of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
Learning unknown objects in the environment is important for detection and manipulation tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Prior to learning the unknown objects the ground-truth labels have to be provided.	Semantic Scholar
The data annotation or labeling can be achieved in a number of ways but the most widely used method is still manual annotation.	Semantic Scholar
Although manual annotation has shown superior performance, it limits robots’ capabilities to known object instances and is also a time consuming task.	Semantic Scholar
This letter considers the aforementioned limitations and presents a method that allows robots to autonomously annotate objects from observations of human–object interactions.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we present a novel method that segments handheld objects in real-time using the class-agnostic deep comparison and segmentation network.	Semantic Scholar
The inputs to the network are the RGB-D data of known object template and a search space, and it outputs a pixel-wise label of the object and an objectness score.	Semantic Scholar
The score indicates the likelihood that the same object is present in both the inputs.	Semantic Scholar
The object template is manually initialized in the first frame and thereafter, the object is segmented and the template is updated online.	Semantic Scholar
The template is strategically updated using the likelihood score.	Semantic Scholar
The segmented object regions are accumulated as pseudo-ground-truth labels, which are used for object learning.	Semantic Scholar
The approach efficiently handles both rigid and highly deformable objects.	Semantic Scholar
Effects of shortcut connection on metastable dynamical rotating waves in a ring of sigmoidal neurons with unidirectional excitatory coupling are considered.	Semantic Scholar
A kinematical equation describing the propagation of wave fronts is derived with a sign function for the output function of neurons.	Semantic Scholar
Unstable rotating waves can be stabilized in the presence of an inhibitory shortcut.	Semantic Scholar
When a shortcut is excitatory and connects the most distant neurons, the dynamical metastability of rotating waves is lost.	Semantic Scholar
The duration of transient rotating waves then increases only linearly with the number of neurons, not exponentially.	Semantic Scholar
However, the dynamical metastability of rotating waves remains when a shortcut is local.	Semantic Scholar
In a sensory neural network, where a population of presynaptic neurons sends information to a downstream neuron, maximizing information transmission depends on utilizing the full operating range of the output of the postsynaptic neuron.	Semantic Scholar
Because the convergence of presynaptic inputs naturally biases higher outputs, a sparse input distribution would counter such bias and optimize information transmission.	Semantic Scholar

Feature descriptors are powerful tools for photometrically and geometrically invariant image matching.	Semantic Scholar
To date, however, their use has been tied to sparse interest point detection, which is susceptible to noise under adverse imaging conditions.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose to use binary feature descriptors in a direct tracking framework without relying on sparse interest points.	Semantic Scholar
This novel combination of feature descriptors and direct tracking is shown to achieve robust and efficient visual odometry with applications to poorly lit subterranean environments.	Semantic Scholar
The start of the cue is often used to initiate the feature window used to control motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems.	Semantic Scholar
However, the time latency during an MI period varies between trials for each participant.	Semantic Scholar
Fixing the starting time point of MI features can lead to decreased system performance in MI-based BCI systems.	Semantic Scholar
To address this issue, we propose a novel correlation-based time window selection (CTWS) algorithm for MI-based BCIs.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, the optimized reference signals for each class were selected based on correlation analysis and performance evaluation.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the starting points of time windows for both training and testing samples were adjusted using correlation analysis.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the feature extraction and classification algorithms were used to calculate the classification accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
With two datasets, the results demonstrate that the CTWS algorithm significantly improved the system performance when compared to directly using feature extraction approaches.	Semantic Scholar
Importantly, the average improvement in accuracy of the CTWS algorithm on the datasets of healthy participants and stroke patients was 16.72% and 5.24%, respectively when compared to traditional common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the average accuracy increased 7.36% and 9.29%, respectively when the CTWS was used in conjunction with Sub-Alpha-Beta Log-Det Divergences (Sub-ABLD) algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
These findings suggest that the proposed CTWS algorithm holds promise as a general feature extraction approach for MI-based BCIs.	Semantic Scholar
Predicting the grasping function during reach-to-grasp motions is essential for controlling a prosthetic hand or a robotic assistive device.	Semantic Scholar
An early accurate prediction increases the usability and the comfort of a prosthetic device.	Semantic Scholar
This work proposes an electromyographic-based learning approach that decodes the grasping intention at an early stage of reach-to-grasp motion, i.e.	Semantic Scholar
before the final grasp/hand pre-shape takes place.	Semantic Scholar
Superficial electrodes and a Cyberglove were used to record the arm muscle activity and the finger joints during reach-to-grasp motions.	Semantic Scholar

This paper investigates the anti-synchronization of complex-valued memristor-based neural networks with time delays via designed external controllers.	Semantic Scholar
By constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions and using inequality technique, two different types of controllers are derived to guarantee the exponential anti-synchronization of complex-valued memristor-based delayed neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
Compared with existing relevant results, the proposed results of this paper are more general and less conservative.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the presented theoretical results are easy to be checked with the parameters of systems themselves.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, an example with numerical simulations illustrates the effectiveness of the obtained results.	Semantic Scholar
Electrophysiology is entering the era of big data.	Semantic Scholar
Multiple probes, each with hundreds to thousands of individual electrodes, are now capable of simultaneously recording from many brain regions.	Semantic Scholar
The major challenge confronting these new technologies is transforming the raw data into physiologically meaningful signals, that is, single unit spikes.	Semantic Scholar
Sorting the spike events of individual neurons from a spatiotemporally dense sampling of the extracellular electric field is a problem that has attracted much attention (Rey, Pedreira, & Quian Quiroga, 2015; Rossant et al., 2016) but is still far from solved.	Semantic Scholar
Current methods still rely on human input and thus become unfeasible as the size of the data sets grows exponentially.	Semantic Scholar
Here we introduce the -student stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) dimensionality reduction method (Van der Maaten & Hinton, 2008) as a visualization tool in the spike sorting process.	Semantic Scholar
t-SNE embeds the -dimensional extracellular spikes ( = number of features by which each spike is decomposed) into a low- (usually two-) dimensional space.	Semantic Scholar
We show that such embeddings, even starting from different feature spaces, form obvious clusters of spikes that can be easily visualized and manually delineated with a high degree of precision.	Semantic Scholar
We propose that these clusters represent single units and test this assertion by applying our algorithm on labeled data sets from both hybrid (Rossant et al., 2016) and paired juxtacellular/extracellular recordings (Neto et al., 2016).	Semantic Scholar
We have released a graphical user interface (GUI) written in Python as a tool for the manual clustering of the t-SNE embedded spikes and as a tool for an informed overview and fast manual curation of results from different clustering algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the generated visualizations offer evidence in favor of the use of probes with higher density and smaller electrodes.	Semantic Scholar
They also graphically demonstrate the diverse nature of the sorting problem when spikes are recorded with different methods and arise from regions with different background spiking statistics.	Semantic Scholar
The proliferation of e-commerce calls for mining consumer preferences and opinions from user-generated text.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, topic models have been widely adopted to discover the underlying semantic themes (i.e., topics).	Semantic Scholar
Supervised topic models have emerged to leverage discovered topics for predicting the response of interest (e.g., product quality and sales).	Semantic Scholar
However, supervised topic modeling remains a challenging problem because of the need to prespecify the number of topics, the lack of predictive information in topics, and limited scalability.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a novel supervised topic model, Hierarchical Dirichlet Process-based Inverse Regression (HDP-IR).	Semantic Scholar
HDP-IR characterizes the corpus with a flexible number of topics, which prove to retain as much predictive information as the original corpus.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we develop an efficient inference algorithm capable of examining large-scale corpora (millions of documents or more).	Semantic Scholar
Three experiments were conducted to evaluate the predictive performance over major e-commerce benchmark testbeds of online reviews.	Semantic Scholar
Overall, HDP-IR outperformed existing state-of-the-art supervised topic models.	Semantic Scholar
Particularly, retaining sufficient predictive information improved predictive R-squared by over 17.6 percent; having topic structure flexibility contributed to predictive R-squared by at least 4.1 percent.	Semantic Scholar
HDP-IR provides an important step for future study on user-generated texts from a topic perspective.	Semantic Scholar
There have been many attempts to classify imbalanced data, since this classification is critical in a wide variety of applications related to the detection of anomalies, failures, and risks.	Semantic Scholar
Many conventional methods, which can be categorized into sampling, cost-sensitive, or ensemble, include heuristic and task dependent processes.	Semantic Scholar
In order to achieve a better classification performance by formulation without heuristics and task dependence, we propose confusion-matrix-based kernel logistic regression (CM-KLOGR).	Semantic Scholar
Its objective function is the harmonic mean of various evaluation criteria derived from a confusion matrix, such criteria as sensitivity, positive predictive value, and others for negatives.	Semantic Scholar
This objective function and its optimization are consistently formulated on the framework of KLOGR, based on minimum classification error and generalized probabilistic descent (MCE/GPD) learning.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the merits of the harmonic mean, KLOGR, and MCE/GPD, CM-KLOGR improves the multifaceted performances in a well-balanced way.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents the formulation of CM-KLOGR and its effectiveness through experiments that comparatively evaluated CM-KLOGR using benchmark imbalanced datasets.	Semantic Scholar
There have been numerous studies on human–machine cooperative systems.	Semantic Scholar
In such studies, it is generally preferable to consider human maneuverability and motion during machine operation as well as considering mechanical parameters.	Semantic Scholar
However, many of the current studies only evaluate the mechanical parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Although some studies have evaluated human parameters, these remain subjective.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, in this study, upper extremity movement and muscle and brain activation during machine operation with inertia and friction were measured quantitatively.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental conditions were divided into nine classes.	Semantic Scholar

Monocular depth estimation offers a geometry-independent paradigm to detect free, navigable space with minimum space, and power consumption.	Semantic Scholar
These represent highly desirable features, especially for microaerial vehicles.	Semantic Scholar
In order to guarantee robust operation in real-world scenarios, the estimator is required to generalize well in diverse environments.	Semantic Scholar
Most of the existent depth estimators do not consider generalization, and only benchmark their performance on publicly available datasets after specific fine tuning.	Semantic Scholar
Generalization can be achieved by training on several heterogeneous datasets, but their collection and labeling is costly.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a deep neural network for scene depth estimation that is trained on synthetic datasets, which allow inexpensive generation of ground truth data.	Semantic Scholar
We show how this approach is able to generalize well across different scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we show how the addition of long short-term memory layers in the network helps to alleviate, in sequential image streams, some of the intrinsic limitations of monocular vision, such as global scale estimation, with low computational overhead.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate that the network is able to generalize well with respect to different real-world environments without any fine tuning, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on the KITTI dataset.	Semantic Scholar

In this work we consider preference relations that might not be total.	Semantic Scholar
Partial preferences may be helpful to represent those situations where, due to lack of information or vacillating desires, the decision maker would like to maintain different options “alive” and defer the final decision.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we show that, when totality is relaxed, different axiomatizations of classical Decision Theory are no longer equivalent but form a hierarchy where some of them are more restrictive than others.	Semantic Scholar
We compare such axiomatizations with respect to theoretical aspects—such as their ability to propagate comparability/incomparability over lotteries and the induced topology—and to different preference elicitation methodologies that are applicable in concrete domains.	Semantic Scholar
We also provide a polynomial-time procedure based on the bipartite matching problem to determine whether one lottery is preferred to another.	Semantic Scholar
Constrained optimal feedback controllers can be used to mitigate external perturbations and modeling errors in robot control.	Semantic Scholar
However, these controllers require extensive calculation that is one of their main limitations in real-time implementation.	Semantic Scholar
Here we present two locally optimal feedback controllers that can be efficiently computed online in real-time.	Semantic Scholar
These controllers are applicable to systems with nonlinear dynamics, nonlinear state and control dependent cost, and box constrained control inputs.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed locally optimal controllers differ from alternative feedback and re-computed feed-forward model predictive controllers which provide sub-optimal inputs and require significantly more online calculation in real-time implementation.	Semantic Scholar
Theoretical arguments, a numerical simulation, and a robot control experiment substantiate our claims, and show the applicability of the proposed efficiently computable constrained optimal feedback control method.	Semantic Scholar
Robotic manipulation tasks require the knowledge on the configuration of the object in use.	Semantic Scholar
Since most objects are generally not equipped with any sensor, an estimator is required.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, if an object is articulated, i.e., includes passive joints, the estimation process has to reconstruct the pose of the object floating base and its joints variables, concurrently with the manipulation control.	Semantic Scholar
We address the estimation problem with an online virtual visual servoing paradigm written as a quadratic program.	Semantic Scholar
Our estimator is integrated in closed-loop with the manipulation control governing the robot, which is also a quadratic program.	Semantic Scholar
Tracking and manipulation experiments, using a humanoid, show the effectiveness of our approach.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we present a novel pipeline for large-scale SfM.	Semantic Scholar
We first organise the images into a hierarchical tree built using agglomerative clustering.	Semantic Scholar
The SfM problem is then solved by reconstructing smaller image sets and merging them into a common frame of reference as we move up the tree in a bottom-up fashion.	Semantic Scholar
Such an approach drastically reduces the computational load for matching image pairs without sacrificing accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
It also makes the resulting sequence of bundle adjustment problems well-conditioned at all stages of reconstruction.	Semantic Scholar
We use motion averaging followed by global bundle adjustment for reconstruction of each individual cluster.	Semantic Scholar
Our 3D registration or alignment of partial reconstructions based on epipolar relationships is both robust and reliable and works well even when the available camera-point relationships are poorly conditioned.	Semantic Scholar
The overall result is a robust, accurate and efficient pipeline for large-scale SfM.	Semantic Scholar
We present extensive results that demonstrate these attributes of our pipeline on a number of large-scale, real-world datasets and compare with the state-of-the-art.	Semantic Scholar
Motion planning algorithms that rely upon the randomly exploring random tree (RRT) typically require the user to choose an appropriate stepsize; this is generally a highly problem-dependent and time-consuming process requiring trial and error.	Semantic Scholar
We propose an adaptive stepsize RRT path planning algorithm for open-chain robots in which only a minimum obstacle size parameter is required as input.	Semantic Scholar
Exploiting the structure of an open chain's forward kinematics as well as a standard inequality bound on the operator-induced matrix norm, we derive a maximum Cartesian displacement bound between two configurations of the same robot, and use this bound to determine a maximum allowable stepsize at each iteration.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical experiments involving a ten-DOF planar open chain and a seven-axis industrial robot arm demonstrate the practical advantages of our algorithm over standard fixed-stepsize RRT planning algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Most human–drone interfaces, such as joysticks and remote controllers, require attention and developed skills during teleoperation.	Semantic Scholar
Wearable interfaces could enable a more natural and intuitive control of drones, which would make this technology accessible to a larger population of users.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we describe a soft exoskeleton, so called FlyJacket, designed for naïve users that want to control a drone with upper body gestures in an intuitive manner.	Semantic Scholar
The exoskeleton includes a motion-tracking device to monitor body movements, an arm support system to prevent fatigue, and is coupled to goggles for first-person-view from the drone perspective.	Semantic Scholar
Tests were performed with participants flying a simulated fixed-wing drone moving at a constant speed; participants’ performance was more consistent when using the FlyJacket with the arm support than when performing the same task with a remote controller.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, participants felt more immersed, had more sensation of flying, and reported less fatigue when the arm support was enabled.	Semantic Scholar
The FlyJacket has been demonstrated for the teleoperation of a real drone.	Semantic Scholar
Numerous single-image super-resolution algorithms have been proposed in the literature, but few studies address the problem of performance evaluation based on visual perception.	Semantic Scholar
While most super-resolution images are evaluated by fullreference metrics, the effectiveness is not clear and the required ground-truth images are not always available in practice.	Semantic Scholar
To address these problems, we conduct human subject studies using a large set of super-resolution images and propose a no-reference metric learned from visual perceptual scores.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we design three types of low-level statistical features in both spatial and frequency domains to quantify super-resolved artifacts, and learn a two-stage regression model to predict the quality scores of super-resolution images without referring to groundtruth images.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experimental results show that the proposed metric is effective and efficient to assess the quality of super-resolution images based on human perception.	Semantic Scholar

In a recent paper, a method called “texture characteristic based morphological component analysis” (TC-MCA) has been proposed to enhance the performances of texture-based image segmentation algorithms: 1) TC-MCA separates texture into multiple pairs of components each representing a different visual characteristic of the texture; 2) then the TC-MCA algorithm manipulates each component and recombines them to produce the enhanced image where textures are more different, so that the texture-based segmentation is improved.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a novel method outperforming TC-MCA by: 1) applying dictionaries based on dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) to decompose the image into components representing different visual characteristics of texture, and 2) manipulating the dual-tree complex wavelet coefficients of the texture components to enhance each texture component’s own property and producing an texture-difference-enhanced image by recombining the enhanced components.

User participation in online communities is driven by the intertwinement of the social network structure with the crowd-generated content that flows along its links.	Semantic Scholar
These aspects are rarely explored jointly and at scale.	Semantic Scholar
By looking at how users generate and access pictures of varying beauty on Flickr, we investigate how the production of quality impacts the dynamics of online social systems.	Semantic Scholar
We develop a deep learning computer vision model to score images according to their aesthetic value and we validate its output through crowdsourcing.	Semantic Scholar
By applying it to over 15 B Flickr photos, we study for the first time how image beauty is distributed over a large-scale social system.	Semantic Scholar
Beautiful images are evenly distributed in the network, although only a small core of people get social recognition for them.	Semantic Scholar
To study the impact of exposure to quality on user engagement, we set up matching experiments aimed at detecting causality from observational data.	Semantic Scholar
Exposure to beauty is double-edged: following people who produce high-quality content increases one’s probability of uploading better photos; however, an excessive imbalance between the quality generated by a user and the user’s neighbors leads to a decline in engagement.	Semantic Scholar
Our analysis has practical implications for improving link recommender systems.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a discriminative aggregation network method for video-based face recognition and person re-identification, which aims to integrate information from video frames for feature representation effectively and efficiently.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike existing video aggregation methods, our method aggregates raw video frames directly instead of the features obtained by complex processing.	Semantic Scholar
By combining the idea of metric learning and adversarial learning, we learn an aggregation network to generate more discriminative images compared to the raw input frames.	Semantic Scholar
Our framework reduces the number of image frames per video to be processed and significantly speeds up the recognition procedure.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, low-quality frames containing misleading information can be well filtered and denoised during the aggregation procedure, which makes our method more robust and discriminative.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on several widely used datasets show that our method can generate discriminative images from video clips and improve the overall recognition performance in both the speed and the accuracy for video-based face recognition and person re-identification.	Semantic Scholar

The interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL is based on the well understood higher-order logic (HOL), which is widely believed to be consistent (and provably consistent in set theory by a standard semantic argument).	Semantic Scholar
However, Isabelle/HOL brings its own personal touch to HOL: overloaded constant definitions, used to provide the users with Haskell-like type classes.	Semantic Scholar
These features are a delight for the users, but unfortunately are not easy to get right as an extension of HOL—they have a history of inconsistent behavior.	Semantic Scholar
It has been an open question under which criteria overloaded constant definitions and type definitions can be combined together while still guaranteeing consistency.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a solution to this problem: non-overlapping definitions and termination of the definition-dependency relation (tracked not only through constants but also through types) ensures relative consistency of Isabelle/HOL.	Semantic Scholar
Most of graph construction techniques assume a transductive setting in which the whole data collection is available at construction time.	Semantic Scholar
Addressing graph construction for inductive setting, in which data are coming sequentially, has received much less attention.	Semantic Scholar
For inductive settings, constructing the graph from scratch can be very time consuming.	Semantic Scholar
This paper introduces a generic framework that is able to make any graph construction method incremental.	Semantic Scholar
This framework yields an efficient and dynamic graph construction method that adds new samples (labeled or unlabeled) to a previously constructed graph.	Semantic Scholar
As a case study, we use the recently proposed Two Phase Weighted Regularized Least Square (TPWRLS) graph construction method.	Semantic Scholar
The paper has two main contributions.	Semantic Scholar
First, we use the TPWRLS coding scheme to represent new sample(s) with respect to an existing database.	Semantic Scholar
The representative coefficients are then used to update the graph affinity matrix.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method not only appends the new samples to the graph but also updates the whole graph structure by discovering which nodes are affected by the introduction of new samples and by updating their edge weights.	Semantic Scholar
The second contribution of the article is the application of the proposed framework to the problem of graph-based label propagation using multiple observations for vision-based recognition tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on several image databases show that, without any significant loss in the accuracy of the final classification, the proposed dynamic graph construction is more efficient than the batch graph construction.	Semantic Scholar
Subspace clustering methods partition the data that lie in or close to a union of subspaces in accordance with the subspace structure.	Semantic Scholar
Such methods with sparsity prior, such as sparse subspace clustering (SSC) (Elhamifar and Vidal in IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell 35(11):2765–2781, 2013) with the sparsity induced by the $$\ell ^{1}$$ ℓ1 -norm, are demonstrated to be effective in subspace clustering.	Semantic Scholar
Most of those methods require certain assumptions, e.g.	Semantic Scholar
independence or disjointness, on the subspaces.	Semantic Scholar
However, these assumptions are not guaranteed to hold in practice and they limit the application of existing sparse subspace clustering methods.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose $$\ell ^{0}$$ ℓ0 -induced sparse subspace clustering ($$\ell ^{0}$$ ℓ0 -SSC).	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to the required assumptions, such as independence or disjointness, on subspaces for most existing sparse subspace clustering methods, we prove that $$\ell ^{0}$$ ℓ0 -SSC guarantees the subspace-sparse representation, a key element in subspace clustering, for arbitrary distinct underlying subspaces almost surely under the mild i.i.d.	Semantic Scholar
assumption on the data generation.	Semantic Scholar
We also present the “no free lunch” theorem which shows that obtaining the subspace representation under our general assumptions can not be much computationally cheaper than solving the corresponding $$\ell ^{0}$$ ℓ0 sparse representation problem of $$\ell ^{0}$$ ℓ0 -SSC.	Semantic Scholar
A novel approximate algorithm named Approximate $$\ell ^{0}$$ ℓ0 -SSC (A$$\ell ^{0}$$ ℓ0 -SSC) is developed which employs proximal gradient descent to obtain a sub-optimal solution to the optimization problem of $$\ell ^{0}$$ ℓ0 -SSC with theoretical guarantee.	Semantic Scholar
The sub-optimal solution is used to build a sparse similarity matrix upon which spectral clustering is performed for the final clustering results.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experimental results on various data sets demonstrate the superiority of A$$\ell ^{0}$$ ℓ0 -SSC compared to other competing clustering methods.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we extend $$\ell ^{0}$$ ℓ0 -SSC to semi-supervised learning by performing label propagation on the sparse similarity matrix learnt by A$$\ell ^{0}$$ ℓ0 -SSC and demonstrate the effectiveness of the resultant semi-supervised learning method termed $$\ell ^{0}$$ ℓ0 -sparse subspace label propagation ($$\ell ^{0}$$ ℓ0 -SSLP).

Cost-Sensitive Online Classification has drawn extensive attention in recent years, where the main approach is to directly online optimize two well-known cost-sensitive metrics: (i) weighted sum of sensitivity and specificity and (ii) weighted misclassification cost.	Semantic Scholar
However, previous existing methods only considered first-order information of data stream.	Semantic Scholar
It is insufficient in practice, since many recent studies have proved that incorporating second-order information enhances the prediction performance of classification models.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, we propose a family of cost-sensitive online classification algorithms with adaptive regularization in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
We theoretically analyze the proposed algorithms and empirically validate their effectiveness and properties in extensive experiments.	Semantic Scholar
Then, for better trade off between the performance and efficiency, we further introduce the sketching technique into our algorithms, which significantly accelerates the computational speed with quite slight performance loss.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we apply our algorithms to tackle several online anomaly detection tasks from real world.	Semantic Scholar
Promising results prove that the proposed algorithms are effective and efficient in solving cost-sensitive online classification problems in various real-world domains.	Semantic Scholar
Despite intensive investigations in the past, energetic efficiency is still one of the most important unsolved challenges in legged robot locomotion.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents an unconventional approach to the problem of energetically efficient legged locomotion by applying actuation for spring mass running.	Semantic Scholar
This approach makes use of mechanical springs incorporated in parallel with relatively low-torque actuation, which is capable of both accommodating large payload and locomotion with low power input by exploiting self-excited vibration.	Semantic Scholar
For a systematic analysis, this paper employs both simulation models and physical platforms.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments show that the proposed approach is scalable across different payload between 0 and 150 kg, and is able to achieve a total cost of transport of 0.10, which is significantly lower than the previous locomotion robots and most of the biological systems in the similar scale, when actuated with the near-to natural frequency with the maximum payload.

In this letter, we demonstrate a new robotic framework where a lightweight balloon with no onboard actuators or batteries acts as a mid-air robot that travels three-dimensionally within a workspace.	Semantic Scholar
The workspace contains five sparsely arranged ultrasound transducer arrays emitting steerable plane waves that cause acoustic radiation forces on the balloon and actuate it.	Semantic Scholar
The fabricated system performs a dynamic PID control of the movement of the balloon based on visual feedback.	Semantic Scholar
For practical operation of the system, we experimentally modeled the acoustic radiation force applied on a sphere.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the model, we developed the system dynamics model and a control law.	Semantic Scholar
We constructed a prototype system and demonstrated meter-scale three-dimensional manipulation of a 200 mm-diameter spherical object.	Semantic Scholar

In this letter, we present a data-driven method for scene parsing of road scenes to utilize single-channel near-infrared (NIR) images.	Semantic Scholar
To overcome the lack of data problem in non-RGB spectrum, we define a new color space and decompose the task of deep scene parsing into two subtasks with two separate CNN architectures for chromaticity channels and semantic masks.	Semantic Scholar
For chromaticity estimation, we build a spatially-aligned RGB-NIR image database (40k urban scenes) to infer color information from RGB-NIR spectrum learning process and leverage existing scene parsing networks trained over already available RGB masks.	Semantic Scholar
From our database, we sample key frames and manually annotate them (4k ground truth masks) to finetune the network into the proposed color space.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, the key contribution of this work is to replace multispectral scene parsing methods with a simple yet effective approach using single NIR images.	Semantic Scholar
The benefits of using our algorithm and dataset are confirmed in the qualitative and quantitative experiments.	Semantic Scholar
IBM ILOG CP Optimizer is a generic CP-based system to model and solve scheduling problems.	Semantic Scholar
It provides an algebraic language with simple mathematical concepts to capture the temporal dimension of scheduling problems in a combinatorial optimization framework.	Semantic Scholar
CP Optimizer implements a model-and-run paradigm that vastly reduces the burden on the user to understand CP or scheduling algorithms: modeling is by far the most important.	Semantic Scholar
The automatic search provides good performance out of the box and it is continuously improving.	Semantic Scholar

Recurrent neural network (RNN) and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) networks are the common go-to architecture for exploiting sequential information where the output is dependent on a sequence of inputs.	Semantic Scholar
However, in most considered problems, the dependencies typically lie in the latent domain which may not be suitable for applications involving the prediction of a step-wise transformation sequence that is dependent on the previous states only in the visible domain with a known terminal state.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a hybrid architecture of convolution neural networks (CNN) and stacked autoencoders (SAE) to learn a sequence of causal actions that nonlinearly transform an input visual pattern or distribution into a target visual pattern or distribution with the same support and demonstrated its practicality in a real-world engineering problem involving the physics of fluids.

The structured case representation improves case-based reasoning (CBR) by exploring structures in the case base and the relevance of case structures.	Semantic Scholar
Recent CBR classifiers have mostly been built upon the attribute-value case representation rather than structured case representation, in which the structural relations embodied in their representation structure are accordingly overlooked in improving the similarity measure.	Semantic Scholar
This results in retrieval inefficiency and limitations on the performance of CBR classifiers.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a hierarchical case-based classifier, HCBC, which introduces a concept lattice to hierarchically organize cases.	Semantic Scholar
By exploiting structural case relations in the concept lattice, a novel dynamic weighting model is proposed to enhance the concept similarity measure.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this similarity measure, HCBC retrieves the top-K concepts that are most similar to a new case by using a bottom-up pruning-based recursive retrieval (PRR) algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The concepts extracted in this way are applied to suggest a class label for the case by a weighted majority voting.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that HCBC outperforms other classifiers in terms of classification performance and robustness on categorical data, and also works confidently well on numeric datasets.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, PRR effectively reduces the search space and greatly improves the retrieval efficiency of HCBC.	Semantic Scholar
This paper addresses the simulation of the state of a discrete-time controlled cable-driven parallel robot (CDPR) with nondeformable or elastic cables over a given trajectory.	Semantic Scholar
Being given a CDPR, an arbitrary model for the coiling system and for the control strategy, we exhibit a simulation algorithm that allows one to determine, in a guaranteed way, the platform pose and the cable tensions at any time.	Semantic Scholar
We show that such a simulation may require a computing accuracy that imposes to use extended arithmetic and that discrete-time control may lead to drastic differences in the cable tensions as compared to usual continuous time simulation.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, the proposed simulation tool allows for a better estimation of the positioning accuracy together with safer estimation of the maximum of the cable tensions.	Semantic Scholar
Dropped head syndrome is often seen in patients with neurological disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	Semantic Scholar
Static collars are often prescribed to these patients to support their head.	Semantic Scholar
These collars support the head in one position but do not allow motion to the head.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a novel active neck brace to address this issue and provide assistance to the patients to improve their neck range of motion.	Semantic Scholar
This brace has three degrees-of-freedom and allows improved range of motion to the head and neck.	Semantic Scholar
We have developed a joystick interface for this brace to allow the user to carry out their intended head rotation with assistance of the brace.	Semantic Scholar
In order to assess the feasibility of the use of this brace, we present a study that recruited eight healthy subjects.	Semantic Scholar
We simultaneously recorded the motion of the head, electromyography of the neck muscles, and force/torque applied through the brace to the head.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that the brace provides support to the head and subjects activate their muscles less when assisted by the brace using the joystick.	Semantic Scholar
Supervised learning algorithms in a spiking neural network either learn a spike-train pattern for a single neuron receiving input spike-train from multiple input synapses or learn to output the first spike time in a feedforward network setting.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we build upon spike-event based weight update strategy to learn continuous spike-train in a spiking neural network with a hidden layer using a dead zone on-off based adaptive learning rate rule which ensures convergence of the learning process in the sense of weight convergence and robustness of the learning process to external disturbances.	Semantic Scholar
Based on different benchmark problems, we compare this new method with other relevant spike-train learning algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that the speed of learning is much improved and the rate of successful learning is also greatly improved.	Semantic Scholar
Markov localization and its variants are widely used for mobile robot localization.	Semantic Scholar
Thesemethods assume Markov independence of observations, implying that the observations can be entirely explained by a map.	Semantic Scholar
However, in real human environments, robots frequently make unexpected observations due to unmapped static objects like chairs and tables, and dynamic objects like humans.	Semantic Scholar
We therefore introduce Episodic non-Markov Localization (EnML), which reasons about theworld as consisting of three classes of objects: long-term features corresponding to permanent mapped objects, short-term features corresponding to unmapped static objects, and dynamic features corresponding to unmapped moving objects.	Semantic Scholar
Long-term features are represented by a static map, while short-term features are detected and tracked in real-time.	Semantic Scholar
To reason about unexpected observations and their correlations across poses, we augment the Dynamic Bayesian Network for Markov localization to include varying edges and nodes, resulting in a novel Varying Graphical Network representation.	Semantic Scholar
The maximum likelihood estimate of the belief is incrementally computed by non-linear functional optimization.	Semantic Scholar
By detecting timesteps along the robot’s trajectory where unmapped observations prior to such time steps are unrelated to those afterwards, EnML limits the history of observations and pose estimates to ‘‘episodes’’ over which the belief is computed.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate EnML using different types of sensors including laser rangefinders and depth cameras, and over multiple datasets, comparing it with alternative approaches.	Semantic Scholar
We further include results of a team of indoor autonomous service mobile robots traversing hundreds of kilometers using EnML.	Semantic Scholar

Since combining features from heterogeneous data sources can significantly boost classification performance in many applications, it has attracted much research attention over the past few years.	Semantic Scholar
Most of the existing multiview feature analysis approaches separately learn features in each view, ignoring knowledge shared by multiple views.	Semantic Scholar
Different views of features may have some intrinsic correlations that might be beneficial to feature learning.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, it is assumed that multiviews share subspaces from which common knowledge can be discovered.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a new multiview feature learning algorithm, aiming to exploit common features shared by different views.	Semantic Scholar
To achieve this goal, we propose a feature learning algorithm in a batch mode, by which the correlations among different views are taken into account.	Semantic Scholar
Multiple transformation matrices for different views are simultaneously learned in a joint framework.	Semantic Scholar
In this way, our algorithm can exploit potential correlations among views as supplementary information that further improves the performance result.	Semantic Scholar
Since the proposed objective function is nonsmooth and difficult to solve directly, we propose an iterative algorithm for effective optimization.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments have been conducted on a number of real-world data sets.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results demonstrate superior performance in terms of classification against all the compared approaches.	Semantic Scholar
Also, the convergence guarantee has been validated in the experiment.	Semantic Scholar
We present an evaluation of standard image features in the context of long-term visual teach-and-repeat navigation of mobile robots, where the environment exhibits significant changes in appearance caused by seasonal weather variations and daily illumination changes.	Semantic Scholar
We argue that for long-term autonomous navigation, the viewpoint-, scaleand rotationinvariance of the standard feature extractors is less important than their robustness to the midand longterm environment appearance changes.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we focus our evaluation on the robustness of image registration to variable lighting and naturally-occurring seasonal changes.	Semantic Scholar
We combine detection and description components of different image extractors and evaluate their performance on five datasets collected by mobile vehicles in three different outdoor environments over the course of one year.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we propose a trainable feature descriptor based on a combination of evolutionary algorithms and Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features, which we call GRIEF (Generated BRIEF).	Semantic Scholar
In terms of robustness to seasonal changes, the most promising results were achieved by the SpG/CNN and the STAR/GRIEF feature, which was slightly less robust, but faster to calculate.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we introduce the graph regularized autoencoder.	Semantic Scholar
We propose three variants.	Semantic Scholar

The second one is tailored for clustering, by incorporating subspace clustering terms into the autoencoder formulation.	Semantic Scholar
The third is a supervised label consistent autoencoder suitable for single label and multi-label classification problems.	Semantic Scholar
Each of these has been compared with the state-of-the-art on benchmark datasets.	Semantic Scholar
The problems addressed here are image denoising, clustering and classification.	Semantic Scholar

This study addresses the pre touch reaction distance effects in human–robot touch interaction with an android named ERICA that has a feminine, human-like appearance.	Semantic Scholar
Past studies on human–robot interaction, which enabled social robots to react to being touched by developing several sensing systems and designing reaction behaviors, focused on after-touch situations, i.e., before-touch situations received less attention.	Semantic Scholar

This paper considers the problem of embedding Knowledge Graphs (KGs) consisting of entities and relations into low-dimensional vector spaces.	Semantic Scholar
Most of the existing methods perform this task based solely on observed facts.	Semantic Scholar
The only requirement is that the learned embeddings should be compatible within each individual fact.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, aiming at further discovering the intrinsic geometric structure of the embedding space, we propose Semantically Smooth Embedding (SSE).	Semantic Scholar
The key idea of SSE is to take full advantage of additional semantic information and enforce the embedding space to be semantically smooth, i.e., entities belonging to the same semantic category will lie close to each other in the embedding space.	Semantic Scholar
Two manifold learning algorithms Laplacian Eigenmaps and Locally Linear Embedding are used to model the smoothness assumption.	Semantic Scholar
Both are formulated as geometrically based regularization terms to constrain the embedding task.	Semantic Scholar
Two lines of embedding strategies are tested, i.e., strategies based on latent distance models and strategies based on tensor factorization techniques.	Semantic Scholar
We empirically evaluate SSE on two benchmark tasks of link prediction and triple classification, and achieve significant and consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
The results demonstrate the superiority and generality of SSE.	Semantic Scholar
Area coverage is a fundamental task in robotics, where one or more robots are required to visit all points in a target area at least once.	Semantic Scholar
In many real-world scenarios, the need arises for protecting one’s territory from being covered by a robot, e.g., when we need to defend a building from being surveyed by an adversarial force.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, this paper discusses the problem of defending a given area from being covered by a robot.	Semantic Scholar
In this problem, the defender needs to choose the locations of k stationary guards in the target area, each one having some probability of capturing the robot, in a way that maximizes the probability of stopping the covering robot.	Semantic Scholar
We consider two types of covering robots: one that has an a-priori map of the environment, including the locations of the guards; and the other has no prior knowledge of the environment, and thus has to use real-time sensor measurements in order to detect the guards and plan its path according to their discovered locations.	Semantic Scholar
We show that in both cases the defender can exploit the target area’s topology, and specifically the vulnerability points in the area (i.e., places that must be visited by the robot more than once), in order to increase its chances of capturing the covering robot.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that although in general finding an optimal strategy for a defender with zero-knowledge on the robot’s coverage strategy is $${\mathcal {NP}}$$ NP -Hard, for certain values of k an optimal strategy can be found in polynomial time.	Semantic Scholar
For other cases we suggest heuristics that can significantly outperform the random baseline strategy.	Semantic Scholar
We provide both theoretical and empirical evaluation of our suggested algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a novel method to estimate the relative poses between RGB and depth cameras without the requirement of an overlapping field of view, thus providing flexibility to calibrate a variety of sensor configurations.	Semantic Scholar
This calibration problem is relevant to robotic applications that can benefit of using several cameras to increase the field of view.	Semantic Scholar
In our approach, we extract and match lines of the scene in the RGB and depth cameras, and impose geometric constraints to find the relative poses between the sensors.	Semantic Scholar
An analysis of the observability properties of the problem is presented.	Semantic Scholar
We have validated our method in both synthetic and real scenarios with different camera configurations, demonstrating that our approach achieves good accuracy and is very simple to apply, in contrast with previous methods based on trajectory matching using visual odometry or simultaneous localization and mapping.

As an important technique to solve distributed constraint optimization problems, Max-sum has drawn a lot of attention and successfully been deployed in real applications.	Semantic Scholar
Unfortunately, Max-sum fails to converge in cyclic problems and usually traverses states with low quality.	Semantic Scholar
Max-sum_AD and Max-sum_ADVP were proposed to guarantee the single phase convergence and the cross phase convergence respectively, and greatly improve the solution quality of Max-sum.	Semantic Scholar
However, the solution quality is closely related to the timing for starting value propagation in Max-sum_ADVP.	Semantic Scholar
In other words, low-quality initial assignments will lead to a poor result.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we prove that value propagation could restrict the exploration ability brought by Max-sum and eventually makes Max-sum_ADVP equivalent to a sequential greedy local search algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
For getting a balance between exploration and exploitation, several non-consecutive value propagation strategies are proposed to relax the restriction caused by value propagation: single-side value propagation which executes value propagation and Max-sum_AD in an interleaved way, probabilistic value propagation which performs value propagation stochastically and hybrid belief/value propagation where agents perform Max-sum_AD and value propagation in one round.	Semantic Scholar
We illustrate that agents in our algorithms can make decisions beyond local functions.	Semantic Scholar
Our empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our methods over Max-sum and its variants.	Semantic Scholar
It also can be found that our methods are independent of the value propagation timing which is a major concern in Max-sum_ADVP.	Semantic Scholar

Specifically, we use the notion of robust graphs to build resilient teams, and focus on the problem of designing robot formations with communication graphs (each edge models a bidirectional communication link) that are robust.	Semantic Scholar
We present algorithms to build robust graphs.	Semantic Scholar
Given a set of robots and the maximum number of malicious or malfunctioning robots, we are able to 1) state if it is possible to build a resilient team; 2) say what the proximity relationships that enable communication ought to be; 3) construct elemental resilient graphs; and 4) develop a framework for composing resilient teams to build larger resilient teams.

One of the most significant challenges of aerial–aquatic locomotion in mobile robots is finding a propulsion system that is capable of working effectively in both fluids and transitioning between them.	Semantic Scholar

Based on this analysis, we present a novel gearbox enabling an aerial propulsion system to operate efficiently underwater.	Semantic Scholar
This is achieved with minimal complexity using a single fixed pitch propeller system, which can change gear underwater by reversing the drive motor, but with the gearing arranged to leave the propeller direction unchanged.	Semantic Scholar
This system is then integrated into a small robot, and flights in air and locomotion underwater are demonstrated.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a parametric network generation model which we call network reconstruction model (NRM) for structural reconstruction of scale-free real networks with power-law exponent greater than 2 in the tail of its degree distribution.	Semantic Scholar

We propose a regrasping move, termed “IK-switch,” which allows efficiently bridging components of the configuration space that are otherwise mutually disconnected.	Semantic Scholar
This move, combined with several other developments, such as a method to stabilize the manipulated object using the environment, a new tree structure, and a compliant control scheme, enables us to address complex closed-chain manipulation tasks, such as flipping a chair frame, which is otherwise impossible to realize using existing multi-arm planning methods.	Semantic Scholar
In recent years, various data clustering algorithms have been proposed in the data mining and engineering communities.	Semantic Scholar
However, there are still drawbacks in traditional clustering methods which are worth to be further investigated, such as clustering for the high dimensional data, learning an ideal affinity matrix which optimally reveals the global data structure, discovering the intrinsic geometrical and discriminative properties of the data space, and reducing the noises influence brings by the complex data input.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a novel clustering algorithm called robust dual clustering with adaptive manifold regularization (RDC), which simultaneously performs dual matrix factorization tasks with the target of an identical cluster indicator in both of the original and projected feature spaces, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
"Among which, the <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$l_{2,1}$ </tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""zhang-ieq1-2732986.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula>-norm is used instead of the conventional <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$l_{2}$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""zhang-ieq2-2732986.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula>-norm to measure the loss, which helps to improve the model robustness by relieving the influences by the noises and outliers."	Semantic Scholar
In order to better consider the intrinsic geometrical and discriminative data structure, we incorporate the manifold regularization term on the cluster indicator by using a particularly learned affinity matrix which is more suitable for the clustering task.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, a novel augmented lagrangian method (ALM) based procedure is designed to effectively and efficiently seek the optimal solution of the proposed RDC optimization.	Semantic Scholar
Numerous experiments on the representative data sets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compares to the existing clustering algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
The paper investigates the variable structure control for stabilization of Boolean networks (BNs).	Semantic Scholar
The design of variable structure control consists of two steps: determine a switching condition and determine a control law.	Semantic Scholar
We first provide a method to choose states from the reaching mode.	Semantic Scholar
Using this method, we can guarantee that the number of nodes which should be controlled is minimized.	Semantic Scholar
According to the selected states, we determine the switching condition to guarantee that the time of global stabilization in the BN is the shortest.	Semantic Scholar
A control law is then determined to ensure that all selected states can enter into the sliding mode, such that any initial state can arrive in the steady-state mode.	Semantic Scholar
Some examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.	Semantic Scholar
Strategies for reducing fall-related injuries have been assessed through biomechanical studies and employed in robotics.	Semantic Scholar
A better understanding of the mechanism of such fall arresting methods can help fall prevention programs to reduce injuries and help robots to prevent damage to themselves.	Semantic Scholar
Rollover about the longitudinal axis is an effective strategy to reduce the impact force experienced by the hand and consequently reduce the associated injuries; however, neither biomechanical researchers nor roboticists have studied this useful fall arresting strategy.	Semantic Scholar
This study was designed to investigate the impact force experienced by the human hand during a forward fall using the longitudinal rollover strategy.	Semantic Scholar
We designed a series of fall experiments in which the subjects were instructed to arrest a forward fall using longitudinal rollover and bimanual strategies.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results showed that during a forward fall, longitudinal rollover considerably reduces the impact force and the risk of injuries.	Semantic Scholar
The kinematic data of motion were measured and presented.	Semantic Scholar
A comparison of our method with various forward fall arresting methods reported so far in the existing literature showed that our proposed fall arresting strategy is one of the most efficient techniques.	Semantic Scholar
Our study results are expected to provide robotics researchers with useful data to design algorithms to reduce robot damage during falls.	Semantic Scholar
We present a proof procedure for univariate real polynomial problems in Isabelle/HOL.	Semantic Scholar
The core mathematics of our procedure is based on univariate cylindrical algebraic decomposition.	Semantic Scholar
We follow the approach of untrusted certificates, separating solving from verifying: efficient external tools perform expensive real algebraic computations, producing evidence that is formally checked within Isabelle’s logic.	Semantic Scholar
This allows us to exploit highly-tuned computer algebra systems like Mathematica to guide our procedure without impacting the correctness of its results.	Semantic Scholar
We present experiments demonstrating the efficacy of this approach, in many cases yielding orders of magnitude improvements over previous methods.	Semantic Scholar
Multi-task clustering improves the clustering performance of each task by transferring knowledge across related tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Most existing multi-task clustering methods are based on the ideal assumption that the tasks are completely related.	Semantic Scholar
However, in real applications, the tasks are usually partially related.	Semantic Scholar
In these cases, brute-force transfer may cause negative effect which degrades the clustering performance.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose two multi-task clustering methods for partially related tasks: the self-adapted multi-task clustering (SAMTC) method and the manifold regularized coding multi-task clustering (MRCMTC) method, which can automatically identify and transfer related instances among the tasks, thus avoiding negative transfer.	Semantic Scholar
Both SAMTC and MRCMTC construct the similarity matrix for each target task by exploiting useful information from the source tasks through related instances transfer, and adopt spectral clustering to get the final clustering results.	Semantic Scholar
But, they learn the related instances from the source tasks in different ways.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on real data sets show the superiorities of the proposed algorithms over traditional single-task clustering methods and existing multi-task clustering methods on both completely and partially related tasks.	Semantic Scholar
The success of robots in real-world environments is largely dependent on their ability to interact with both humans and said environment.	Semantic Scholar
The FP7 EU project CoDyCo focused on the latter of these two challenges by exploiting both rigid and compliant contacts dynamics in the robot control problem.	Semantic Scholar
Regarding the former, to properly manage interaction dynamics on the robot control side, an estimation of the human behaviors and intentions is necessary.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present the building blocks of such a human-in-the-loop controller, and validate them in both simulation and on the iCub humanoid robot using a human–robot interaction scenario.	Semantic Scholar
In this scenario, a human assists the robot in standing up from being seated on a bench.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we present an efficient mathematical representation of soft robotic fingers based on screw theory.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we show how the model and its main properties can be exploited in the design phase, and we present an application for an underactuated tendon-driven gripper with a modular structure, in which the joint stiffness values are defined to obtain the desired equivalent stiffness and kinematics manipulability at the fingertips.	Semantic Scholar
A distribution of stiffness through the flexible parts of the gripper is fundamental to characterize its overall behavior: The introduced mathematical model enables the gripper designer to analyze how a specific property, e.g., a desired trajectory of the fingertips, a desired overall stiffness, a distribution of contact force, etc., is influenced by the stiffness of its passive joints, and vice-versa evaluating the joint stiffness values allowing to get a desired properties.	Semantic Scholar
Joints with different stiffness values can be obtained by regulating three-dimensional-printing parameters and material properties in the manufacturing process.	Semantic Scholar
It is possible to design modular grippers with the same mechanical structure, but different behaviours, i.e., different fingertip trajectories, equivalent fingertip stiffness ellipsoids etc.	Semantic Scholar
Gripper modules can be easily assembled and disassembled, maintaining the same base, to adapt them to different tasks.	Semantic Scholar
The presented model and design guidelines are a first step in the direction of soft grippers that can be optimized for a specific problem.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a viewpoint-invariant place recognition algorithm which is robust to changing environments while requiring only a small memory footprint.	Semantic Scholar
It demonstrates that condition-invariant local features can be combined with Vectors of Locally Aggregated Descriptors to reduce high-dimensional representations of images to compact binary signatures while retaining place matching capability across visually dissimilar conditions.	Semantic Scholar
This system provides a speed-up of two orders of magnitude over direct feature matching, and outperforms a bag-of-visual-words approach with near-identical computation speed and memory footprint.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results show that single-image place matching from nonaligned images can be achieved in visually changing environments with as few as 256 b (32 B) per image.	Semantic Scholar
This paper is concerned with the state estimation problem for a class of Markovian jumping neural networks (MJNNs) with sensor nonlinearities, mode-dependent time delays and stochastic disturbances subject to the Round-Robin (RR) scheduling mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
The system parameters experience switches among finite modes according to a Markov chain.	Semantic Scholar
As an equal allocation scheme, the RR communication protocol is introduced for efficient usage of limited bandwidth and energy saving.	Semantic Scholar
The update matrix method is adopted to deal with the periodic time-delays resulting from the RR protocol.	Semantic Scholar
The objective of the addressed problem is to construct a state estimator for the MJNNs such that the dynamics of the estimation error is exponentially ultimately bounded in the mean square with a certain upper bound.	Semantic Scholar
Sufficient conditions are established for the existence of the desired state estimator by resorting to a combination of the Lyapunov stability theory and the stochastic analysis technique.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the estimator gain matrices are characterized in terms of the solution to a convex optimization problem.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, a numerical simulation example is exploited to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimator design strategy.	Semantic Scholar

A <italic>Sequence OLAP</italic> (S-OLAP) system provides a platform on which pattern-based aggregate (PBA) queries on a sequence database are evaluated.	Semantic Scholar

Semantic Scholar
A pattern template is a sequence of variables, each is defined over a domain.	Semantic Scholar
Each variable is instantiated with all possible values in its corresponding domain to derive all possible patterns of the template.	Semantic Scholar
Sequences are grouped based on the patterns they possess.	Semantic Scholar
The answer to a PBA query is a <italic>sequence cuboid</italic> (s-cuboid), which is a multidimensional array of cells.	Semantic Scholar
Each cell is associated with a pattern instantiated from the query's pattern template.	Semantic Scholar

As people spend significant parts of daily lives indoors, it is useful and important to measure indoor densities and find the dense regions in many indoor scenarios like space management and security control.	Semantic Scholar

Such data is obtained by indoor positioning systems working at a relatively low frequency, and the reported locations in the data are discrete, from a preselected location set that does not continuously cover the entire indoor space.	Semantic Scholar
When a search is triggered, the object positioning information is already out-of-date and thus object locations are uncertain.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we first integrate object location uncertainty into the definitions for counting objects in an indoor region and computing its density.	Semantic Scholar
Subsequently, we conduct a thorough analysis of the location uncertainty in the context of complex indoor topology, deriving upper and lower bounds of indoor region densities and introducing distance decaying effect into computing concrete indoor densities.	Semantic Scholar
Enabled by the uncertainty analysis outcomes, we design efficient search algorithms for solving the problem.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we conduct extensive experimental studies on our proposals using synthetic and real data.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results verify that the proposed search approach is efficient, scalable, and effective.	Semantic Scholar

This paper presents a new method for calibrating the pose parameters between two coupled 6-axis F/T sensors.	Semantic Scholar
The pose parameters include translational and rotational parameters defining the full coordinate transformation between the F/T sensors.	Semantic Scholar
The sensor 1 was fixed mount in the robot’s flange and the sensor 2 was relocatable i.e.	Semantic Scholar
it was mounted arbitrarily on the last link of the robot after the wrist mount sensor.	Semantic Scholar
The novelty of our work is in the procedure for solving the translational pose parameters by means of contact point locations solved from systems of linear 3D-torque equations.	Semantic Scholar
In the calibration the operator exerts a series of diverging forces on the guiding handle which results in different amount of torque with respect to the coordinate frames of the F/T sensors depending on the respective contact point locations.	Semantic Scholar
The acquired forces and torques in the both sensor frames are input to the calibration function which outputs the full pose of the sensor 2 with respect to sensor 1.	Semantic Scholar
The influence of the sensor signal noise and the deviation of contact point location as well as unintended wrenching of the handle to the calibration accuracy were evaluated with numerical simulations in MATLAB.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of the calibration procedure was demonstrated with the real system including commercially available F/T sensors and medium sized industrial KUKA robot.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments verify the achievable calibration accuracy was in the level of ± 20 mm and ± 5 ° and in line with the simulation results.	Semantic Scholar
Episode Rule Mining is a popular framework for discovering sequential rules from event sequential data.	Semantic Scholar
However, traditional episode rule mining methods only tell that the consequent event is likely to happen within a given time interval after the occurrence of the antecedent events.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, they cannot satisfy the requirement of many time sensitive applications, such as program security trading and intelligent transportation management due to the lack of fine-grained response time.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we come up with the concept of fixed-gap episode to address this problem.	Semantic Scholar
A fixed-gap episode consists of an ordered set of events where the elapsed time between any two consecutive events is a constant.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this concept, we formulate the problem of mining  precise-positioning episode rules in which the occurrence time of each event in the consequent is clearly specified.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we develop a trie-based data structure to mine such precise-positioning episode rules with several pruning strategies incorporated for improving the performance as well as reducing memory consumption.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on real datasets show the superiority of our proposed algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Certain theoretical frameworks have successfully explained motor learning in either unimanual or bimanual movements.	Semantic Scholar
However, no single theoretical framework can comprehensively explain motor learning in both types of movement because the relationship between these two types of movement remains unclear.	Semantic Scholar
Although our recent model of a balanced motor primitive framework attempted to simultaneously explain motor learning in unimanual and bimanual movements, this model focused only on a limited subset of bimanual movements and therefore did not elucidate the relationships between unimanual movements and various bimanual movements.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we extend the balanced motor primitive framework to simultaneously explain motor learning in unimanual and various bimanual movements as well as the transfer of learning effects between unimanual and various bimanual movements; these phenomena can be simultaneously explained if the mean activity of each primitive for various unimanual movements is balanced with the corresponding mean activity for various bimanual movements.	Semantic Scholar
Using this balanced condition, we can reproduce the results of prior behavioral and neurophysiological experiments.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the balanced condition can be implemented in a simple neural network model.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a discrete switching controller for a realization of smooth pursuit.	Semantic Scholar
The human eye can produce both rapid and smooth movements, positioned by muscles that are a collection of quantized flexible motor units.	Semantic Scholar
From a control point of view, smooth pursuit can be considered as velocity matching control of an impulsive dynamical system.	Semantic Scholar
This may be feasible by a conventional pulsewidth modulation (PWM) controller; however, it causes high-frequency switching in each motor unit and may damage a compliant actuation system.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed controller generates reduced switching by optimizing a series of discrete switching commands at each primitive in an open-loop manner.	Semantic Scholar
This study uses a camera positioner driven by quantized compliant actuators and aims to match the velocity of a target object, while images are being captured to avoid motion blur.	Semantic Scholar
After images are obtained, the discrete switching controller suppresses residual vibrations to reduce switching further.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed discrete switching controller outperformed the classical PWM controller and successfully tracked an object of interest during an exposure window.	Semantic Scholar
In this work we propose a novel approach to perform segmentation by leveraging the abstraction capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).	Semantic Scholar
Our method is based on Hough voting, a strategy that allows for fully automatic localisation and segmentation of the anatomies of interest.	Semantic Scholar
This approach does not only use the CNN classification outcomes, but it also implements voting by exploiting the features produced by the deepest portion of the network.	Semantic Scholar
We show that this learning-based segmentation method is robust, multi-region, flexible and can be easily adapted to different modalities.	Semantic Scholar
In the attempt to show the capabilities and the behaviour of CNNs when they are applied to medical image analysis, we perform a systematic study of the performances of six different network architectures, conceived according to state-of-the-art criteria, in various situations.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate the impact of both different amount of training data and different data dimensionality (2D, 2.5D and 3D) on the final results.	Semantic Scholar

For smart factories in the Industry 4.0 era, edge devices can be used to run intelligent software packages (i.e., manufacturing services) to support manufacturing activities of production equipment.	Semantic Scholar
However, this kind of edge device may fail to provide designed functionalities in time when it encounters a sudden high-computation (SHC) job that cannot be executed by the edge device itself within a required time constraint.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, how to assure that an edge device can effectively execute SHC jobs so as to provide manufacturing services to equipment in time is an important and challenging issue for smart manufacturing.	Semantic Scholar
Exiting job-shop scheduling (JSS) methods may optimally allocate jobs for production lines but cannot directly be applied to handle the edge devices SHC jobs, which occur irregularly and are hard to specify processing time slots for JSS methods.	Semantic Scholar
Aimed at resolving the above-mentioned issue, this letter proposes a novel manufacturing-behavior-based map–reduce–style job offloading scheme.	Semantic Scholar
First, a distributed job processing architecture is designed to allow distributed edge devices to collaboratively complete an SHC job to support manufacturing.	Semantic Scholar
Next, a map–reduce–style program structure is developed so that an SHC job can be easily divided into multiple parts that can be executed in parallel by the selected edge devices, each device processing a part.	Semantic Scholar
Then, a mechanism of selecting proper edge devices to complete the SHC job, considering historical manufacturing behaviors of each edge device, is proposed for achieving high offloading efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we simulate a factory with 20 machines to conduct integrated tests.	Semantic Scholar
Testing results demonstrate the effectiveness and excellent performance of the proposed scheme.	Semantic Scholar
In order for robots to successfully carry out manipulation tasks, they require to exploit contact forces and variable impedance control.	Semantic Scholar
The conditions of such type of robotic tasks may significantly vary in dynamic environments, which demand robots to be endowed with adaptation capabilities.	Semantic Scholar
This can be achieved through learning methods that allow the robot not only to model a manipulation task but also to adapt to unseen situations.	Semantic Scholar
In this context, this paper proposes a learning-from-demonstration framework that integrates force sensing and variable impedance control to learn force-based variable stiffness skills.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach estimates full stiffness matrices from human demonstrations, which are then used along with the sensed forces to encode a probabilistic model of the task.	Semantic Scholar
This model is used to retrieve a time-varying stiffness profile that allows the robot to satisfactorily react to new task conditions.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed framework evaluates two different stiffness representations: Cholesky decomposition and a Riemannian manifold approach.	Semantic Scholar
We validate the proposed framework in simulation using 2D and 7D systems and a couple of real scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
We develop a computationally efficient approach for evaluating the information theoretic term within belief space planning (BSP) considering both unfocused and focused problem settings, where uncertainty reduction of the entire system or only of chosen variables is of interest, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
State-of-the-art approaches typically calculate, for each candidate action, the posterior information (or covariance) matrix and its determinant (required for entropy).	Semantic Scholar
In contrast, our approach reduces run-time complexity by avoiding these calculations, requiring instead a one-time calculation that depends on (the increasing with time) state dimensionality, and per-candidate calculations that are independent of the latter.	Semantic Scholar
To that end, we develop an augmented version of the matrix determinant lemma, and show computations can be reused when evaluating impact of different candidate actions.	Semantic Scholar
These two key ingredients result in a computationally efficient BSP approach that accounts for different sources of uncertainty and can be used with various sensing modalities.	Semantic Scholar
We examine the unfocused and focused instances of our approach, and compare it to the state of the art, in simulation and using real-world data, considering the problem of autonomous navigation in unknown environments.	Semantic Scholar
The two-dimensional Gabor function is adapted to natural image statistics, leading to a tractable probabilistic generative model that can be used to model simple cell receptive field profiles, or generate basis functions for sparse coding applications.	Semantic Scholar
Learning is found to be most pronounced in three Gabor function parameters representing the size and spatial frequency of the two-dimensional Gabor function and characterized by a nonuniform probability distribution with heavy tails.	Semantic Scholar
All three parameters are found to be strongly correlated, resulting in a basis of multiscale Gabor functions with similar aspect ratios and size-dependent spatial frequencies.	Semantic Scholar
A key finding is that the distribution of receptive-field sizes is scale invariant over a wide range of values, so there is no characteristic receptive field size selected by natural image statistics.	Semantic Scholar
The Gabor function aspect ratio is found to be approximately conserved by the learning rules and is therefore not well determined by natural image statistics.	Semantic Scholar
This allows for three distinct solutions: a basis of Gabor functions with sharp orientation resolution at the expense of spatial-frequency resolution, a basis of Gabor functions with sharp spatial-frequency resolution at the expense of orientation resolution, or a basis with unit aspect ratio.	Semantic Scholar
Arbitrary mixtures of all three cases are also possible.	Semantic Scholar
Two parameters controlling the shape of the marginal distributions in a probabilistic generative model fully account for all three solutions.	Semantic Scholar
The best-performing probabilistic generative model for sparse coding applications is found to be a gaussian copula with Pareto marginal probability density functions.	Semantic Scholar

Without knowledge of the absolute baseline between images, the scale of a map from a single-camera simultaneous localization and mapping system is subject to calamitous drift over time.	Semantic Scholar
We describe a monocular approach that in addition to point measurements also considers object detections to resolve this scale ambiguity and drift.	Semantic Scholar
By placing an expectation on the size of the objects, the scale estimation can be seamlessly integrated into a bundle adjustment.	Semantic Scholar
When object observations are available, the local scale of the map is then determined jointly with the camera pose in local adjustments.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike many previous visual odometry methods, our approach does not impose restrictions such as constant camera height or planar roadways, and is therefore more widely applicable.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our approach on the KITTI data set and show that it reduces scale drift over long-range outdoor sequences with a total length of 40 km.	Semantic Scholar
As the scale of objects is known absolutely, metric accuracy is obtained for all sequences.	Semantic Scholar
Qualitative evaluation is also performed on video footage from a hand-held camera.	Semantic Scholar
Business processes are prone to unexpected changes, as process workers may suddenly or gradually start executing a process differently in order to adjust to changes in workload, season, or other external factors.	Semantic Scholar
Early detection of business process changes enables managers to identify and act upon changes that may otherwise affect process performance.	Semantic Scholar
Business process drift detection refers to a family of methods to detect changes in a business process by analyzing event logs extracted from the systems that support the execution of the process.	Semantic Scholar
Existing methods for business process drift detection are based on an explorative analysis of a potentially large feature space and in some cases they require users to manually identify specific features that characterize the drift.	Semantic Scholar
Depending on the explored feature space, these methods miss various types of changes.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, they are either designed to detect sudden drifts or gradual drifts but not both.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes an automated and statistically grounded method for detecting sudden and gradual business process drifts under a unified framework.	Semantic Scholar
An empirical evaluation shows that the method detects typical change patterns with significantly higher accuracy and lower detection delay than existing methods, while accurately distinguishing between sudden and gradual drifts.	Semantic Scholar
Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a recent problem in computer vision and natural language processing that has garnered a large amount of interest from the deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing communities.	Semantic Scholar
In VQA, an algorithm needs to answer text-based questions about images.	Semantic Scholar
Since the release of the first VQA dataset in 2014, additional datasets have been released and many algorithms have been proposed.	Semantic Scholar
In this review, we critically examine the current state of VQA in terms of problem formulation, existing datasets, evaluation metrics, and algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we discuss the limitations of current datasets with regard to their ability to properly train and assess VQA algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
We then exhaustively review existing algorithms for VQA.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we discuss possible future directions for VQA and image understanding research.	Semantic Scholar
This letter reports on WaterGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for generating realistic underwater images from in-air image and depth pairings in an unsupervised pipeline used for color correction of monocular underwater images.	Semantic Scholar
Cameras onboard autonomous and remotely operated vehicles can capture high-resolution images to map the seafloor; however, underwater image formation is subject to the complex process of light propagation through the water column.	Semantic Scholar
The raw images retrieved are characteristically different than images taken in air due to effects, such as absorption and scattering, which cause attenuation of light at different rates for different wavelengths.	Semantic Scholar
While this physical process is well described theoretically, the model depends on many parameters intrinsic to the water column as well as the structure of the scene.	Semantic Scholar
These factors make recovery of these parameters difficult without simplifying assumptions or field calibration; hence, restoration of underwater images is a nontrivial problem.	Semantic Scholar
Deep learning has demonstrated great success in modeling complex nonlinear systems but requires a large amount of training data, which is difficult to compile in deep sea environments.	Semantic Scholar
Using WaterGAN, we generate a large training dataset of corresponding depth, in-air color images, and realistic underwater images.	Semantic Scholar
These data serve as input to a two-stage network for color correction of monocular underwater images.	Semantic Scholar
Our proposed pipeline is validated with testing on real data collected from both a pure water test tank and from underwater surveys collected in the field.	Semantic Scholar
Source code, sample datasets, and pretrained models are made publicly available.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents an approach to achieve adaptive grasp of unknown objects whose position is only approximately known via point-cloud data.	Semantic Scholar
We exploit the adaptability of a soft robotic hand which can autonomously conform to the shape of a grasped object if properly approached.	Semantic Scholar
Once a grasp approach has been preliminarily planned based only on rough estimates of the object position, the hand is shaped to a pregrasp configuration.	Semantic Scholar
Before closing the hand, a sensor-based algorithm is applied that corrects the relative hand-object posture so as to enhance the probability that the object is uniformly approached by all fingers, thus avoiding undesired premature contacts.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm minimizes the distance between the hand's fingerpads and the object by continuously controlling both the wrist pose and orientation and the hand closure.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental studies with a Kuka-LWR arm and a Pisa/IIT Softhand illustrate the benefit of the developed technique and the improvement in grasping performance with respect to open-loop execution of grasps planned on the basis of prior RGB-D cues only.	Semantic Scholar
Discrete optimization is a central problem in artificial intelligence.	Semantic Scholar
The optimization of the aggregated cost of a network of cost functions arises in a variety of problems including Weighted Constraint Programs (WCSPs), Distributed Constraint Optimization (DCOP), as well as optimization in stochastic variants such as the tasks of finding the most probable explanation (MPE) in belief networks.	Semantic Scholar
Inference-based algorithms are powerful techniques for solving discrete optimization problems, which can be used independently or in combination with other techniques.	Semantic Scholar
However, their applicability is often limited by their compute intensive nature and their space requirements.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes the design and implementation of a novel inference-based technique, which exploits modern massively parallel architectures, such as those found in Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), to speed up the resolution of exact and approximated inference-based algorithms for discrete optimization.	Semantic Scholar
The paper studies the proposed algorithm in both centralized and distributed optimization contexts.	Semantic Scholar
The paper demonstrates that the use of GPUs provides significant advantages in terms of runtime and scalability, achieving up to two orders of magnitude in speedups and showing a considerable reduction in execution time (up to 345 times faster) with respect to a sequential version.	Semantic Scholar
Manual spatio-temporal annotation of human action in videos is laborious, requires several annotators and contains human biases.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a weakly supervised approach to automatically obtain spatio-temporal annotations of an actor in action videos.	Semantic Scholar
We first obtain a large number of action proposals in each video.	Semantic Scholar
To capture a few most representative action proposals in each video and evade processing thousands of them, we rank them using optical flow and saliency in a 3D-MRF based framework and select a few proposals using MAP based proposal subset selection method.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate that this ranking preserves the high quality action proposals.	Semantic Scholar
Several such proposals are generated for each video of the same action.	Semantic Scholar
Our next challenge is to iteratively select one proposal from each video so that all proposals are globally consistent.	Semantic Scholar
We formulate this as Generalized Maximum Clique Graph problem using shape, global and fine grained similarity of proposals across the videos.	Semantic Scholar
The output of our method is the most action representative proposals from each video.	Semantic Scholar
Our method can also annotate multiple instances of the same action in a video.	Semantic Scholar
We have validated our approach on three challenging action datasets: UCF Sport, subJHMDB and THUMOS’13 and have obtained promising results compared to several baseline methods.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, on UCF Sports, we demonstrate that action classifiers trained on these automatically obtained spatio-temporal annotations have comparable performance to the classifiers trained on ground truth annotation.	Semantic Scholar
We present VideoLSTM for end-to-end sequence learning of actions in video.	Semantic Scholar
Rather than adapting the video to the peculiarities of established recurrent or convolutional architectures, we adapt the architecture to fit the requirements of the video medium.	Semantic Scholar

First, video has a spatial layout.	Semantic Scholar
To exploit the spatial correlation we hardwire convolutions in the soft-Attention LSTM architecture.	Semantic Scholar
Second, motion not only informs us about the action content, but also guides better the attention towards the relevant spatio-temporal locations.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce motion-based attention.	Semantic Scholar
And finally, we demonstrate how the attention from VideoLSTM can be exploited for action localization by relying on the action class label and temporal attention smoothing.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on UCF101, HMDB51 and THUMOS13 reveal the benefit of the video-specific adaptations of VideoLSTM in isolation as well as when integrated in a combined architecture.	Semantic Scholar
It compares favorably against other LSTM architectures for action classification and especially action localization.	Semantic Scholar
Understanding when and how computational complexity can be used to protect elections against different manipulative actions has been a highly active research area over the past two decades.	Semantic Scholar
Much of this literature, however, makes the assumption that the voters or agents specify a complete preference ordering over the set of candidates.	Semantic Scholar
There are many multiagent systems applications, and even real-world elections, where this assumption is not warranted, and this in turn raises a series of questions on the impact of partial voting on the complexity of manipulative actions.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we focus on two of these questions.	Semantic Scholar
First, we address the question of how hard it is to manipulate elections when the agents specify only top-truncated ballots.	Semantic Scholar
Here, in particular, we look at the weighted manipulation problem—both constructive and destructive manipulation—when the voters are allowed to specify top-truncated ballots, and we provide general results for all scoring rules, for elimination versions of all scoring rules, for the plurality with runoff rule, for a family of election systems known as Copeland $$^{\alpha }$$ α , and for the maximin protocol.	Semantic Scholar
The second question we address is the impact of top-truncated voting on the complexity of manipulative actions in electorates with structured preference profiles.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we consider electorates that are single-peaked and we show how, for many voting protocols, allowing top-truncated voting reimposes the $$\mathcal {NP}$$ NP -hardness shields that normally vanish in such electorates.	Semantic Scholar
Micro aerial vehicles have the potential to assist humans in tasks such as manipulation and transportation for construction and humanitarian missions, beyond simply acquiring data and building maps.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we address the state estimation, control, and trajectory planning in cooperative transportation of structures, which are either too heavy or too big to be carried by small microvehicles.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we consider small quadrotors, each equipped only with a single camera and inertial measurement unit as a sensor.	Semantic Scholar
The key contributions are 1) a new approach to coordinated control, which allows independent control of each vehicle while guaranteeing the system's stability and 2) a new cooperative localization scheme that allows each vehicle to benefit from measurements acquired by other vehicles.	Semantic Scholar
The latter relies on the vehicles exploiting the inherent rigid structure information to infer additional constraints between the vehicles’ poses allowing us to formulate the pose estimation problem as an optimization problem on the Lie group $\mathbf {SE(3)}$.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach is validated through experimental results with multiple quadrotors grasping and transporting a rigid structure.	Semantic Scholar
Joint clustering of multiple networks has been shown to be more accurate than performing clustering on individual networks separately.	Semantic Scholar
This is because multi-network clustering algorithms typically assume there is a common clustering structure shared by all networks, and different networks can provide compatible and complementary information for uncovering this underlying clustering structure.	Semantic Scholar
However, this assumption is too strict to hold in many emerging applications, where multiple networks usually have diverse data distributions.	Semantic Scholar
More popularly, the networks in consideration belong to different underlying groups.	Semantic Scholar
Only networks in the same underlying group share similar clustering structures.	Semantic Scholar
Better clustering performance can be achieved by considering such groups differently.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, an ideal method should be able to automatically detect network groups so that networks in the same group share a common clustering structure.	Semantic Scholar
To address this problem, we propose a new method, ComClus, to simultaneously group and cluster multiple networks.	Semantic Scholar
ComClus is novel in combining the clustering approach of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and the feature subspace learning approach of metric learning.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, it treats node clusters as features of networks and learns proper subspaces from such features to differentiate different network groups.	Semantic Scholar
During the learning process, the two procedures of network grouping and clustering are coupled and mutually enhanced.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, ComClus can effectively leverage prior knowledge on how to group networks such that network grouping can be conducted in a semi-supervised manner.	Semantic Scholar
This will enable users to guide the grouping process using domain knowledge so that network clustering accuracy can be further boosted.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experimental evaluations on a variety of synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
Possible world has shown to be effective for handling various types of data uncertainty in uncertain data management.	Semantic Scholar
However, few uncertain data clustering and classification algorithms are proposed based on possible world.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, existing possible world based algorithms suffer from the following issues: (1) they deal with each possible world independently and ignore the consistency principle across different possible worlds; (2) they require the extra post-processing procedure to obtain the final result, which causes that the effectiveness highly relies on the post-processing method and the efficiency is also not very good.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a novel possible world based consistency learning model for uncertain data, which can be extended both for clustering and classifying uncertain data.	Semantic Scholar
This model utilizes the consistency principle to learn a consensus affinity matrix for uncertain data, which can make full use of the information across different possible worlds and then improve the clustering and classification performance.	Semantic Scholar
Meanwhile, this model imposes a new rank constraint on the Laplacian matrix of the consensus affinity matrix, thereby ensuring that the number of connected components in the consensus affinity matrix is exactly equal to the number of classes.	Semantic Scholar
This also means that the clustering and classification results can be directly obtained without any post-processing procedure.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, for the clustering and classification tasks, we respectively derive the efficient optimization methods to solve the proposed model.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on real benchmark datasets and real world uncertain datasets show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art uncertain data clustering and classification algorithms in effectiveness and performs competitively in efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
Social networking services have been prevalent at many online communities such as Twitter.com and Weibo.com, where millions of users keep interacting with each other every day.	Semantic Scholar
One interesting and important problem in the social networking services is to rank users based on their vitality in a timely fashion.	Semantic Scholar
An accurate ranking list of user vitality could benefit many parties in social network services such as the ads providers and site operators.	Semantic Scholar
Although it is very promising to obtain a vitality-based ranking list of users, there are many technical challenges due to the large scale and dynamics of social networking data.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a unique perspective to achieve this goal, which is quantifying user vitality by analyzing the dynamic interactions among users on social networks.	Semantic Scholar
Examples of social network include but are not limited to social networks in microblog sites and academical collaboration networks.	Semantic Scholar
Intuitively, if a user has many interactions with his friends within a time period and most of his friends do not have many interactions with their friends simultaneously, it is very likely that this user has high vitality.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this idea, we develop quantitative measurements for user vitality and propose our first algorithm for ranking users based vitality.	Semantic Scholar
Also, we further consider the mutual influence between users while computing the vitality measurements and propose the second ranking algorithm, which computes user vitality in an iterative way.	Semantic Scholar
Other than user vitality ranking, we also introduce a vitality prediction problem, which is also of great importance for many applications in social networking services.	Semantic Scholar
Along this line, we develop a customized prediction model to solve the vitality prediction problem.	Semantic Scholar
To evaluate the performance of our algorithms, we collect two dynamic social network data sets.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results with both data sets clearly demonstrate the advantage of our ranking and prediction methods.	Semantic Scholar
Miniature robots manipulated by external magnetic fields could enable less invasive surgeries.	Semantic Scholar
Magnetic tools, capsules, or medication can be controlled inside a human body using electromagnets.	Semantic Scholar
However, resistive magnetic devices able to produce strong magnetic fields in a large volume inefficiently use space and energy.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents the design and testing of a magnetic manipulator cooled with liquid nitrogen.	Semantic Scholar
This technique reduces the electrical resistance of copper wires.	Semantic Scholar
It, therefore, reduces the amount of heat generated to produce a given magnetic field.	Semantic Scholar
Liquid nitrogen-cooled electromagnets are smaller than air-cooled ones and use less power.	Semantic Scholar
This letter examines how both effects scale with the size of the workspace.	Semantic Scholar
The system presented possesses six electromagnets and its ability to control a robot is demonstrated experimentally.	Semantic Scholar
Previous studies have shown that spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) can be used in spiking neural networks (SNN) to extract visual features of low or intermediate complexity in an unsupervised manner.	Semantic Scholar
These studies, however, used relatively shallow architectures, and only one layer was trainable.	Semantic Scholar
Another line of research has demonstrated - using rate-based neural networks trained with back-propagation - that having many layers increases the recognition robustness, an approach known as deep learning.	Semantic Scholar
We thus designed a deep SNN, comprising several convolutional (trainable with STDP) and pooling layers.	Semantic Scholar
We used a temporal coding scheme where the most strongly activated neurons fire first, and less activated neurons fire later or not at all.	Semantic Scholar
The network was exposed to natural images.	Semantic Scholar
Thanks to STDP, neurons progressively learned features corresponding to prototypical patterns that were both salient and frequent.	Semantic Scholar
Only a few tens of examples per category were required and no label was needed.	Semantic Scholar
After learning, the complexity of the extracted features increased along the hierarchy, from edge detectors in the first layer to object prototypes in the last layer.	Semantic Scholar
Coding was very sparse, with only a few thousands spikes per image, and in some cases the object category could be reasonably well inferred from the activity of a single higher-order neuron.	Semantic Scholar
More generally, the activity of a few hundreds of such neurons contained robust category information, as demonstrated using a classifier on Caltech 101, ETH-80, and MNIST databases.	Semantic Scholar
We also demonstrate the superiority of STDP over other unsupervised techniques such as random crops (HMAX) or auto-encoders.	Semantic Scholar
Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of STDP with latency coding may be a key to understanding the way that the primate visual system learns, its remarkable processing speed and its low energy consumption.	Semantic Scholar
These mechanisms are also interesting for artificial vision systems, particularly for hardware solutions.	Semantic Scholar
The powered exoskeleton race in Cybathlon 2016 consisted of six challenging tasks that required a pilot with complete paraplegia to walk on a level floor, uphill, downhill, and on stairs; stand up and sit down; step on stones; and even pass through a tilted path.	Semantic Scholar
All of these tasks addressed exactly the requirements for a powered exoskeleton designed to assist with activities of daily living (ADL) for paraplegics.	Semantic Scholar
Every team brought unique technologies to achieve this goal.	Semantic Scholar

In this paper, we developed a kinematic model for a legged piezoelectric miniature robot driven by standing wave.	Semantic Scholar
The robot consists of a piezoelectric bending actuator with rigidly attached legs.	Semantic Scholar
The kinematic model allows us to compute the velocity analytically so that the robot motion can be predicted.	Semantic Scholar
To construct the kinematic model, the behavior of the robot at the contact instances with the ground during the up and down stages is studied.	Semantic Scholar
A prototype is fabricated so as to verify our kinematic model experimentally, measured using a motion capture system.	Semantic Scholar
The result shows that the measured speed was in close agreement with what was predicted by our model.	Semantic Scholar
Generally, the performance of a generic detector decreases significantly when it is tested on a specific scene due to the large variation between the source training dataset and the samples from the target scene.	Semantic Scholar
To solve this problem, we propose a new formalism of transfer learning based on the theory of a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) filter to automatically specialize a scene-specific Faster R-CNN detector.	Semantic Scholar
The suggested framework uses different strategies based on the SMC filter steps to approximate iteratively the target distribution as a set of samples in order to specialize the Faster R-CNN detector towards a target scene.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we put forward a likelihood function that combines spatio-temporal information extracted from the target video sequence and the confidence-score given by the output layer of the Faster R-CNN, to favor the selection of target samples associated with the right label.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness of the suggested framework is demonstrated through experiments on several public traffic datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Compared with the state-of-the-art specialization frameworks, the proposed framework presents encouraging results for both single and multi-traffic object detections.	Semantic Scholar
Recently telecom fraud has become a serious problem especially in developing countries such as China.	Semantic Scholar
At present, it can be very difficult to coordinate different agencies to prevent fraud completely.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we study how to detect large transfers that are sent from victims deceived by fraudsters at the receiving bank.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a new generative adversarial network (GAN) based model to calculate for each large transfer a probability that it is fraudulent, such that the bank can take appropriate measures to prevent potential fraudsters to take the money if the probability exceeds a threshold.	Semantic Scholar
The inference model uses a deep denoising autoencoder to effectively learn the complex probabilistic relationship among the input features, and employs adversarial training that establishes a minimax game between a discriminator and a generator to accurately discriminate between positive samples and negative samples in the data distribution.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the model outperforms a set of well-known classification methods in experiments, and its applications in two commercial banks have reduced losses of about 10 million RMB in twelve weeks and significantly improved their business reputation.	Semantic Scholar
Network reliability is a well-studied problem that requires to measure the probability that a target node is reachable from a source node in a probabilistic (or uncertain) graph, i.e., a graph where every edge is assigned a probability of existence.	Semantic Scholar
Many approaches and problem variants have been considered in the literature, with the majority of them assuming that edge-existence probabilities are fixed.	Semantic Scholar
Nevertheless, in real-world graphs, edge probabilities typically depend on external conditions.	Semantic Scholar
In metabolic networks, a protein can be converted into another protein with some probability depending on the presence of certain enzymes.	Semantic Scholar
In social influence networks, the probability that a tweet of some user will be re-tweeted by her followers depends on whether the tweet contains specific hashtags.	Semantic Scholar
In transportation networks, the probability that a network segment will work properly or not, might depend on external conditions such as weather or time of the day.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we overcome this limitation and focus on <italic>conditional reliability</italic>, that is, assessing reliability when edge-existence probabilities depend on a set of conditions.	Semantic Scholar
"In particular, we study the problem of determining the top-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""khan-ieq1-2816653.gif""/> </alternatives></inline-formula> conditions that maximize the reliability between two nodes."	Semantic Scholar

We then devise a practical method that targets both accuracy and efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
We also study natural generalizations of the problem with multiple source and target nodes.	Semantic Scholar
An extensive empirical evaluation on several large, real-life graphs demonstrates effectiveness and scalability of our methods.	Semantic Scholar
Elderly or disabled people usually need augmented nursing attention both in home and clinical environments, especially to perform bathing activities.	Semantic Scholar
The development of an assistive robotic bath system, which constitutes a central motivation of this letter, would increase the independence and safety of this procedure, ameliorating in this way the everyday life for this group of people.	Semantic Scholar
In general terms, the main goal of this letter is to enable natural, physical human–robot interaction, involving human-friendly and user-adaptive online robot motion planning and interaction control.	Semantic Scholar
For this purpose, we employ imitation learning using a leader–follower framework called coordinate change dynamic movement primitives (CC-DMP), in order to incorporate the expertise of professional carers for bathing sequences.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a vision-based washing system, combining CC-DMP framework with a perception-based controller, to adapt the motion of robot's end effector on moving and deformable surfaces, such as a human body part.	Semantic Scholar
The controller guarantees globally uniformly asymptotic convergence to the leader movement primitive while ensuring avoidance of restricted areas, such as sensitive skin body areas.	Semantic Scholar
We experimentally tested our approach on a setup including the humanoid robot ARMAR-III and a Kinect v2 camera.	Semantic Scholar
The robot executes motions learned from the publicly available KIT whole-body human motion database, achieving good tracking performance in challenging interactive task scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
Environmental sustainability research is dependent on accurate land cover information.	Semantic Scholar
Even with the increased number of satellite systems and sensors acquiring data with improved spectral, spatial, radiometric and temporal characteristics and the new data distribution policy, most existing land cover datasets are derived from a pixel-based, single-date multi-spectral remotely sensed image with an unacceptable accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
One major bottleneck for accuracy improvement is how to develop an accurate and effective image classification protocol.	Semantic Scholar
By incorporating and utilizing multi-spectral, multi-temporal and spatial information in remote sensing images and considering the inherit spatial and sequential interdependence among neighboring pixels, we propose a new patch-based recurrent neural network (PB-RNN) system tailored for classifying multi-temporal remote sensing data.	Semantic Scholar
The system is designed by incorporating distinctive characteristics of multi-temporal remote sensing data.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, it uses multi-temporal-spectral-spatial samples and deals with pixels contaminated by clouds/shadow present in multi-temporal data series.	Semantic Scholar
Using a Florida Everglades ecosystem study site covering an area of 771 square kilometers, the proposed PB-RNN system has achieved a significant improvement in the classification accuracy over a pixel-based recurrent neural network (RNN) system, a pixel-based single-image neural network (NN) system, a pixel-based multi-image NN system, a patch-based single-image NN system, and a patch-based multi-image NN system.	Semantic Scholar
For example, the proposed system achieves 97.21% classification accuracy while the pixel-based single-image NN system achieves 64.74%.	Semantic Scholar
By utilizing methods like the proposed PB-RNN one, we believe that much more accurate land cover datasets can be produced over large areas.	Semantic Scholar
Planar and flexible climbing robots suffer from buckling while climbing on a vertical surface.	Semantic Scholar
This paper analyzes two different modes: one-end free buckling and two-ends fixed buckling.	Semantic Scholar
As an example for buckling analyses, the paper focuses on an electrostatic climbing robot that features thin body.	Semantic Scholar
As the body of the robot has only 2.5 mm of thickness, it is more prone to buckling than any other flexible robots, making it the best example for the buckling problem.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the analyses, the paper proposes a buckling-free control strategy for the electrostatic robots.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed strategy guarantees the force balance between adhesive force and weight force, as well as the elastic stability of the robot.	Semantic Scholar
To implement the strategy, the paper investigates the available region of the proper forces and optimal parameters on the prototype robot.	Semantic Scholar
A prototype of climbing robot was developed to verify the analyses and solutions, weighing merely 29 g (excluding battery and control circuits).	Semantic Scholar
It successfully climbed up a vertical wall without buckling, carrying the payload of 0.4 N.	Semantic Scholar
With the deployment of collaborative robots in intelligent manufacturing, object hand-over between humans and robots plays a significant role in human–robot collaborations.	Semantic Scholar
In most collaboration studies, human hand-over intentions were usually assumed to be known by the robot, and the research mainly focused on robot motion planning and control during the hand-over process.	Semantic Scholar
Several approaches have been developed to control the human–robot hand-over, such as vision-based approach and physical contact-based approach, but their applications in manufacturing environments are limited due to various constraints, such as limited human working ranges and safety concerns.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we develop a practical approach using a wearable sensory system, which has a natural and simple configuration and can be easily utilized by humans.	Semantic Scholar
This approach could make a robot recognize a human's hand-over intentions and enable the human to effectively and naturally control the hand-over process.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the approach could recognize the attribute classes of the objects in the human's hand using the wearable sensing and enable the robot to actively make decisions to ensure that graspable objects are handed over from the human to the robot.	Semantic Scholar
Results and evaluations illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach in human–robot hand-over control.	Semantic Scholar
We present a dense volumetric simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) framework that uses an octree representation for efficient fusion and rendering of either a truncated signed distance field (TSDF) or an occupancy map.	Semantic Scholar
The primary aim of this letter is to use one single representation of the environment that can be used not only for robot pose tracking and high-resolution mapping, but seamlessly for planning.	Semantic Scholar
We show that our highly efficient octree representation of space fits SLAM and planning purposes in a real-time control loop.	Semantic Scholar
In a comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate dense SLAM accuracy and runtime performance on-par with flat hashing approaches when using TSDF-based maps, and considerable speed-ups when using occupancy mapping compared to standard occupancy maps frameworks.	Semantic Scholar
Our SLAM system can run at 10–40 Hz on a modern quadcore CPU, without the need for massive parallelization on a GPU.	Semantic Scholar
We, furthermore, demonstrate a probabilistic occupancy mapping as an alternative to TSDF mapping in dense SLAM and show its direct applicability to online motion planning, using the example of informed rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT$^*$).	Semantic Scholar
Slip detection helps to prevent robotic hands from dropping grasped objects and would thus enable complex object manipulation.	Semantic Scholar
Here we present a method of detecting slip with a biomimetic optical tactile sensor—the TacTip—that operates by measuring the positions of internal pins embedded in its compliant skin.	Semantic Scholar
We investigate whether local pin movement is a strong signal of slip.	Semantic Scholar
Accurate and robust discrimination between static and slipping objects is obtained with a support vector machine (accuracy 99.88%).	Semantic Scholar
We then demonstrate performance on a task in which a slipping object must be caught.	Semantic Scholar
For fast reaction times, a modified TacTip is made for high-speed data collection.	Semantic Scholar
Performance of the slip detection method is then validated under several test conditions, including varying the speed at which slip onset occurs and using novel shaped objects.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed methods should apply to tactile sensors that can detect the local velocities of surface movement.	Semantic Scholar
The sensor and slip detection methods are also well-suited for integration onto robotic hands for deploying slip control under manipulation.	Semantic Scholar
Trustworthiness is a comprehensive quality metric which is used to assess the quality of the services in service-oriented environments.	Semantic Scholar
However, trust prediction of cloud services based on the multi-faceted Quality of Service (QoS) attributes is a challenging task due to the complicated and non-linear relationships between the QoS values and the corresponding trust result.	Semantic Scholar
Recent research works reveal the significance of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and its variants in providing a reasonable degree of success in trust prediction problems.	Semantic Scholar
However, the challenges with respect to weight assignment, training time and kernel functions make ANN and its variants under continuous advancements.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, this work presents a novel multi-level Hypergraph Coarsening based Robust Heteroscedastic Probabilistic Neural Network (HC-RHRPNN) to predict trustworthiness of cloud services to build high-quality service applications.	Semantic Scholar
HC-RHRPNN employs hypergraph coarsening to identify the informative samples, which were then used to train HRPNN to improve its prediction accuracy and minimize the runtime.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of HC-RHRPNN was evaluated using Quality of Web Service (QWS) dataset, a public QoS dataset in terms of classifier accuracy, precision, recall, and F-Score.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we focus on fully automatic traffic surveillance camera calibration, which we use for speed measurement of passing vehicles.	Semantic Scholar
We improve over a recent state-ofthe-art camera calibration method for traffic surveillance based on two detected vanishing points.	Semantic Scholar
More importantly, we propose a novel automatic scene scale inference method.	Semantic Scholar
The method is based on matching bounding boxes of rendered 3D models of vehicles with detected bounding boxes in the image.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method can be used from arbitrary viewpoints, since it has no constraints on camera placement.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our method on the recent comprehensive dataset for speed measurement BrnoCompSpeed.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments show that our automatic camera calibration method by detection of two vanishing points reduces error by 50 % (mean distance ratio error reduced from 0.18 to 0.09) compared to the previous state-of-the-art method.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that our scene scale inference method is more precise, outperforming both state-of-the-art automatic calibration method for speed measurement (error reduction by 86 % – 7.98 km/h to 1.10 km/h) and manual calibration (error reduction by 19 % – 1.35 km/h to 1.10 km/h).	Semantic Scholar
We also present qualitative results of the proposed automatic camera calibration method on video sequences obtained from real surveillance cameras in various places, and under different lighting conditions (night, dawn, day).	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, active tactile exploration for object shape estimation is explored.	Semantic Scholar
A prior work suggested to touch the most uncertain part of the estimated shape for minimizing the required number of touches.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, it is pointed out that it may not be the best approach for fast estimation.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel criterion in active touch point selection for fast estimation, which considers both uncertainty of shape estimation and travel cost to touch.	Semantic Scholar
Our method employs a Gaussian process implicit surface model to learn the object shape from tactile information, which allows us to evaluate the uncertainty of the shape estimation with an analytic form.	Semantic Scholar
To estimate the travel costs for all the touch candidates, our method utilizes a computationally-efficient graph-based path planning method based on stochastic optimal control theory.	Semantic Scholar
Simulationswith 2D and 3Dobjects and real-robot experimentswith a 7DOF robot arm and a single finger device equipped with a tactile sensor are conducted.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results verify the effectiveness of ourmethod for fast tactile object shape estimation as compared to passive exploration and active exploration that touches the most uncertain part of the estimated shape.	Semantic Scholar

Deep learning algorithms achieve human-level (or better) performance on many tasks, but there still remain situations where humans learn better or faster.	Semantic Scholar
With regard to classification of images, we argue that some of those situations are because the human visual system represents information in a format that promotes good training and classification.	Semantic Scholar
To demonstrate this idea, we show how occluding objects can impair performance of a deep learning system that is trained to classify digits in the MNIST database.	Semantic Scholar
We describe a human inspired segmentation and interpolation algorithm that attempts to reconstruct occluded parts of an image, and we show that using this reconstruction algorithm to pre-process occluded images promotes training and classification performance.	Semantic Scholar

Tactile information has been largely exploited for object recognition with robotic hands but very few approaches have used proprioception alone.	Semantic Scholar
In those that do, raw values of joint angles or torques are exploited to train learning algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
However, these approaches under-exploit the potential of proprioception, such as its usefulness to estimate the object pose and size.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, they focus on recognizing individual objects, which increases the amount of data needed to train the algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present an approach based only on joint angles of a robotic hand to generate a shape proprioceptive signature that is invariant to the size and position of the object.	Semantic Scholar
Instead of recognizing a specific object from a list, object characteristics useful for its manipulation are extracted.	Semantic Scholar
This signature is exploited not only for shape recognition but also for pose estimation.	Semantic Scholar
To illustrate the scope of this method, tests are performed on primitive shapes.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that the signatures are invariant within large ranges of sizes and poses.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on real hand were carried, and results depicted that the method works similarly in both simulated environment and real applications.	Semantic Scholar
A comparison between this two results is made and discussed.	Semantic Scholar

We demonstrate the value of our synthesized dataset, by improving performance in certain machine-learning-based scene understanding tasks—depth and surface normal prediction, semantic segmentation, reconstruction, etc.—and by providing benchmarks for and diagnostics of trained models by modifying object attributes and scene properties in a controllable manner.

The class imbalance problem in machine learning occurs when certain classes are underrepresented relative to the others, leading to a learning bias toward the majority classes.	Semantic Scholar
To cope with the skewed class distribution, many learning methods featuring minority oversampling have been proposed, which are proved to be effective.	Semantic Scholar
To reduce information loss during feature space projection, this study proposes a novel oversampling algorithm, named minority oversampling in kernel adaptive subspaces (MOKAS), which exploits the invariant feature extraction capability of a kernel version of the adaptive subspace self-organizing maps.	Semantic Scholar
The synthetic instances are generated from well-trained subspaces and then their pre-images are reconstructed in the input space.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, these instances characterize nonlinear structures present in the minority class data distribution and help the learning algorithms to counterbalance the skewed class distribution in a desirable manner.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on both real and synthetic data show that the proposed MOKAS is capable of modeling complex data distribution and outperforms a set of state-of-the-art oversampling algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
The problem of deriving lower and upper bounds for the edit distance between undirected, labeled graphs has recently received increasing attention.	Semantic Scholar
However, only one algorithm has been proposed that allegedly computes not only an upper but also a lower bound for non-uniform edit costs and incorporates information about both node and edge labels.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we demonstrate that this algorithm is incorrect.	Semantic Scholar

For example, during walking while reaching towards a goal object results in steps and body postures are adapted to the goal position already multiple steps before the goal contact.	Semantic Scholar
The realization of such highly predictive behaviors for humanoid robots is a challenge because standard approaches, such as optimal control, result in computation times that are prohibitive for the predictive control of complex coordinated full-body movements over multiple steps.	Semantic Scholar
We devised a new architecture that combines the online-planning of complex coordinated full-body movements, based on the flexible combination of learned dynamic movement primitives, with a Walking Pattern Generator (WPG), based on Model Predictive Control (MPC), which generates dynamically feasible locomotion of the humanoid robot HRP-2.

We propose a novel passivity-based stabilization control framework for a certain class of nonholonomic mechanical systems.	Semantic Scholar
First, we derive the notion of passive configuration decomposition, which enables us to configuration-level decompose the system's Lagrange–D’Alembert dynamics into two systems, each evolving on their respective configuration spaces and also individually inheriting Lagrangian structure and passivity from the original dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
We then propose passivity-based time-varying and passivity-based switching control schemes that, by utilizing some control actions defined on each of the configuration spaces of the two systems and also their interplay with the nonholonomic constraint, can achieve stabilization while exploiting the nonlinear dynamics of the decomposed dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
We also provide conditions under which the passive configuration decomposition is possible, establish an equivalence between certain conditions for the proposed controls and kinematic controllability, and elucidate robustness property of the proposed controls based on passivity.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, examples are provided along with their simulation and experimental results to illustrate the theory.	Semantic Scholar
One of the chief obstacles in achieving wider acceptance of robotics is that only experienced roboticists can develop robotics applications.	Semantic Scholar
If we want robots in our homes and offices, we need more tools and platforms that reduce the costs in time and money of prototyping robots.	Semantic Scholar
The open-source paradigm offers a potential solution to these key factors.	Semantic Scholar
However, creating open-source robotics hardware does not mean just making the design files available online.	Semantic Scholar
It is essential to design the hardware in such a way that it can be built and modified by nonexpert users.	Semantic Scholar
We develop a new gradient-based optimization strategy for robotic inspection planning.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm starts from an initial measurement path and evolves this path to decrease path length while maintaining sensor coverage.	Semantic Scholar

The cornerstone of our work is a complete implementation of the simplex method, together with the proof of its correctness and termination.	Semantic Scholar
This allows us to define the basic predicates over polyhedra in an effective way (i.e.	Semantic Scholar

To this end, we make an extensive use of the Boolean reflection methodology.The benefit of this approach is that we can easily derive the proof of several fundamental results on polyhedra, such as Farkas’ Lemma, the duality theorem of linear programming, and Minkowski’s Theorem.	Semantic Scholar
Hybrid VTOL UAVs such as tail-sitters allow several key maneuvers such as vertical takeoff, landing, and hovering while at the same time maintaining superior aerodynamic efficiency at level flight.	Semantic Scholar
However, the large wing area of a tail-sitter at hovering makes it rather sensitive to the cross wind.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a disturbance observer (DOB) based control method to improve its hovering accuracy in presence of external disturbances such as cross wind.	Semantic Scholar
"The presented DOB, operating on top of the aircraft baseline position controller, is designed in frequency domain using <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$H_\infty$</tex-math></inline-formula> synthesis techniques and is guaranteed to stabilize the closed loop system with robustness to model uncertainties."

Comparison study with existing UAV disturbance rejection method is conducted under different wind disturbances.	Semantic Scholar

The trip computers for the two reactor shutdown systems of the Ontario Power Generation (OPG) Darlington Nuclear Power Generating Station are being refurbished due to hardware obsolescence.	Semantic Scholar
For one of the systems, the general purpose computer originally used is being replaced by a programmable logic controller (PLC).	Semantic Scholar
The trip computer application software has been rewritten using function block diagrams (FBDs), a commonly used PLC programming language defined in the IEC 61131-3 standard.	Semantic Scholar
The replacement project’s quality assurance program requires that formal verification be performed to compare the FBDs against a formal software requirements specification written using tabular expressions (TEs).	Semantic Scholar
The PVS theorem proving tool is used in formal verification.	Semantic Scholar
Custom tools developed for OPG are used to translate TEs and FBDs into PVS code.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a method to rigorously translate the graphical FBD language to a mathematical model in PVS using an abstract syntax to represent the FBD constructs.	Semantic Scholar
We use an example from the replacement project to demonstrate the use of the model to translate a FBD module into a PVS specification.	Semantic Scholar
We then extend that example to demonstrate the method’s applicability to a Simulink-based design.	Semantic Scholar
Link prediction is a fundamental problem in social network analysis.	Semantic Scholar
Although the link prediction problem is not new, the challenge of how to exploit various existing network information, such as network structure data and node attribute data, to enable AI-style knowledge inference for large social networks still remains unsolved.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we design and implement a scalable framework that treats link prediction as knowledge reasoning using Markov Logic Networks (MLNs).	Semantic Scholar
Differing from other probabilistic graphical models, MLNs allow undirected relationships with cycles and long-range (non-adjacent) dependency, which are essential and abound in social networks.	Semantic Scholar
In our framework, the prior knowledge is captured as the structure dependency (such as friendship) and the attribute dependency (such as social communities) in terms of inference rules, associated with uncertainty represented as probabilities.	Semantic Scholar
Next, we employ the random walk to discover the inference subgraph, on which probabilistic inference is performed, so that the required computation and storage cost can be significantly reduced without much sacrifice of the inference accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
Our extensive experiments with real-world datasets verify the superiority of our proposed approaches over two baseline methods and show that our approaches are able to provide a tunable tradeoff between inference accuracy and efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
Patients with low back pain are suggested to follow a protective coping strategy.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, rehabilitation of these patients requires estimating their motor control strategies (the control intent).	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present an approach that infers the control intent by solving an inverse Model Predictive Control (iMPC) problem.	Semantic Scholar
The standard Model Predictive Control (MPC) structure includes constraints, therefore, it allows us to model the physiological constraints of motor control.	Semantic Scholar
We devised an iMPC algorithm to solve iMPC problems with experimentally collected output trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
We used experimental data of one healthy subject during a seated balance test that used a physical human–robot interaction.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that the estimated MPC weights reflected the task instructions given to the subject and yielded an acceptable goodness of fit.	Semantic Scholar
The iMPC solution suggests that the subject's control intent was dominated by minimizing the squared sum of a combination of the upper-body and lower-body angles and velocities.	Semantic Scholar
Accurate localization of crop remains highly challenging in unstructured environments, such as farms.	Semantic Scholar
Many developed systems still rely on the use of hand selected features for crop identification and often neglect the estimation of crop quantity and ripeness, which is a key to assigning labor during farming processes.	Semantic Scholar
To alleviate these limitations, we present a robotic vision system that can accurately estimate the quantity and ripeness of sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L), a key horticultural crop.	Semantic Scholar
This system consists of three parts: detection, ripeness estimation, and tracking.	Semantic Scholar
Efficient detection is achieved using the FasterRCNN (FRCNN) framework.	Semantic Scholar
Ripeness is then estimated in the same framework by learning a parallel layer which we experimentally show results in superior performance than treating ripeness as extra classes in the traditional FRCNN framework.	Semantic Scholar
Evaluation of these two techniques outlines the improved performance of the parallel layer, where we achieve an  $F_1$ score of 77.3 for the parallel technique yet only 72.5 for the best scoring (red) of the multiclass implementation.	Semantic Scholar
To track the crop, we present a vision only tracking via detection approach, which uses the FRCNN with parallel layers as input.	Semantic Scholar
Being a vision only solution, this approach is cheap to implement as it only requires a camera and in experiments, using field data, we show that our proposed system can accurately estimate the number of sweet pepper present, to within 4.1% of the visual ground truth.	Semantic Scholar
Recent approaches in robot perception follow the insight that perception is facilitated by interaction with the environment.	Semantic Scholar
These approaches are subsumed under the term Interactive Perception (IP).	Semantic Scholar
This view of perception provides the following benefits.	Semantic Scholar
First, interaction with the environment creates a rich sensory signal that would otherwise not be present.	Semantic Scholar
Second, knowledge of the regularity in the combined space of sensory data and action parameters facilitates the prediction and interpretation of the sensory signal.	Semantic Scholar
In this survey, we postulate this as a principle for robot perception and collect evidence in its support by analyzing and categorizing existing work in this area.	Semantic Scholar
We also provide an overview of the most important applications of IP.	Semantic Scholar
We close this survey by discussing remaining open questions.	Semantic Scholar
With this survey, we hope to help define the field of Interactive Perception and to provide a valuable resource for future research.	Semantic Scholar
For humans, the process of grasping an object relies heavily on rich tactile feedback.	Semantic Scholar
Most recent robotic grasping work, however, has been based only on visual input, and thus cannot easily benefit from feedback after initiating contact.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we investigate how a robot can learn to use tactile information to iteratively and efficiently adjust its grasp.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we propose an end-to-end action-conditional model that learns regrasping policies from raw visuo-tactile data.	Semantic Scholar
This model—a deep, multimodal convolutional network—predicts the outcome of a candidate grasp adjustment, and then executes a grasp by iteratively selecting the most promising actions.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach requires neither calibration of the tactile sensors nor any analytical modeling of contact forces, thus reducing the engineering effort required to obtain efficient grasping policies.	Semantic Scholar
We train our model with data from about 6450 grasping trials on a two-finger gripper equipped with GelSight high-resolution tactile sensors on each finger.	Semantic Scholar
Across extensive experiments, our approach outperforms a variety of baselines at 1) estimating grasp adjustment outcomes, 2) selecting efficient grasp adjustments for quick grasping, and 3) reducing the amount of force applied at the fingers, while maintaining competitive performance.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we study the choices made by our model and show that it has successfully acquired useful and interpretable grasping behaviors.	Semantic Scholar
Although deep neural networks (DNNs) are being a revolutionary power to open up the AI era, the notoriously huge hardware overhead has challenged their applications.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, several binary and ternary networks, in which the costly multiply-accumulate operations can be replaced by accumulations or even binary logic operations, make the on-chip training of DNNs quite promising.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore there is a pressing need to build an architecture that could subsume these networks under a unified framework that achieves both higher performance and less overhead.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, two fundamental issues are yet to be addressed.	Semantic Scholar
The first one is how to implement the back propagation when neuronal activations are discrete.	Semantic Scholar
The second one is how to remove the full-precision hidden weights in the training phase to break the bottlenecks of memory/computation consumption.	Semantic Scholar
To address the first issue, we present a multi-step neuronal activation discretization method and a derivative approximation technique that enable the implementing the back propagation algorithm on discrete DNNs.	Semantic Scholar
While for the second issue, we propose a discrete state transition (DST) methodology to constrain the weights in a discrete space without saving the hidden weights.	Semantic Scholar
Through this way, we build a unified framework that subsumes the binary or ternary networks as its special cases, and under which a heuristic algorithm is provided at the website https://github.com/AcrossV/Gated-XNOR.	Semantic Scholar
More particularly, we find that when both the weights and activations become ternary values, the DNNs can be reduced to sparse binary networks, termed as gated XNOR networks (GXNOR-Nets) since only the event of non-zero weight and non-zero activation enables the control gate to start the XNOR logic operations in the original binary networks.	Semantic Scholar
This promises the event-driven hardware design for efficient mobile intelligence.	Semantic Scholar
We achieve advanced performance compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the computational sparsity and the number of states in the discrete space can be flexibly modified to make it suitable for various hardware platforms.	Semantic Scholar
Nonconvex variants of support vector machines (SVMs) have been developed for various purposes.	Semantic Scholar
For example, robust SVMs attain robustness to outliers by using a nonconvex loss function, while extended -SVM (E-SVM) extends the range of the hyperparameter by introducing a nonconvex constraint.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we consider an extended robust support vector machine (ER-SVM), a robust variant of E-SVM.	Semantic Scholar
ER-SVM combines two types of nonconvexity from robust SVMs and E-SVM.	Semantic Scholar
Because of the two nonconvexities, the existing algorithm we proposed needs to be divided into two parts depending on whether the hyperparameter value is in the extended range or not.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm also heuristically solves the nonconvex problem in the extended range.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a new, efficient algorithm for ER-SVM.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm deals with two types of nonconvexity while never entailing more computations than either E-SVM or robust SVM, and it finds a critical point of ER-SVM.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we show that ER-SVM includes the existing robust SVMs as special cases.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of integrating the two nonconvexities.	Semantic Scholar
In large-scale camera networks, label information for person re-identification is usually not available under a large amount of cameras due to expensive human labor efforts.	Semantic Scholar
Semi-supervised learning could be employed to train a discriminative classifier by using unlabeled data and unmatched image pairs (negatives) generated from non-overlapping camera views, but existing methods suffer from the problem of imbalanced unlabeled data.	Semantic Scholar
In this context, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised region metric learning method to improve person re-identification performance under imbalanced unlabeled data.	Semantic Scholar
Firstly, instead of seeking for matched image pairs (positives) from the unlabeled data, we propose to estimate positive neighbors by label propagation with cross person score distribution alignment.	Semantic Scholar
Secondly, multiple positive regions are generated using sets of positive neighbors to learn a discriminative region-to-point metric.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results demonstrate that the superiority of the proposed method over existing unsupervised, semi-supervised and person re-identification methods.	Semantic Scholar
Real-time simultaneous localization and dense mapping is very helpful for providing virtual reality and augmented reality for surgeons or even surgical robots.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose MIS-SLAM: A complete real-time large-scale dense deformable SLAM system with stereoscope in minimal invasive surgery (MIS) based on heterogeneous computing by making full use of CPU and GPU.	Semantic Scholar
Idled CPU is used to perform ORB-SLAM for providing robust global pose.	Semantic Scholar
Strategies are taken to integrate modules from CPU and GPU.	Semantic Scholar
We solved the key problem raised in the previous work, that is, fast movement of scope and blurry images make the scope tracking fail.	Semantic Scholar
Benefiting from improved localization, MIS-SLAM can achieve large-scale scope localizing and dense mapping in real time.	Semantic Scholar
It transforms and deforms current model and incrementally fuses new observation while keeping vivid texture.	Semantic Scholar
In-vivo experiments conducted on publicly available datasets presented in the form of videos demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of MIS-SLAM for potential clinical purpose.	Semantic Scholar
This paper addresses the problem of robust stability for quaternion-valued neural networks (QVNNs) with leakage delay, discrete delay and parameter uncertainties.	Semantic Scholar
Based on Homeomorphic mapping theorem and Lyapunov theorem, via modulus inequality technique of quaternions, some sufficient conditions on the existence, uniqueness, and global robust stability of the equilibrium point are derived for the delayed QVNNs with parameter uncertainties.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, as direct applications of these results, several sufficient conditions are obtained for checking the global robust stability of QVNNs without leakage delay as well as complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with both leakage and discrete delays.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, two numerical examples are provided to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed results.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a new value function approach for model-free reinforcement learning in Markov decision processes involving high dimensional states that addresses the issues of brittleness and intractable computational complexity, therefore rendering the value function approach based reinforcement learning algorithms applicable to high dimensional systems.	Semantic Scholar
Our new algorithm, Kernel Dynamic Policy Programming (KDPP) smoothly updates the value function in accordance to the Kullback-Leibler divergence between current and updated policies.	Semantic Scholar
Stabilizing the learning in this manner enables the application of the kernel trick to value function approximation, which greatly reduces computational requirements for learning in high dimensional state spaces.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of KDPP against other kernel trick based value function approaches is first investigated in a simulated n DOF manipulator reaching task, where only KDPP efficiently learned a viable policy at n=40.	Semantic Scholar
As an application to a real world high dimensional robot system, KDPP successfully learned the task of unscrewing a bottle cap via a Pneumatic Artificial Muscle (PAM) driven robotic hand with tactile sensors; a system with a state space of 32 dimensions, while given limited samples and with ordinary computing resources.

This letter introduces the “spherepix” data structure for efficient implementation of low-level image processing operations on spherical images.	Semantic Scholar
Efficient implementation of low-level image processing depends heavily on separability of the convolution kernels that form the fundamental building blocks of most algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the curvature of the sphere, it is not possible to place an orthogonal grid pixelation globally on its surface, making direct application of classical separable kernel convolutions impossible.	Semantic Scholar
In the spherepix data structure, we propose an alternative approach consisting of a collection of overlapping (near orthogonal) grid patches covering the sphere's surface.	Semantic Scholar
Close to the boundaries of patches, we introduce data interpolation between patch grids to ensure information flow between grid patches.	Semantic Scholar
After each image processing subroutine, we reconcile data in the overlapping regions to homogenize the global data representation.	Semantic Scholar
We claim that the additional computational cost of data interpolation and data reconciliation is easily compensated by the computational saving and algorithmic simplicity of applying existing image processing subroutines in the grid patches.	Semantic Scholar
The approach is demonstrated by implementing a SIFT feature point algorithm in spherepix coordinates and comparing precision, recall, and computational cost of the proposed approach to documented modifications of the SIFT algorithm specifically developed for implementation on spherical images.

Gesture typing is a stroke-based text input method for mobile devices.	Semantic Scholar
Instead of tapping, the user enters a word by gesturing through all its letters on a virtual keyboard with a single continuous stroke.	Semantic Scholar

Finally, we introduce a framework capable of synthesizing the trajectories of word gestures that share many features with human-generated gestures.	Semantic Scholar
We use these synthetic gestures to automatically evaluate gesture recognition algorithms with thousands of gestures.	Semantic Scholar
Visual lifelogging consists of acquiring images that capture the daily experiences of the user by wearing a camera over a long period of time.	Semantic Scholar
The pictures taken offer considerable potential for knowledge mining concerning how people live their lives; hence, they open up new opportunities for many potential applications in fields including healthcare, security, leisure, and the quantified self.	Semantic Scholar
However, automatically building a story from a huge collection of unstructured egocentric data presents major challenges.	Semantic Scholar
This paper provides a thorough review of advances made so far in egocentric data analysis and, in view of the current state of the art, indicates new lines of research to move us toward storytelling from visual lifelogging.	Semantic Scholar
Robust principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most important dimension-reduction techniques for handling high-dimensional data with outliers.	Semantic Scholar
However, most of the existing robust PCA presupposes that the mean of the data is zero and incorrectly utilizes the average of data as the optimal mean of robust PCA.	Semantic Scholar
In fact, this assumption holds only for the squared -norm-based traditional PCA.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we equivalently reformulate the objective of conventional PCA and learn the optimal projection directions by maximizing the sum of projected difference between each pair of instances based on -norm.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method is robust to outliers and also invariant to rotation.	Semantic Scholar
More important, the reformulated objective not only automatically avoids the calculation of optimal mean and makes the assumption of centered data unnecessary, but also theoretically connects to the minimization of reconstruction error.	Semantic Scholar
To solve the proposed nonsmooth problem, we exploit an efficient optimization algorithm to soften the contributions from outliers by reweighting each data point iteratively.	Semantic Scholar
We theoretically analyze the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experimental results on several benchmark data sets illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
Graphs offer a natural model for the relationships and interactions among entities, such as those occurring among users in social and cooperation networks, and proteins in biological networks.	Semantic Scholar
Since most such networks are dynamic, to capture their evolution over time, we assume a sequence of graph snapshots where each graph snapshot represents the state of the network at a different time instance.	Semantic Scholar
"Given this sequence, we seek to find the top-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""semertzidis-ieq2-2823754.gif""/> </alternatives></inline-formula> <italic>most durable matches</italic> of an input graph pattern query, that is, the matches that exist for the longest period of time."	Semantic Scholar
The straightforward way to address this problem is to apply a state-of-the-art graph pattern matching algorithm at each snapshot and then aggregate the results.	Semantic Scholar
However, for large networks and long sequences, this approach is computationally expensive, since all matches have to be generated at each snapshot, including those appearing only once.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a new approach that uses a compact representation of the sequence of graph snapshots, appropriate time indexes to prune the search space, and strategies to determine the duration of the seeking matches.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we present experiments with real datasets that illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.	Semantic Scholar
Large-scale graph and machine learning analytics widely employ distributed iterative processing.	Semantic Scholar
Typically, these analytics are a part of a comprehensive workflow, which includes data preparation, model building, and model evaluation.	Semantic Scholar
General-purpose distributed dataflow frameworks execute all steps of such workflows holistically.	Semantic Scholar
This holistic view enables these systems to reason about and automatically optimize the entire pipeline.	Semantic Scholar
Here, graph and machine learning analytics are known to incur a long runtime since they require multiple passes over the data until convergence is reached.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, fault tolerance and a fast-recovery from any intermittent failure is critical for efficient analysis.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose novel fault-tolerant mechanisms for graph and machine learning analytics that run on distributed dataflow systems.	Semantic Scholar
We seek to reduce checkpointing costs and shorten failure recovery times.	Semantic Scholar
For graph processing, rather than writing checkpoints that block downstream operators, our mechanism writes checkpoints in an unblocking manner that does not break pipelined tasks.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to the conventional approach for unblocking checkpointing (e.g., that manage checkpoints independently for immutable datasets), we inject the checkpoints of mutable datasets into the iterative dataflow itself.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, our mechanism is iteration-aware by design.	Semantic Scholar
This simplifies the system architecture and facilitates coordinating checkpoint creation during iterative graph processing.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we are able to rapidly rebound, via confined recovery, by exploiting the fact that log files exist locally on healthy nodes and managing to avoid a complete recomputation from scratch.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we propose replica recovery for machine learning algorithms, whereby we employ a broadcast variable that enables us to quickly recover without having to introduce any checkpoints.	Semantic Scholar
In order to evaluate our fault tolerance strategies, we conduct both a theoretical study and experimental analyses using Apache Flink and discover that they outperform blocking checkpointing and complete recovery.	Semantic Scholar

This paper proposes a modeling method for generic compliant robotic manipulators.	Semantic Scholar
It is based on graph theory and the port-Hamiltonian formalism, which allows a modular approach to the interconnection of rigid bodies with compliant actuators by means of kinematic pairs.	Semantic Scholar
This modularity enables a simple and straight-forward adaption the model when a manipulator's actuator morphology is changed.	Semantic Scholar
An example of a spatial three degree-of-freedom manipulator shows that this modeling method is more suitable for modeling changes in actuator placement than the traditional Euler–Lagrange method.	Semantic Scholar
Display clutter can cause breakdowns in visual search performance, which can compromise system safety and efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
The differential contributions of the two main aspects of clutter—data density and display organization—to these breakdowns are not well understood.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, it is not clear how these factors interact with stress, another factor that can degrade performance in data-rich domains.	Semantic Scholar
The aim of this study was to ascertain the effects of data density, display organization, and stress on visual search performance and associated eye movements (obtained via eye tracking).	Semantic Scholar
To this end, participants performed visual search tasks in a simulated graphics program.	Semantic Scholar
Data density (number of icons), organization (grouping of icons), and stress (presence of a time limit) were manipulated.	Semantic Scholar
Response time (RT), error rate, eye tracking data, and subjective ratings of clutter and stress were collected.	Semantic Scholar
Results confirmed that high data density and poor organization increase RT and error rate.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, poor organization worsened the effects of high data density on RT.	Semantic Scholar
Stress did not negatively affect performance but significantly decreased RT.	Semantic Scholar
Eye tracking metrics provided insight into the effects of the two clutter aspects and stress.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, these metrics helped explain how changes in attention allocation resulted in the observed performance effects of long RT and high error rate.	Semantic Scholar
The results of this research can be used to inform the design of data-rich displays and trigger display adaptations in real time.	Semantic Scholar
Learning the global hand orientation from 2D monocular images is a challenging task, as the projected hand shape is affected by a number of variations.	Semantic Scholar
These include inter-person hand shape and size variations, intra-person pose and style variations and self-occlusion due to varying hand orientation.	Semantic Scholar
Given a hand orientation dataset containing these variations, a single regressor proves to be limited for learning the mapping of hand silhouette images onto the orientation angles.	Semantic Scholar
We address this by proposing a staged probabilistic regressor (SPORE) which consists of multiple expert regressors, each one learning a subset of variations from the dataset.	Semantic Scholar
Inspired by Boosting, the novelty of our method comes from the staged probabilistic learning, where each stage consists of training and adding an expert regressor to the intermediate ensemble of expert regressors.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike Boosting, we marginalize the posterior prediction probabilities from each expert regressor by learning a marginalization weights regressor, where the weights are extracted during training using a Kullback–Leibler divergence-based optimization.	Semantic Scholar
We extend and evaluate our proposed framework for inferring hand orientation and pose simultaneously.	Semantic Scholar
In comparison to the state-of-the-art of hand orientation inference, multi-layered Random Forest marginalization and Boosting, our proposed method proves to be more accurate.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, experimental results reveal that simultaneously learning hand orientation and pose from 2D monocular images significantly improves the pose classification performance.	Semantic Scholar

Event discovery aims to discover a temporal segment of interest, such as human behavior, actions or activities.	Semantic Scholar
Most approaches to event discovery within or between time series use supervised learning.	Semantic Scholar
This becomes problematic when relevant event labels are unknown, are difficult to detect, or not all possible combinations of events have been anticipated.	Semantic Scholar
To overcome these problems, this paper explores Common Event Discovery (CED), a new problem that aims to discover common events of variable-length segments in an unsupervised manner.	Semantic Scholar
A potential solution to CED is searching over all possible pairs of segments, which would incur a prohibitive quartic cost.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose an efficient branch-and-bound (B&B) framework that avoids exhaustive search while guaranteeing a globally optimal solution.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we derive novel bounding functions for various commonality measures and provide extensions to multiple commonality discovery and accelerated search.	Semantic Scholar
The B&B framework takes as input any multidimensional signal that can be quantified into histograms.	Semantic Scholar
A generalization of the framework can be readily applied to discover events at the same or different times (synchrony and event commonality, respectively).	Semantic Scholar
We consider extensions to video search and supervised event detection.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness of the B&B framework is evaluated in motion capture of deliberate behavior and in video of spontaneous facial behavior in diverse interpersonal contexts: interviews, small groups of young adults, and parent-infant face-to-face interaction.	Semantic Scholar
Hammers provide most powerful general purpose automation for proof assistants based on HOL and set theory today.	Semantic Scholar
Despite the gaining popularity of the more advanced versions of type theory, such as those based on the Calculus of Inductive Constructions, the construction of hammers for such foundations has been hindered so far by the lack of translation and reconstruction components.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present an architecture of a full hammer for dependent type theory together with its implementation for the Coq proof assistant.	Semantic Scholar
A key component of the hammer is a proposed translation from the Calculus of Inductive Constructions, with certain extensions introduced by Coq, to untyped first-order logic.	Semantic Scholar
The translation is “sufficiently” sound and complete to be of practical use for automated theorem provers.	Semantic Scholar
We also introduce a proof reconstruction mechanism based on an eauto-type algorithm combined with limited rewriting, congruence closure and some forward reasoning.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm is able to re-prove in the Coq logic most of the theorems established by the ATPs.	Semantic Scholar
Together with machine-learning based selection of relevant premises this constitutes a full hammer system.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of the whole procedure is evaluated in a bootstrapping scenario emulating the development of the Coq standard library.	Semantic Scholar
For each theorem in the library only the previous theorems and proofs can be used.	Semantic Scholar
We show that 40.8% of the theorems can be proved in a push-button mode in about 40 s of real time on a 8-CPU system.	Semantic Scholar
As suggested by Palop and Mucke (2010) pathologically elevated β-amyloid (Aβ) impairs long term potentiation (LTP) and enhances long term depression (LTD) possible underlying mechanisms in Alzheimer's Disease (AD).	Semantic Scholar
In the present paper we adopt and further elaborate a phenomenological computational model of bidirectional plasticity based on the calcium control hypothesis of Shouval et al.	Semantic Scholar
(2002).	Semantic Scholar
First, to account for Aβ effects the activation function Ω was modified assuming competition between LTP and LTD, and parameter sets were identified that well describe both normal and pathological synaptic plasticity processes.	Semantic Scholar
Second, a biophysically plausible kinetic model of bidirectional synaptic plasticity by D'Alcantara et al.	Semantic Scholar
(2003) was used to support findings of the phenomenological model and to further explain underlying kinetic processes.	Semantic Scholar
Model fitting pointed out molecular contributors, particularly calcineurin and type 1 protein phosphatase that might contribute to observed physiological disturbances in AD.	Semantic Scholar
During open surgeries, surgeons use tactile palpation to form an understanding of the anatomy, including any underlying anatomical structures such as arteries or tumors.	Semantic Scholar
This letter explores methods for restoring this capability in the context of minimally invasive robot-assisted surgery.	Semantic Scholar
Previous works have demonstrated the ability of robots to use discrete palpation to characterize organ shape and, when followed with offline data processing, to produce a stiffness map of the organ.	Semantic Scholar
In our earlier work, we presented an offline estimation technique, independent of palpation strategy, to estimate organ shape and stiffness using Gaussian processes.	Semantic Scholar
This study extends our prior work by demonstrating a fast online technique for estimation of organ shape and stiffness.	Semantic Scholar
Our goal is to provide near video-frame-rate updates of the organ geometry and tissue stiffness during force controlled exploration.	Semantic Scholar
Two different palpation modes are experimentally explored: autonomous palpation and constrained semiautonomous teleoperation.	Semantic Scholar
We report the experimental evaluation of our approach for stiffness estimation using autonomous palpation.	Semantic Scholar
And we demonstrate the feasibility of using our method during interactive teleoperation in a simulated surgical scenario.	Semantic Scholar
We believe that future use of the online stiffness and geometry information based on our proposed method can help surgeons in improving their understanding of the surgical scene and its correlation to preoperative imaging, thereby increasing safety and improving surgical outcomes.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system which integrates measurements from multiple cameras to achieve robust pose tracking for autonomous navigation of micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) in unknown complex environments.	Semantic Scholar
We analyze the iterative optimizations for pose tracking and map refinement of visual SLAM in multi-camera cases.	Semantic Scholar
The analysis ensures the soundness and accuracy of each optimization update.	Semantic Scholar
A well-known monocular visual SLAM system is extended to utilize two cameras with non-overlapping fields of view (FOVs) in the final implementation.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting visual SLAM system enables autonomous navigation of an MAV in complex scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
The theory behind this system can easily be extended to multicamera configurations, when the onboard computational capability allows this.	Semantic Scholar
For operations in large-scale environments, we modify the resulting visual SLAM system to be a constant-time robust visual odometry.	Semantic Scholar
To form a full visual SLAM system, we further implement an efficient back-end for loop closing.	Semantic Scholar
The back-end maintains a keyframe-based global map, which is also used for loop-closure detection.	Semantic Scholar
An adaptive-window pose-graph optimization method is proposed to refine keyframe poses of the global map and thus correct pose drift that is inherent in the visual odometry.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed visual SLAM algorithm for applications onboard of MAVs in experiments with both autonomous and manual flights.	Semantic Scholar
The pose tracking results are compared with ground truth data provided by an external tracking system.	Semantic Scholar
By extracting image luminance channel and separating it into a base layer and a detail layer, the Retinex theory has been widely adopted for tone mapping to visualize high dynamic range (HDR) images on low dynamic range display devices.	Semantic Scholar
Many edge-preservation filtering techniques have been proposed to approximate the base layer for Retinex image decomposition; however, the associated tone mapping methods are prone to halo artifacts and false colors because filtering methods are limited in adapting the complex image local structures.	Semantic Scholar
We present a statistical clustering based tone mapping method which can more faithfully adapt image local content and colors.	Semantic Scholar
We decompose each color patch of the HDR image into three components, patch mean, color variation and color structure, and cluster the patches into a number of clusters.	Semantic Scholar
For each cluster, an adaptive subspace can be easily learned by principal component analysis, via which the patches are transformed into a more compact domain for effective tone mapping.	Semantic Scholar
Comparing with the popular edge-preservation filtering methods, the proposed clustering based method can better adapt to image local structures and colors by exploiting the image global redundancy.	Semantic Scholar
Our experimental results demonstrate that it can produce high-quality image with wellpreserved local contrast and vivid color appearance.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the proposed method can be extended to multi-scale for more faithful texture preservation, and off-line subspace learning for efficient implementation.	Semantic Scholar

Knowledge of synaptic input is crucial for understanding synaptic integration and ultimately neural function.	Semantic Scholar
However, in vivo, the rates at which synaptic inputs arrive are high, so that it is typically impossible to detect single events.	Semantic Scholar
We show here that it is nevertheless possible to extract the properties of the events and, in particular, to extract the event rate, the synaptic time constants, and the properties of the event size distribution from in vivo voltage-clamp recordings.	Semantic Scholar
Applied to cerebellar interneurons, our method reveals that the synaptic input rate increases from 600 Hz during rest to 1000 Hz during locomotion, while the amplitude and shape of the synaptic events are unaffected by this state change.	Semantic Scholar
This method thus complements existing methods to measure neural function in vivo.	Semantic Scholar
The hypothesis that the phasic dopamine response reports a reward prediction error has become deeply entrenched.	Semantic Scholar
However, dopamine neurons exhibit several notable deviations from this hypothesis.	Semantic Scholar
A coherent explanation for these deviations can be obtained by analyzing the dopamine response in terms of Bayesian reinforcement learning.	Semantic Scholar
The key idea is that prediction errors are modulated by probabilistic beliefs about the relationship between cues and outcomes, updated through Bayesian inference.	Semantic Scholar
This account can explain dopamine responses to inferred value in sensory preconditioning, the effects of cue preexposure (latent inhibition), and adaptive coding of prediction errors when rewards vary across orders of magnitude.	Semantic Scholar
We further postulate that orbitofrontal cortex transforms the stimulus representation through recurrent dynamics, such that a simple error-driven learning rule operating on the transformed representation can implement the Bayesian reinforcement learning update.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we consider the problem of controlling an aerial robot connected to the ground by a passive cable or a passive rigid link.	Semantic Scholar
We provide a thorough characterization of this nonlinear dynamical robotic system in terms of fundamental properties such as differential flatness, controllability, and observability.	Semantic Scholar
We prove that the robotic system is differentially flat with respect to two output pairs: elevation of the link and attitude of the vehicle; elevation of the link and longitudinal link force (e.g., cable tension, or bar compression).	Semantic Scholar
We show the design of an almost globally convergent nonlinear observer of the full state that resorts only to an onboard accelerometer and a gyroscope.	Semantic Scholar
We also design two almost globally convergent nonlinear controllers to track any sufficiently smooth time-varying trajectory of the two output pairs.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we numerically test the robustness of the proposed method in several far-from-nominal conditions: nonlinear cross-coupling effects, parameter deviations, measurements noise, and nonideal actuators.	Semantic Scholar
As humans we possess an intuitive ability for navigation which we master through years of practice; however existing approaches to model this trait for diverse tasks including monitoring pedestrian flow and detecting abnormal events have been limited by using a variety of hand-crafted features.	Semantic Scholar
Recent research in the area of deep-learning has demonstrated the power of learning features directly from the data; and related research in recurrent neural networks has shown exemplary results in sequence-to-sequence problems such as neural machine translation and neural image caption generation.	Semantic Scholar
Motivated by these approaches, we propose a novel method to predict the future motion of a pedestrian given a short history of their, and their neighbours, past behaviour.	Semantic Scholar
"The novelty of the proposed method is the combined attention model which utilises both ""soft attention"" as well as ""hard-wired"" attention in order to map the trajectory information from the local neighbourhood to the future positions of the pedestrian of interest."	Semantic Scholar
We illustrate how a simple approximation of attention weights (i.e.	Semantic Scholar
hard-wired) can be merged together with soft attention weights in order to make our model applicable for challenging real world scenarios with hundreds of neighbours.	Semantic Scholar
The navigational capability of the proposed method is tested on two challenging publicly available surveillance databases where our model outperforms the current-state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, we illustrate how the proposed architecture can be directly applied for the task of abnormal event detection without handcrafting the features.	Semantic Scholar

A fundamental aspect of biological intelligence, from microbes to megafauna, is the ability to forage for the provisions required to sustain life.	Semantic Scholar
This sometimes underrated ability to seek out, identify, and use objects of interest in an environment with limited prior knowledge is an important capability that is also needed by robots.	Semantic Scholar
Many robotics applications can be modeled as foraging problems, such as search and rescue, wildlife tracking, crop pollination and harvesting, mining and in-situ-resource utilization, and scientific data/sample collection.	Semantic Scholar
Designing robotic systems capable of low-power operation, inherent to their compliant actuation, has been elusive in practical application.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a physical measure to mathematically define mechanical designs that are suitable to realize stiffness modulation with low power cost.	Semantic Scholar
Using this measure, we present a mathematical formulation of an ideal variable stiffness mechanism unaffected by the external load during its operation.	Semantic Scholar
We then analyze several existing mechanisms from the literature to relate design features with analytical conditions inherent to low power stiffness modulation in practical designs.	Semantic Scholar
Through this analysis, we identify an approximate practical realization of an ideal actuator capable of stiffness modulation with inherently low power cost.	Semantic Scholar
Similar to a number of existing efficient variable stiffness mechanisms, this mechanism is able to hold a given stiffness setting with zero input force under no external load.	Semantic Scholar
However, unlike many other previously designed mechanisms, it enables infinite range stiffness modulation using finite control forces.	Semantic Scholar
A practical variable stiffness mechanism that is capable of infinite range stiffness modulation using finite control forces leads to lower power cost and reduced energy consumption.	Semantic Scholar
Given a high-order large-scale tensor, how can we decompose it into latent factors?	Semantic Scholar
Can we process it on commodity computers with limited memory?	Semantic Scholar
These questions are closely related to recommender systems, which have modeled rating data not as a matrix but as a tensor to utilize contextual information such as time and location.	Semantic Scholar
This increase in the order requires tensor-factorization methods scalable with both the order and size of a tensor.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose two distributed tensor factorization methods, CDTF and SALS.	Semantic Scholar
Both methods are scalable with all aspects of data and show a trade-off between convergence speed and memory requirements.	Semantic Scholar
CDTF, based on coordinate descent, updates one parameter at a time, while SALS generalizes on the number of parameters updated at a time.	Semantic Scholar
In our experiments, only our methods factorized a five-order tensor with 1 billion observable entries, 10 M mode length, and 1 K rank, while all other state-of-the-art methods failed.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, our methods required several orders of magnitude less memory than their competitors.	Semantic Scholar
We implemented our methods on MAPREDUCE with two widely-applicable optimization techniques: local disk caching and greedy row assignment.	Semantic Scholar
They speeded up our methods up to 98.2× and also the competitors up to 5.9×.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose SUbsequence Matching framework with cell MERgence (SUMMER) for online subsequence matching between histogram-based stream synopsis structures under the dynamic time warping distance.	Semantic Scholar
Given a query synopsis pattern, SUMMER continuously identifies all the matching subsequences for a stream as the bins are generated.	Semantic Scholar
To effectively reduce the computation time, we design a Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (WDTW) algorithm, which computes the warping distance directly between two histogram-based synopses.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, a Stack-based Overlapping Filter Algorithm (SOFA) is provided to remove the overlapping subsequences to avoid the redundant information.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we design an optional refinement module to relax the subsequence range limit and improve the matching accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
Our experiments on real datasets show that the proposed method significantly speeds up the pattern matching without compromising the accuracy required when compared with other approaches.	Semantic Scholar
As robots enter human environments, they will be expected to collaborate and coordinate their actions with people.	Semantic Scholar
In order for robots to become more fluent at this, particularly in groups, robots must be able to recognize, understand, and anticipate coordinated human activities.	Semantic Scholar
However, how robots engage in this process can influence the dynamics of the team, particularly in multihuman, multirobot situations.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we investigate how the presence of robots affects group coordination when both the anticipation algorithms they employ and their number (single robot or multirobot) vary.	Semantic Scholar
Our results suggest that group coordination is significantly affected when a robot joins a human-only group, and is further affected when a second robot joins the group and employs a different anticipation algorithm from the other robot.	Semantic Scholar
These findings suggest that heterogeneous behavior of robots in a multihuman group can play a major role in how group coordination dynamics stabilize (or fail), and may have implications for how we design future human–robot teams.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes new techniques for data representation in the context of deep learning using agglomerative clustering.	Semantic Scholar
Existing autoencoder-based data representation techniques tend to produce a number of encoding and decoding receptive fields of layered autoencoders that are duplicative, thereby leading to extraction of similar features, thus resulting in filtering redundancy.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a way to address this problem and show that such redundancy can be eliminated.	Semantic Scholar
This yields smaller networks and produces unique receptive fields that extract distinct features.	Semantic Scholar
It is also shown that autoencoders with nonnegativity constraints on weights are capable of extracting fewer redundant features than conventional sparse autoencoders.	Semantic Scholar
The concept is illustrated using conventional sparse autoencoder and nonnegativity-constrained autoencoders with MNIST digits recognition, NORB normalized-uniform object data and Yale face dataset.	Semantic Scholar
Effective diagnosis performance is necessary for the operation of safety-critical industrial systems.	Semantic Scholar
Diagnosis depends on the information provided, perceived, interpreted, and integrated by operators.	Semantic Scholar
This paper examines the influence of information layout on diagnosis performance.	Semantic Scholar
Three layouts were designed to meet the information requirements identified through a work domain analysis and task analysis.	Semantic Scholar
One interface depicted the vertical means-end relations in the abstraction hierarchy, a second depicted the horizontal relations between nodes, and a third followed a conventional mimic layout.	Semantic Scholar
Because vertical means-end relations present a clear mapping between functional and physical information, it was hypothesized that the vertical interface would facilitate more effective use of functional information and thereby better support diagnosis performance compared with the horizontal and mimic interfaces.	Semantic Scholar
No significant influence of information layout on diagnosis accuracy or completion time was found.	Semantic Scholar
However, the participants who used the vertical and horizontal interfaces were more confident with their diagnosis conclusions than those using the mimic interface.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the participants using the vertically integrated interface spent significantly less time generating correct hypotheses than the participants using either the horizontal or mimic interfaces.	Semantic Scholar
These findings stress the importance of information layout for interfaces of safety-critical systems.	Semantic Scholar
Determining optimal activation function in artificial neural networks is an important issue because it is directly linked with obtained success rates.	Semantic Scholar
But, unfortunately, there is not any way to determine them analytically, optimal activation function is generally determined by trials or tuning.	Semantic Scholar
This paper addresses, a simpler and a more effective approach to determine optimal activation function.	Semantic Scholar
In this approach, which can be called as trained activation function, an activation function was trained for each particular neuron by linear regression.	Semantic Scholar
This training process was done based on the training dataset, which consists the sums of inputs of each neuron in the hidden layer and desired outputs.	Semantic Scholar
By this way, a different activation function was generated for each neuron in the hidden layer.	Semantic Scholar
This approach was employed in random weight artificial neural network (RWN) and validated by 50 benchmark datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Achieved success rates by RWN that used trained activation functions were higher than obtained success rates by RWN that used traditional activation functions.	Semantic Scholar
Obtained results showed that proposed approach is a successful, simple and an effective way to determine optimal activation function instead of trials or tuning in both randomized single and multilayer ANNs.	Semantic Scholar
We present a novel approach to segment coronary cross-sectional images acquired using catheterization imaging techniques, i.e.	Semantic Scholar
intra-vascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT).	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach combines cross-sectional segmentation with longitudinal tracking in order to tackle various forms of imaging artifacts and to achieve consistent segmentation.	Semantic Scholar
A node-weighted directed graph is constructed on two consecutive cross-sectional frames with embedded shape constraints within individual cross-sections or frames and between consecutive frames.	Semantic Scholar
The intra-frame constraints are derived from a set of training samples and are embedded in both graph construction and its cost function.	Semantic Scholar
The inter-frame constraints are imposed by tracking the borders of interest across multiple frames.	Semantic Scholar
The coronary images are transformed from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates.	Semantic Scholar
Graph partition can then be formulated as searching an optimal interface in the node-weighted directed graph without user initialization.	Semantic Scholar
It also allows efficient parametrization of the border using radial basis function (RBF) and thus reduces the tracking of a large number of border points to a very few RBF centers.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we carry out supervised column-wise tissue classification in order to automatically optimize the feature selection.	Semantic Scholar
Instead of empirically assigning weights to different feature detectors, we dynamically and automatically adapt those weighting depending on the tissue compositions in each individual column of pixels.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach is applied to IVUS and OCT images.	Semantic Scholar
Both qualitative and quantitative results show superior performance of the proposed method compared to a number of alternative segmentation techniques.	Semantic Scholar
Geometric dynamic configurations of body joints play an essential role in distinguishing different human activities.	Semantic Scholar
However, many existing human activity recognition approaches lack the capability of automatically learning these configurations from sequences of joints in four-dimensional space (spatio and temporal).	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, the authors propose an automatic joint configuration learning method, based on dictionary learning and sparse representation.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method achieves the following features: 1) it automatically learns dynamic spatio-temporal geometric configurations of body joints, involved in activities, in a simple way; 2) it dispenses with the hand crafted feature designing process and provides a new method to organize joint coordinate data as fixed length column vectors, which are suitable for dictionary learning; 3) it replaces the conventional bag of words model with sparse coding method; words in learned dictionary capture subactivity features, and the frequencies of different words appearing in different activities characterize the categories of global activity; 4) it is robust to time misalignment and can classify any length of video sequence (online classification) in real time; 5) it is easy to combine this method with other forms of data for better performance, because of its data driven nature and flexible framework.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method is tested with three state-of-the-art public human activity recognition datasets and the results are found to be better than those of CAD-60 dataset, and comparable to those of both MSR Action 3D and MSR Daily Activity datasets (source codes are publicly available at  https://github.com/jinqijinqi/SparseCodingDictionaryLearningHumanActivityRecognition).

One of the core values of Industry 4.0 targets to integrate people's demand into manufacturing for enhanced products, systems, and services for a wider variety of increasingly personalized customization of products.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, Industry 4.0 advances the traditional manufacturing techniques from mass production toward mass customization (MC).	Semantic Scholar
Take wheel machining automation (WMA) as an example.	Semantic Scholar
To meet MC expectations, manufacturers should offer customized wheels at a large scale with low cost, short lead-time, and high quality.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, WMA cells with MC capability are requested to be designed to have a high degree of quick responsiveness to accurately react on machining-condition changes for manufacturing different wheel types.	Semantic Scholar
To meet the requirements of MC production, this work proposes to apply the automatic virtual metrology (AVM) system together with the so-called target-value-adjustment (TVA) scheme.	Semantic Scholar
The AVM system was developed by the authors to convert sampling inspections with metrology delay into real-time and on-line total inspection, while the TVA scheme is designed to enhance AVM's adaptive customization capability for automatically and rapidly accomplishing the goals of MC production.	Semantic Scholar
To demonstrate the versatility of the AVM-plus-TVA approach, the other example in semiconductor etching process is also illustrated.	Semantic Scholar
The semantic web has enabled the creation of a growing number of knowledge bases (KBs), which are designed independently using different techniques.	Semantic Scholar
Integration of KBs has attracted much attention as different KBs usually contain overlapping and complementary information.	Semantic Scholar
Automatic techniques for KB integration have been improved but far from perfect.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of knowledge base semantic integration using crowd intelligence.	Semantic Scholar
There are both classes and instances in a KB, in our work, we propose a novel hybrid framework for KB semantic integration considering the semantic heterogeneity of KB class structures.	Semantic Scholar
We first perform semantic integration of the class structures via crowdsourcing, then apply the blocking-based instance matching approach according to the integrated class structure.	Semantic Scholar
For class structure (taxonomy) semantic integration, the crowd is leveraged to help identifying the semantic relationships between classes to handle the semantic heterogeneity problem.	Semantic Scholar
Under the conditions of both large scale KBs and limited monetary budget for crowdsourcing, we formalize the class structure (taxonomy) semantic integration problem as a Local Tree Based Query Selection  (LTQS) problem.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the LTQS problem is NP-hard and propose two greedy-based algorithms, i.e., static query selection and adaptive query selection.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the KBs are usually of large scales and have millions of instances, direct pairwise-based instance matching is inefficient.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we adopt the blocking-based strategy for instance matching, taking advantage of the class structure (taxonomy) integration result.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments on real large scale KBs verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches.	Semantic Scholar
The high computational cost (CC) of neuromusculoskeletal modeling is usually considered a serious barrier in clinical applications.	Semantic Scholar

This study is aimed at proposing two novel approaches, inverse muscular dynamics with inequality constraints (IMDIC) and inverse-forward muscular dynamics with inequality constraints (IFMDIC), not only to reduce CC but also to amend the computational errors compared to the well-known approach of extended inverse dynamics (EID).	Semantic Scholar
To do that, the equality constraints of optimization problem, which are computationally tough to satisfy, are replaced by inequality constraints, which are easier to satisfy.	Semantic Scholar
To verify the practical application of the proposed approaches, the muscle activations of the lower limbs during the half of a gait cycle are quantified.	Semantic Scholar
The simulation results of the optimal muscle activations are then compared to the experimental ones.	Semantic Scholar
The results reveal that IMDIC requires less CC (87.5%) compared to EID.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, CC of IMDIC was about 33.3% improved by the application of IFMDIC.	Semantic Scholar
The findings of this study suggest that although the novel approach of IFMDIC decreases CC compared to IMDIC, the convergence of its results is very sensitive to the primary guess of the optimization variables.	Semantic Scholar
In various industries, there is a need for low-cost, flexible robotic grasping systems that handle and classify different items, which usually involve low-cost grippers and reliable manipulations.	Semantic Scholar
One-degree-offreedom (1-DoF) two-pin or three-pin grippers are widely used in the automation of manufacturing processes because of their low cost and high reliability.	Semantic Scholar
However, some uncertainties introduced by the object and the gripper may affect the robustness of the grasp.	Semantic Scholar
The principle of caging enables us to deal with these uncertainties, and it is therefore important to study caging as a practical solution to improve the grasps of 1-DoF industrial grippers.	Semantic Scholar
Compliant elements in robotic systems can strongly increase the energy efficiency of highly dynamic periodic motions with large energy consumption such as jumping.	Semantic Scholar
Their control is a challenging task for multijoint systems.	Semantic Scholar
Typical control algorithms are model-based and thus fail to adjust to unexpected mechanical environments or make limited use of mechanical resonance properties.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we apply numerical optimal control theory to demonstrate that close-to-optimal energy-efficient movements can be induced from a one-dimensional (1-D) submanifold in jumping systems that show nonlinear hybrid dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
Linear weights transform sensory information into this 1-D controller space and reverse transform 1-D motor signals back into the multidimensional joint space.	Semantic Scholar
In Monte-Carlo-based simulations and experiments, we show that an algorithm that we derived previously can extract these weights online from sensory information about joint positions of a moving system.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm is computationally cheap, modular, and adjusts to varying mechanical conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Our results demonstrate that it reduces the problem of energy-efficient control of multiple compliant joints that move with high synchronicity to a low-dimensional task.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce the DROW detector, a deep learning-based object detector operating on 2-dimensional (2-D) range data.	Semantic Scholar
Laser scanners are lighting invariant, provide accurate 2-D range data, and typically cover a large field of view, making them interesting sensors for robotics applications.	Semantic Scholar
So far, research on detection in laser 2-D range data has been dominated by hand-crafted features and boosted classifiers, potentially losing performance due to suboptimal design choices.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) based detector for this task.	Semantic Scholar
We show how to effectively apply CNNs for detection in 2-D range data, and propose a depth preprocessing step and a voting scheme that significantly improve CNN performance.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate our approach on wheelchairs and walkers, obtaining state of the art detection results.	Semantic Scholar
Apart from the training data, none of our design choices limits the detector to these two classes, though.	Semantic Scholar
We provide a ROS node for our detector and release our dataset containing 464 k laser scans, out of which 24 k were annotated.	Semantic Scholar
To harness the rich amount of information available on the web today, many organizations aggregate public (and private) data to derive knowledge repositories for real-world entities.	Semantic Scholar
This paper aims to build historical  profiles of real-world entities by integrating temporal records collected from different sources.	Semantic Scholar
This problem is challenging not only because entities may change their attribute values over time, but also because information provided by the sources could be unreliable.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a new solution for profiling entities over time.	Semantic Scholar
To understand the evolution of entities, we describe a novel transition model which gives the probability that an entity will change to a particular attribute value after some time period.	Semantic Scholar
Next, a set of quality metrics are defined for the data sources to capture the exactness and timeliness of their provided values.	Semantic Scholar
The transition model and the quality metrics are then built into a source-aware temporal matching algorithm that can link temporal records to entities at the right time and augment entity profiles with correct values.	Semantic Scholar
Our suite of experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to outperform the state-of-the-art techniques by constructing more complete and accurate profiles for entities.	Semantic Scholar
Chance constraints are a major modeling tool for problems under uncertainty.	Semantic Scholar
We summarize the basic modeling ingredients of uncertain combinatorial problems and show how the Stochastic Constraint Satisfaction Problems formalism is able to support high-level declarative constructs that allow for ease of modeling of such problems in general.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we outline the different propagation methods for chance constraints.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we identify some modeling subtleties that might arise when modeling with chance constraints.	Semantic Scholar
Quadrotors with large thrust-to-weight ratios are able to track aggressive trajectories with sharp turns and high accelerations.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we develop a search-based trajectory planning algorithm that exploits the quadrotor maneuverability to generate sequences of motion primitives in cluttered environments.	Semantic Scholar
We model the quadrotor body as an ellipsoid and compute its flight attitude along trajectories in order to check for collisions against obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
The ellipsoid model allows the quadrotor to pass through gaps that are smaller than its diameter with nonzero pitch or roll angles.	Semantic Scholar
Without any prior information about the location of gaps and associated attitude constraints, our algorithm is able to find a safe and optimal trajectory that guides the robot to its goal as fast as possible.	Semantic Scholar
To accelerate planning, we first perform a lower dimensional search and use it as a heuristic to guide the generation of a final dynamically feasible trajectory.	Semantic Scholar
We analyze critical discretization parameters of motion primitive planning and demonstrate the feasibility of the generated trajectories in various simulations and real-world experiments.	Semantic Scholar
I present a formalization in Isabelle/HOL of the resolution calculus for first-order logic with formal soundness and completeness proofs.	Semantic Scholar
To prove the calculus sound, I use the substitution lemma, and to prove it complete, I use Herbrand interpretations and semantic trees.	Semantic Scholar
The correspondence between unsatisfiable sets of clauses and finite semantic trees is formalized in Herbrand’s theorem.	Semantic Scholar
I discuss the difficulties that I had formalizing proofs of the lifting lemma found in the literature, and I formalize a correct proof.	Semantic Scholar
The completeness proof is by induction on the size of a finite semantic tree.	Semantic Scholar
Throughout the paper I emphasize details that are often glossed over in paper proofs.	Semantic Scholar
I give a thorough overview of formalizations of first-order logic found in the literature.	Semantic Scholar
The formalization of resolution is part of the IsaFoL project, which is an effort to formalize logics in Isabelle/HOL.	Semantic Scholar
The future of human space exploration will involve extra-vehicular activities (EVAs) on foreign planetary surfaces (i.e., Mars), an activity that will have significantly different characteristics than exploration scenarios on Earth.	Semantic Scholar
These activities become challenging due to restricted vision and limitations placed on sensory feedback from altered gravity and the space suit.	Semantic Scholar
The use of a bulky, pressurized EVA suit perceptually disconnects human explorers from the hostile environment, increasing navigation workload and the risk of collision associated with traversing through unfamiliar terrain.	Semantic Scholar
Multimodal displays are considered as a means to provide information to the astronaut as cues to multiple sensory modalities enhance cognitive processing through taking advantage of multiple sensory resources, and are believed to communicate the risk more efficiently than unimodal cues.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a wearable multimodal interface system to examine human performance when visual, vibratory, and visual–vibratory cues are provided to aid in ground obstacle avoidance.	Semantic Scholar
The wearable system applies vibrotactile cues to the feet and visual cues through augmented reality glasses to convey obstacle location and proximity.	Semantic Scholar
Participants (n = 16) performed an overground obstacle avoidance task with the multimodal device.	Semantic Scholar
Performance metrics included completion time, subjective workload, head-down time, collisions, as well as gait parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Results indicate that information displays enhance task performance, with the visual-only display promoting the least head-down time over tactile-only or visual–tactile displays.	Semantic Scholar
Head-down time was the highest for trials without a display.	Semantic Scholar
Results provide implications for presenting information during physically active tasks such as suited obstacle avoidance.	Semantic Scholar
We present an approach for weakly supervised learning of human actions from video transcriptions.	Semantic Scholar
Our system is based on the idea that, given a sequence of input data and a transcript, i.e.	Semantic Scholar
a list of the order the actions occur in the video, it is possible to infer the actions within the video stream and to learn the related action models without the need for any frame-based annotation.	Semantic Scholar
Starting from the transcript information at hand, we split the given data sequences uniformly based on the number of expected actions.	Semantic Scholar
We then learn action models for each class by maximizing the probability that the training video sequences are generated by the action models given the sequence order as defined by the transcripts.	Semantic Scholar
The learned model can be used to temporally segment an unseen video with or without transcript.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, the inferred segments can be used as a starting point to train high-level fully supervised models.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our approach on four distinct activity datasets, namely Hollywood Extended, MPII Cooking, Breakfast and CRIM13.	Semantic Scholar
It shows that the proposed system is able to align the scripted actions with the video data, that the learned models localize and classify actions in the datasets, and that they outperform any current state-of-the-art approach for aligning transcripts with video data.	Semantic Scholar
Operant learning is learning based on reinforcement of behaviours.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a new hypothesis for operant learning at the single neuron level based on spontaneous fluctuations of synaptic strength caused by receptor dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
These fluctuations allow the neural system to explore a space of outputs.	Semantic Scholar
If the receptor dynamics are altered by a reinforcement signal the neural system settles to better states, i.e., to match the environmental dynamics that determine reward.	Semantic Scholar
Simulations show that this mechanism can support operant learning in a feed-forward neural circuit, a recurrent neural circuit, and a spiking neural circuit controlling an agent learning in a dynamic reward and punishment situation.	Semantic Scholar
We discuss how the new principle relates to existing learning rules and observed phenomena of short and long-term potentiation.	Semantic Scholar
Hand–eye calibration, which consists in identifying the rigid-body transformation between a camera mounted on the robot end-effector and the end-effector itself, is a fundamental problem in robot vision.	Semantic Scholar

Experiments involving synthetic and real calibration data confirm that our approach can predict the covariance of the hand–eye transformation with excellent precision.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a novel robotic manipulation technique that we call robotic edge rolling.	Semantic Scholar
It refers to transporting a cylindrical object by rolling on its circular edge, as human workers might maneuver a gas cylinder on the ground.	Semantic Scholar
Our robotic edge rolling is achieved by controlling the object to both roll on its bottom edge in contact with the ground and slide on the surface of the robot's end effector.	Semantic Scholar
It can thus be regarded as a form of robotic dexterous, in-hand manipulation with nonprehensile grasps.	Semantic Scholar
We address the problem of grasp planning for edge rolling by studying how to design appropriately shaped end effectors with zero internal mobility and how to find feasible grasps for stably rolling the object quasi-dynamically with our simple end effectors.	Semantic Scholar
An extensive set of experiments is performed with a conventional manipulator arm on not only flat surfaces but also a U-shaped half-pipe track.	Semantic Scholar
Long-range edge rolling is demonstrated with a modular mobile manipulator that is capable of active steering control.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a novel approach to the fabrication of a soft robotic hand with contact feedback for grasping delicate objects.	Semantic Scholar
Each finger has a multilayered structure, consisting of a main structure and sensing elements.	Semantic Scholar
The main structure includes a softer layer much thicker than a stiffer layer.	Semantic Scholar
The gripping energy of the fingers is generated from the elastic energy of the prestretched softer layers, and controlled by simple tendon strings pulled/released by a single actuation.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the prestretching and the difference in moduli among layers, the shape/posture of the fingers in stable state is similar to that of soft fingers actuated by pressurization.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we were able to design a soft-fingered hand for different applications by changing the morphological shape of layers.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the hand includes a soft, flexible, and stretchable sensing element for the detection of contact and applied force, which can also be used in other designs of soft fingers.	Semantic Scholar
We assessed the ability of the proposed soft hand to grasp food products with feedback of contact location.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results showed that the proposed hand could safely grasp light and delicate objects, such as fruits, and that it could possibly distinguish among objects based on feedback from sensors.	Semantic Scholar
The design proposed in this paper may give rise to other soft hand designs, along with the possibility of using morphological imbalanced deformation of multilayered structures in soft robotics research.	Semantic Scholar
Over the past decade, the rate of care unit (CU) use in the United States has been increasing.	Semantic Scholar
With an aging population and ever-growing demand for medical care, effective management of patients' transitions among different care facilities will prove indispensible for shortening the length of hospital stays, improving patient outcomes, allocating critical care resources, and reducing preventable re-admissions.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we focus on an important problem of predicting the so-called “patient flow” from longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), which has not been explored via existing machine learning techniques.	Semantic Scholar
By treating a sequence of transition events as a point process, we develop a novel framework for modeling patient flow through various CUs and jointly predicting patients' destination CUs and duration days.	Semantic Scholar
Instead of learning a generative point process model via maximum likelihood estimation, we propose a novel discriminative learning algorithm aiming at improving the prediction of transition events in the case of sparse data.	Semantic Scholar
By parameterizing the proposed model as a mutually-correcting process, we formulate the estimation problem via generalized linear models, which lends itself to efficient learning based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we achieve simultaneous feature selection and learning by adding a group-lasso regularizer to the ADMM algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, for suppressing the negative influence of data imbalance on the learning of model, we synthesize auxiliary training data for the classes with extremely few samples, and improve the robustness of our learning method accordingly.	Semantic Scholar
Testing on real-world data, we show that our method obtains superior performance in terms of accuracy of predicting the destination CU transition and duration of each CU occupancy.	Semantic Scholar
Deep learning models for video-based action recognition usually generate features for short clips (consisting of a few frames); such clip-level features are aggregated to video-level representations by computing statistics on these features.	Semantic Scholar
Typically zero-th (max) or the first-order (average) statistics are used.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we explore the benefits of using second-order statistics.Specifically, we propose a novel end-to-end learnable feature aggregation scheme, dubbed temporal correlation pooling that generates an action descriptor for a video sequence by capturing the similarities between the temporal evolution of clip-level CNN features computed across the video.	Semantic Scholar
Such a descriptor, while being computationally cheap, also naturally encodes the co-activations of multiple CNN features, thereby providing a richer characterization of actions than their first-order counterparts.	Semantic Scholar
We also propose higher-order extensions of this scheme by computing correlations after embedding the CNN features in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space.	Semantic Scholar
We provide experiments on benchmark datasets such as HMDB-51 and UCF-101, fine-grained datasets such as MPII Cooking activities and JHMDB, as well as the recent Kinetics-600.	Semantic Scholar
Our results demonstrate the advantages of higher-order pooling schemes that when combined with hand-crafted features (as is standard practice) achieves state-of-the-art accuracy.	Semantic Scholar

The Denavit–Hartenberg (D–H) model and the product of exponentials (POE) model have been two popular methods for modeling the kinematics of a serial-link robot.	Semantic Scholar
While these two models are equivalent in essence, no study has revealed how to convert from the POE model to the D–H model.	Semantic Scholar
The conversion enables direct utilization of established algorithms formulated with D–H parameters or compensation of the D–H model after calibration with the POE parameters.	Semantic Scholar
It also provides a simpler method to determine the D–H parameters of a robot.	Semantic Scholar
For these reasons, this letter proposes an analytic approach to automatically convert a group of POE parameters into the associated D–H parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Three lemmas are proved for the derivation of the final algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
An implementation of the algorithm in MATLAB is provided as well.	Semantic Scholar
The current practice of intraoperative ultrasound requires an assistant because the surgeon's hands are occupied with surgical tools or console instruments.	Semantic Scholar
This process can be tedious and prone to error.	Semantic Scholar
Eye gaze is a promising control modality that can help address this issue.	Semantic Scholar
In previous work, a novel feature-based retro-fit eye gaze tracker has been designed for the <italic>da Vinci</italic> surgical system.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, leveraging the <italic>da Vinci</italic> research kit, three interfaces incorporate eye gaze, and voice recognition into the <italic> da Vinci</italic> surgical system for ultrasound control in one common framework.	Semantic Scholar
This letter aims to improve autonomous use of ultrasound for surgeons.	Semantic Scholar
Since eye gaze tracking is sensitive to head movement, a novel calibration procedure is also proposed to accommodate head motion by decomposing pupil movement into eye rotation and head motion.	Semantic Scholar
This ensures that the eye gaze tracking can be reliably used as a control modality.	Semantic Scholar
"A user study (<italic>N</italic> = 20) has shown that the designed eye gaze tracker has a mean binocular accuracy of 1.98<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$^{\circ }$</tex-math></inline-formula> with mean <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX""> $-$</tex-math></inline-formula>0.92 mm horizontal and 16.83-mm vertical head movement."

A preliminary user study ( <italic>N</italic> = 9) has shown that eye gaze tracking for ultrasound control has the potential to improve the way surgeons interact with their instrumentation and increase surgical autonomy.	Semantic Scholar
Core decomposition is a fundamental graph problem with a large number of applications.	Semantic Scholar
Most existing approaches for core decomposition assume that the graph is kept in memory of a machine.	Semantic Scholar
Nevertheless, many real-world graphs are too big to reside in memory.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study I/O efficient core decomposition following a semi-external model, which only allows node information to be loaded in memory.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a semi-external algorithm and an optimized algorithm for I/O efficient core decomposition.	Semantic Scholar
To handle dynamic graph updates, we firstly show that our algorithm can be naturally extended to handle edge deletion.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we propose an I/O efficient core maintenance algorithm to handle edge insertion, and an improved algorithm to further reduce I/O and CPU cost.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, based on our core decomposition algorithms, we further propose an I/O efficient semi-external algorithm for degeneracy ordering, which is an important graph problem that is highly related to core decomposition.	Semantic Scholar
We also consider how to maintain the degeneracy order.	Semantic Scholar
We conduct extensive experiments on 12 real large graphs.	Semantic Scholar
Our optimal core decomposition algorithm significantly outperforms the existing I/O efficient algorithm in terms of both processing time and memory consumption.	Semantic Scholar
They are very scalable to handle web-scale graphs.	Semantic Scholar
As an example, we are the first to handle a web graph with 978.5 million nodes and 42.6 billion edges using less than 4.2 GB memory.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that our proposed algorithms for degeneracy order computation and maintenance can handle big graphs efficiently with small memory overhead.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter we present a control and trajectory tracking approach for wiping the train cab front panels, using a velocity controlled robotic manipulator and a force/torque sensor attached to its end effector, without using any surface model or vision-based surface detection.	Semantic Scholar
The control strategy consists in a simultaneous position and force controller, adapted from the operational space formulation, that aligns the cleaning tool with the surface normal, maintaining a set-point normal force, while simultaneously moving along the surface.	Semantic Scholar
The trajectory tracking strategy consists in specifying and tracking a two dimensional path that, when projected onto the train surface, corresponds to the desired pattern of motion.	Semantic Scholar
We first validated our approach using the Baxter robot to wipe a highly curved surface with both a spiral and a raster scan motion patterns.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we implemented the same approach in a scaled robot prototype, specifically designed by ourselves to wipe a $1/8$  scaled version of a train cab front, using a raster scan pattern.	Semantic Scholar
A novel approach to estimating the detailed shape of arbitrary extended objects jointly with their kinematics in the absence of a priori information is presented.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed shape model represents the tightest enclosing bound of the object projected into the ego motion plane as a polygon with an unknown number of vertices.	Semantic Scholar
Probabilistic inference techniques are employed to overcome various sources of uncertainty by rigorously estimating the joint distribution over the object shape and kinematic states, rather than estimating these variables directly.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation and experimental results are presented for objects with complex shapes tracked from an autonomous vehicle research platform.	Semantic Scholar
In addition to providing a richer set of information for higher level reasoning about extended objects (e.g.	Semantic Scholar
about object type, or occupied space), the results demonstrate that detailed shape estimates enable efficient use of sensor information by way of explicit surface-based sensor models; this efficient use of sensor information improves observability of latent object states, thereby improving tracking precision.

Several researchers around the world have studied gesture recognition, but most of the recent techniques fall in the curse of dimensionality and are not useful in real time environment.	Semantic Scholar

How to build a biomimetic robot fish has always been a divergent question.	Semantic Scholar
Most of the existing robot fishes suffer structural complexity and propulsive inefficiency.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we proposed a method that transfers the natural actuation properties of fish to the biomimetic robot counterpart.	Semantic Scholar
The natural properties were analyzed based on the Lighthill fish swimming model and the actuation function of fish muscles.	Semantic Scholar
The analyses shown that the compliant part is feasible in fish propulsion, which means nonactuated/compliant part is also feasible to achieve an effective propulsion on robot fish, and an example of this type of robot fish and its general kinematic model are presented.	Semantic Scholar
This transform method not only can demonstrate the actuation features of fish, but also can reduce the motors in building robot fish.	Semantic Scholar
The method has also been extended to apply on different swimming modes, offering a general guidance to build efficient biomimetic robot fishes with fewer motors.	Semantic Scholar
Re-identification is generally carried out by encoding the appearance of a subject in terms of outfit, suggesting scenarios where people do not change their attire.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we overcome this restriction, by proposing a framework based on a deep convolutional neural network, SOMAnet, that additionally models other discriminative aspects, namely, structural attributes of the human figure (e.g.	Semantic Scholar
height, obesity, gender).	Semantic Scholar
Our method is unique in many respects.	Semantic Scholar
First, SOMAnet is based on the Inception architecture, departing from the usual siamese framework.	Semantic Scholar
This spares expensive data preparation (pairing images across cameras) and allows the understanding of what the network learned.	Semantic Scholar
Second, and most notably, the training data consists of a synthetic 100K instance dataset, SOMAset, created by photorealistic human body generation software.	Semantic Scholar
Synthetic data represents a good compromise between realistic imagery, usually not required in re-identification since surveillance cameras capture low-resolution silhouettes, and complete control of the samples, which is useful in order to customize the data w.r.t.	Semantic Scholar
the surveillance scenario at-hand, e.g.	Semantic Scholar

SOMAnet, trained on SOMAset and fine-tuned on recent re-identification benchmarks, outperforms all competitors, matching subjects even with different apparel.	Semantic Scholar
The combination of synthetic data with Inception architectures opens up new research avenues in re-identification.	Semantic Scholar
Integrity constraint based data repairing is an iterative process consisting of two parts: detect and group errors that violate given integrity constraints (ICs); and modify values inside each group such that the modified database satisfies those ICs.	Semantic Scholar
However, most existing automatic solutions treat the process of detecting and grouping errors straightforwardly (e.g., violations of functional dependencies using string equality), while putting more attention on heuristics of modifying values within each group.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a revised semantics of violations  and data consistency w.r.t.	Semantic Scholar
a set of ICs.	Semantic Scholar
The revised semantics relies on string similarities, in contrast to traditional methods that use syntactic error detection using string equality.	Semantic Scholar
Along with the revised semantics, we also propose a new cost model to quantify the cost of data repair by considering distances between strings.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the revised semantics provides a significant change for better detecting and grouping errors, which in turn improves both precision and recall of the following data repairing step.	Semantic Scholar
We prove that finding minimum-cost repairs in the new model is NP-hard, even for a single FD.	Semantic Scholar
We devise efficient algorithms to find approximate repairs.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we develop indices and optimization techniques to improve the efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing automatic repair algorithms in both precision and recall.	Semantic Scholar
This paper investigates the incorporation of hidden conditional random fields (HCRF) as a discriminative statistical modeling technique into adaptive haptic guidance (HG) for physical human-robot interaction (pHRI).	Semantic Scholar
In this gesture-based HG approach, the knowledge and experience of experts are modeled to improve the unpredictable motions of novice trainees in a virtual minimally invasive surgery (MIS) training task.	Semantic Scholar
The HCRF models are developed for automatic gesture recognition and segmentation as well as generating guidance forces.	Semantic Scholar
The forces are adaptively calculated in real time with respect to gestural similarities among user motions and the gesture models.	Semantic Scholar
The HCRF-based approach is compared with a hidden Markov model-based (HMM-based) method for capturing the gestures of the user and providing adaptive HG.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results show that the HCRF, as a discriminative method, can outperform HMM, as a generative method, in terms of user performance.	Semantic Scholar

In particular, we show that MED can be applied to NDCG without requiring an <italic>a priori</italic> assumption in regard to the total number of relevant documents; we also show that making such an assumption leads to different outcomes for both NDCG and average precision (AP) compared to when no such assumption is made.

Guessing what user may like is now a typical interface for video recommendation.	Semantic Scholar
Nowadays, the highly popular user generated content sites provide various sources of information such as tags for recommendation tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Motivated by a real world online video recommendation problem, this work targets at the long tail phenomena of user behavior and the sparsity of item features.	Semantic Scholar
A personalized compound recommendation framework for online video recommendation called Dirichlet mixture probit model for information scarcity (DPIS) is hence proposed.	Semantic Scholar
Assuming that each clicking sample is generated from a representation of user preferences, DPIS models the sample level topic proportions as a multinomial item vector, and utilizes topical clustering on the user part for recommendation through a probit classifier.	Semantic Scholar
As demonstrated by the real-world application, the proposed DPIS achieves better performance in accuracy, perplexity as well as diversity in coverage than traditional methods.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a nonparametric procedure to achieve fast inference in generative graphical models when the number of latent states is very large.	Semantic Scholar
The approach is based on iterative latent variable preselection, where we alternate between learning a selection function to reveal the relevant latent variables and using this to obtain a compact approximation of the posterior distribution for EM.	Semantic Scholar
This can make inference possible where the number of possible latent states is, for example, exponential in the number of latent variables, whereas an exact approach would be computationally infeasible.	Semantic Scholar
We learn the selection function entirely from the observed data and current expectation-maximization state via gaussian process regression.	Semantic Scholar
This is in contrast to earlier approaches, where selection functions were manually designed for each problem setting.	Semantic Scholar
We show that our approach performs as well as these bespoke selection functions on a wide variety of inference problems.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, for the challenging case of a hierarchical model for object localization with occlusion, we achieve results that match a customized state-of-the-art selection method at a far lower computational cost.	Semantic Scholar
Current approaches for visual--inertial odometry (VIO) are able to attain highly accurate state estimation via nonlinear optimization.	Semantic Scholar
However, real-time optimization quickly becomes infeasible as the trajectory grows over time; this problem is further emphasized by the fact that inertial measurements come at high rate, hence, leading to the fast growth of the number of variables in the optimization.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we address this issue by preintegrating inertial measurements between selected keyframes into single relative motion constraints.	Semantic Scholar
Our first contribution is a preintegration theory that properly addresses the manifold structure of the rotation group.	Semantic Scholar
We formally discuss the generative measurement model as well as the nature of the rotation noise and derive the expression for the maximum a posteriori state estimator.	Semantic Scholar
Our theoretical development enables the computation of all necessary Jacobians for the optimization and a posteriori bias correction in analytic form.	Semantic Scholar
The second contribution is to show that the preintegrated inertial measurement unit model can be seamlessly integrated into a visual--inertial pipeline under the unifying framework of factor graphs.	Semantic Scholar
This enables the application of incremental-smoothing algorithms and the use of a structureless model for visual measurements, which avoids optimizing over the 3-D points, further accelerating the computation.	Semantic Scholar
We perform an extensive evaluation of our monocular VIO pipeline on real and simulated datasets.	Semantic Scholar
The results confirm that our modeling effort leads to an accurate state estimation in real time, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.	Semantic Scholar
We present the focal flow sensor.	Semantic Scholar
It is an unactuated, monocular camera that simultaneously exploits defocus and differential motion to measure a depth map and a 3D scene velocity field.	Semantic Scholar
It does this using an optical-flow-like, per-pixel linear constraint that relates image derivatives to depth and velocity.	Semantic Scholar
We derive this constraint, prove its invariance to scene texture, and prove that it is exactly satisfied only when the sensor’s blur kernels are Gaussian.	Semantic Scholar
We analyze the inherent sensitivity of the focal flow cue, and we build and test a prototype.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments produce useful depth and velocity information for a broader set of aperture configurations, including a simple lens with a pillbox aperture.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a comprehensive control scheme tailored to the task of letting a formation of omnidirectional mobile robots transport a plate through an unknown environment purely by normal and friction forces between the robots and the plate.	Semantic Scholar
The scheme includes a graph-based path planning strategy that can deal with obstacles of arbitrary polygonal shapes without any discretization of the environment.	Semantic Scholar
The strategy permits a natural implementation of a memory functionality that allows the robots to navigate through maze-like environments by successively constructing an approximative map of the environment during the motion.	Semantic Scholar
Most characteristic for the proposed approach, the robots are controlled using distributed model predictive control which makes it possible to enforce constraints on the movements of the robots to allow for a successful transportation of the plate with only acceptable slipping between the robots and the plate.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed scheme is carefully and successfully tested in various simulations posing rather sophisticated challenges both to its navigation and formation control subaspects.	Semantic Scholar
We present a novel frequency-domain image registration technique, which employs histograms of oriented gradients providing subpixel estimates.	Semantic Scholar
Our method involves image filtering using dense Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), which provides an advanced representation of the images coping with real-world registration problems such as non-overlapping regions and small deformations.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed representation retains the orientation information and the corresponding weights in a multi-dimensional representation.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, due to the overlapping local contrast normalization characteristic of HOG, the proposed Histogram of Oriented Gradients Phase Correlation (HOG-PC) method improves significantly the estimated motion parameters in small size blocks.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments using sequences with and without ground truth including both global and local/multiple motions demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art in frequency-domain motion estimation, in the shape of phase correlation, in terms of subpixel accuracy and motion compensation prediction for a range of test material, block sizes and motion scenarios.

To develop an advanced human-robot interaction system, it is important to first understand how human beings learn to perceive, think, and act in an ever-changing world.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose an intention understanding system that uses an Object Augmented-Supervised Multiple Timescale Recurrent Neural Network (OA-SMTRNN) and demonstrate the effects of perception-action connected learning in an artificial agent, which is inspired by psychological and neurological phenomena in humans.	Semantic Scholar
We believe that action and perception are not isolated processes in human mental development, and argue that these psychological and neurological interactions can be replicated in a human-machine scenario.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed OA-SMTRNN consists of perception and action modules and their connection, which are constructed of supervised multiple timescale recurrent neural networks and the deep auto-encoder, respectively, and connects their perception and action for understanding human intention.	Semantic Scholar
Our experimental results show the effects of perception-action connected learning, and demonstrate that robots can understand human intention with OA-SMTRNN through perception-action connected learning.	Semantic Scholar
A measure of fault tolerance for different joint failure probabilities is defined based on the properties of the singular values of the Jacobian after failures.	Semantic Scholar
Using this measure, methods to design optimally fault tolerant robots for an arbitrary set of joint failure probabilities and multiple cases of joint failure probabilities are introduced separately.	Semantic Scholar
Given an arbitrary set of joint failure probabilities, the optimal null space that optimizes the fault tolerant measure is derived, and the associated isotropic Jacobians are constructed.	Semantic Scholar
The kinematic parameters of the optimally fault tolerant robots are then generated from these Jacobians.	Semantic Scholar
One special case, i.e., how to construct the optimal Jacobian of spatial 7R robots for both positioning and orienting is further discussed.	Semantic Scholar
For multiple cases of joint failure probabilities, the optimal robot is designed through optimizing the sum of the fault tolerant measures for all the possible joint failure probabilities.	Semantic Scholar
This technique is illustrated on planar 3R robots, and it is shown that there exists a family of optimal robots.	Semantic Scholar
In many engineering problems, including those related to robotics, optimization of the control policy for multiple conflicting criteria is required.	Semantic Scholar
However, this can be very challenging because of the existence of noise, which may be input dependent or heteroscedastic, and restrictions regarding the number of evaluations owing to the costliness of the experiments in terms of time and/or money.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a multiobjective optimization algorithm for expensive-to-evaluate noisy functions for robotics.	Semantic Scholar
We present a method for model selection between heteroscedastic and standard homoscedastic Gaussian process regression techniques to create suitable surrogate functions from noisy samples, and to find the point to be observed at the next step.	Semantic Scholar
This algorithm is compared against an existing multiobjective optimization algorithm, and then used to optimize the speed and head stability of the sidewinding gait of a snake robot.	Semantic Scholar
Given a sequence of snapshots of flu propagating over a population network, can we find a segmentation when the patterns of the disease spread change, possibly due to interventions?	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study the problem of segmenting graph sequences with labeled nodes.	Semantic Scholar
Memes on the Twitter network, diseases over a contact network, movie-cascades over a social network, etc.	Semantic Scholar
are all graph sequences with labeled nodes.	Semantic Scholar
Most related work on this subject is on plain graphs and hence ignores the label dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
Others require fix parameters or feature engineering.	Semantic Scholar
We propose SnapNETS, to automatically find segmentations of such graph sequences, with different characteristics of nodes of each label in adjacent segments.	Semantic Scholar
It satisfies all the desired properties (being parameter free, comprehensive and scalable) by leveraging a principled, multi-level, flexible framework which maps the problem to a path optimization problem over a weighted DAG.	Semantic Scholar
Also, we develop the parallel framework of SnapNETS  which speeds up its running time.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we propose an extension of SnapNETS to handle the dynamic graph structures and use it to detect anomalies (and events) in network sequences.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on several diverse real datasets show that it finds cut points matching ground-truth or meaningful external signals and detects anomalies outperforming non-trivial baselines.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that the segmentations are easily interpretable, and that SnapNETS scales near-linearly with the size of the input.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we show how to use SnapNETS to detect anomaly in a sequence of dynamic networks.	Semantic Scholar

Physical human–robot collaboration is becoming more common, both in industrial and service robotics.	Semantic Scholar
Cooperative execution of a task requires intuitive and efficient interaction between both actors.	Semantic Scholar
For humans, this means being able to predict and adapt to robot movements.	Semantic Scholar
Given that natural human movement exhibits several robust features, we examined whether human–robot physical interaction is facilitated when these features are considered in robot control.	Semantic Scholar
The present study investigated how humans adapt to biological and nonbiological velocity patterns in robot movements.	Semantic Scholar
Participants held the end-effector of a robot that traced an elliptic path with either biological (two-thirds power law) or nonbiological velocity profiles.	Semantic Scholar
Participants were instructed to minimize the force applied on the robot end-effector.	Semantic Scholar
Results showed that the applied force was significantly lower when the robot moved with a biological velocity pattern.	Semantic Scholar
With extensive practice and enhanced feedback, participants were able to decrease their force when following a nonbiological velocity pattern, but never reached forces below those obtained with the 2/3 power law profile.	Semantic Scholar
These results suggest that some robust features observed in natural human movements are also a strong preference in guided movements.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, such features should be considered in human–robot physical collaboration.	Semantic Scholar

Modern robotic systems are often equipped with a direct three-dimensional (3-D) data acquisition device, e.g., LiDAR, which provides a rich 3-D point cloud representation of the surroundings.	Semantic Scholar
This representation is commonly used for obstacle avoidance and mapping.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we propose a new approach for using point clouds for another critical robotic capability, semantic understanding of the environment (i.e., object classification).	Semantic Scholar
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), that perform extremely well for object classification in 2-D images, are not easily extendible to 3-D point clouds analysis.	Semantic Scholar
It is not straightforward due to point clouds’ irregular format and a varying number of points.	Semantic Scholar
The common solution of transforming the point cloud data into a 3-D voxel grid needs to address severe accuracy versus memory size tradeoffs.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a novel, intuitively interpretable, 3-D point cloud representation called 3-D modified Fisher vectors.	Semantic Scholar
Our representation is hybrid as it combines a coarse discrete grid structure with continuous generalized Fisher vectors.	Semantic Scholar
Using the grid enables us to design a new CNN architecture for real-time point cloud classification.	Semantic Scholar
In a series of performance analysis experiments, we demonstrate competitive results or even better than state of the art on challenging benchmark datasets while maintaining robustness to various data corruptions.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents an approach that combines geometry processing with motion planning to enable a robot to efficiently navigate in unstructured environments.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach relies on a novel oversegmentation method to produce a decomposition of the free space into a set of connected regions.	Semantic Scholar

Visual saliency analysis detects salient regions/objects that attract human attention in natural scenes.	Semantic Scholar
It has attracted intensive research in different fields such as computer vision, computer graphics, and multimedia.	Semantic Scholar
While many such computational models exist, the focused study of what and how applications can be beneficial is still lacking.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, our ultimate goal is thus to provide a comprehensive review of the applications using saliency cues, the so-called attentive systems.	Semantic Scholar
We would like to provide a broad vision about saliency applications and what visual saliency can do.	Semantic Scholar
We categorize the vast amount of applications into different areas such as computer vision, computer graphics, and multimedia.	Semantic Scholar
Intensively covering 200+ publications we survey (1) key application trends, (2) the role of visual saliency, and (3) the usability of saliency into different tasks.	Semantic Scholar
In recent years, multilabel classification has attracted significant attention in multimedia annotation.	Semantic Scholar
However, most of the multilabel classification methods focus only on the inherent correlations existing among multiple labels and concepts and ignore the relevance between features and the target concepts.	Semantic Scholar
To obtain more robust multilabel classification results, we propose a new multilabel classification method aiming to capture the correlations among multiple concepts by leveraging hypergraph that is proved to be beneficial for relational learning.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we consider mining feature-concept relevance, which is often overlooked by many multilabel learning algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
To better show the feature-concept relevance, we impose a sparsity constraint on the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
We compare the proposed method with several other multilabel classification methods and evaluate the classification performance by mean average precision on several data sets.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
We aim to model the top-down attention of a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier for generating task-specific attention maps.	Semantic Scholar
Inspired by a top-down human visual attention model, we propose a new backpropagation scheme, called Excitation Backprop, to pass along top-down signals downwards in the network hierarchy via a probabilistic Winner-Take-All process.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we introduce the concept of contrastive attention to make the top-down attention maps more discriminative.	Semantic Scholar
We show a theoretic connection between the proposed contrastive attention formulation and the Class Activation Map computation.	Semantic Scholar
Efficient implementation of Excitation Backprop for common neural network layers is also presented.	Semantic Scholar
In experiments, we visualize the evidence of a model’s classification decision by computing the proposed top-down attention maps.	Semantic Scholar
For quantitative evaluation, we report the accuracy of our method in weakly supervised localization tasks on the MS COCO, PASCAL VOC07 and ImageNet datasets.	Semantic Scholar
The usefulness of our method is further validated in the text-to-region association task.	Semantic Scholar
On the Flickr30k Entities dataset, we achieve promising performance in phrase localization by leveraging the top-down attention of a CNN model that has been trained on weakly labeled web images.	Semantic Scholar

This paper develops a general framework of statistical inference on discrete sample spaces, on which a neighborhood system is defined by an undirected graph.	Semantic Scholar
The scoring rule is a measure of the goodness of fit for the model to observed samples, and we employ its localized version, local scoring rules, which does not require the normalization constant.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the local scoring rule is closely related to a discrepancy measure called composite local Bregman divergence.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we investigate the statistical consistency of local scoring rules in terms of the graphical structure of the sample space.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we propose a robust and computationally efficient estimator based on our framework.	Semantic Scholar
In numerical experiments, we investigate the relation between the neighborhood system and estimation accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
Also, we numerically evaluate the robustness of localized estimators.	Semantic Scholar

Existing algorithms support this type of queries via incrementally maintaining a subset of objects in the window and try to retrieve the answer from this subset as much as possible whenever the window slides.	Semantic Scholar
However, since all the existing algorithms are sensitive to query parameters and data distribution, they all suffer from expensive incremental maintenance cost.	Semantic Scholar

This letter presents a planning system for autonomous driving among many pedestrians.	Semantic Scholar
A key ingredient of our approach is Pedestrian Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance, a pedestrian motion prediction model that accounts for both a pedestrian's global navigation intention and local interactions with the vehicle and other pedestrians.	Semantic Scholar
Unfortunately, the autonomous vehicle does not know the pedestrians’ intentions a priori and requires a planning algorithm that hedges against the uncertainty in pedestrian intentions.	Semantic Scholar
Our planning system combines a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process algorithm with the pedestrian motion model and runs in real time.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments show that it enables a robot scooter to drive safely, efficiently, and smoothly in a crowd with a density of nearly one person per square meter.	Semantic Scholar
Interpersonal relation defines the association, e.g., warm, friendliness, and dominance, between two or more people.	Semantic Scholar
We investigate if such fine-grained and high-level relation traits can be characterized and quantified from face images in the wild.	Semantic Scholar
We address this challenging problem by first studying a deep network architecture for robust recognition of facial expressions.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike existing models that typically learn from facial expression labels alone, we devise an effective multitask network that is capable of learning from rich auxiliary attributes such as gender, age, and head pose, beyond just facial expression data.	Semantic Scholar
While conventional supervised training requires datasets with complete labels (e.g., all samples must be labeled with gender, age, and expression), we show that this requirement can be relaxed via a novel attribute propagation method.	Semantic Scholar
The approach further allows us to leverage the inherent correspondences between heterogeneous attribute sources despite the disparate distributions of different datasets.	Semantic Scholar
With the network we demonstrate state-of-the-art results on existing facial expression recognition benchmarks.	Semantic Scholar
To predict inter-personal relation, we use the expression recognition network as branches for a Siamese model.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments show that our model is capable of mining mutual context of faces for accurate fine-grained interpersonal prediction.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present an end effector that can drill holes compliant to aeronautic standards while mounted on a lightweight robot arm.	Semantic Scholar
There is an unmet demand for a robotic solution capable of drilling inside an aircraft fuselage, as size, weight, and space constraints disqualify current commercial solutions for this task.	Semantic Scholar
Our main contribution is the mechanical design of the end effector with high-friction, vibration-reducing feet that are pressed against the workpiece during the drilling process to increase stability, and a separate linear actuator to advance the drill.	Semantic Scholar
This relieves the robot arm of the task of advancing and stabilizing the drill, and leaves it with the task of positioning and holding the end effector.	Semantic Scholar
The stabilizing properties of the end effector are confirmed experimentally.	Semantic Scholar
The solution took first place at the Airbus Shopfloor Challenge, an international robotics competition held at ICRA 2016 that modeled the in-fuselage drilling task.	Semantic Scholar
The massive collection of data via emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) requires finding optimal ways to reduce the observations in the time series analysis domain.	Semantic Scholar
The IoT time series require aggregation methods that can preserve and represent the key characteristics of the data.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a segmentation algorithm that adapts to unannounced mutations of the data (i.e., data drifts).	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm splits the data streams into blocks and groups them in square matrices, computes the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and quantizes them.	Semantic Scholar
The key information is contained in the upper-left part of the resulting matrix.	Semantic Scholar
We extract this sub-matrix, compute the modulus of its eigenvalues, and remove duplicates.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm, called BEATS, is designed to tackle dynamic IoT streams, whose distribution changes over time.	Semantic Scholar
We implement experiments with six datasets combining real, synthetic, real-world data, and data with drifts.	Semantic Scholar
Compared to other segmentation methods like Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX), BEATS shows significant improvements.	Semantic Scholar
Trying it with classification and clustering algorithms it provides efficient results.	Semantic Scholar
BEATS is an effective mechanism to work with dynamic and multi-variate data, making it suitable for IoT data sources.	Semantic Scholar
The datasets, code of the algorithm and the analysis results can be accessed publicly at:  https://github.com/auroragonzalez/BEATS.	Semantic Scholar
Robotic manipulation often requires adaptation to changing environments.	Semantic Scholar
Such changes can be represented by a certain number of contextual variables that may be observed or sensed in different manners.	Semantic Scholar
When learning and representing robot motion—usually with movement primitives, it is desirable to adapt the learned behaviors to the current context.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, different actions or motions can be considered in the same framework, using contextualization to decide which action applies to which situation.	Semantic Scholar
Such frameworks, however, may easily become large dimensional; thus, requiring to reduce the dimensionality of the parameters space, as well as the amount of data needed to generate and improve the model over experience.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose an approach to obtain a generative model from a set of actions that share a common feature.	Semantic Scholar
Such feature, namely a contextual variable, is plugged into the model to generate motion.	Semantic Scholar
We encode the data with a Gaussian Mixture Model in the parameter space of probabilistic movement primitives, after performing dimensionality reduction on such parameter space.	Semantic Scholar
We append the contextual variable to the parameter space and obtain the number of Gaussian components, i.e., different actions in a dataset, through persistent homology.	Semantic Scholar
Then, using multimodal Gaussian mixture regression we can retrieve the most likely actions given a contextual situation and execute them.	Semantic Scholar
After actions are executed, we use reward-weighted responsibility GMM update the model after each execution.	Semantic Scholar
Experimentation in three scenarios shows that the method drastically reduces the dimensionality of the parameter space; thus, implementing both action selection and adaptation to a changing situation in an efficient way.	Semantic Scholar
Learning-based approaches are suitable for the control of systems with unknown dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
However, learning from scratch involves many trials with exploratory actions until a good control policy is discovered.	Semantic Scholar
Real robots usually cannot withstand the exploratory actions and suffer damage.	Semantic Scholar
This problem can be circumvented by combining learning with a model-based control.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we employ a nominal model-predictive controller that is impeded by the presence of an unknown model-plant mismatch.	Semantic Scholar
To compensate for the mismatch, we propose two approaches of combining reinforcement learning with the nominal controller.	Semantic Scholar
The first approach learns a compensatory control action that minimizes the same performance measure as is minimized by the nominal controller.	Semantic Scholar
The second approach learns a compensatory signal from a difference of a transition predicted by the internal model and an actual transition.	Semantic Scholar
We compare the approaches on a robot attached to the ground and performing a setpoint reaching task in simulations.	Semantic Scholar
We implement the better approach on the real robot and demonstrate successful learning results.	Semantic Scholar
With the trend of even smaller workpieces and complicated processes in the semiconductor industry, yield enhancement becomes the crucial indicator of enterprise profits.	Semantic Scholar
However, the advancement of the manufacturing processes results in huge-and-complicated data, it becomes difficult to quickly search for the root causes that affect the yield from such big historical data.	Semantic Scholar
In light of this, the authors proposed the key-variable search algorithm (KSA) to resolve this problem.	Semantic Scholar
The KSA scheme provides users a quick-and-efficient way to identify the root causes of a yield loss.	Semantic Scholar
The inputs of this KSA scheme include production routes, process data, inline data, defects, and final inspection results.	Semantic Scholar
However, when an interaction effect exists between a key device/variable and the other device/variable, also, the impact of this effect is greater than those impacts of the original devices/variables, the original KSA scheme may not correctly find out the root causes.	Semantic Scholar
To remedy this insufficiency, this study develops the “interaction-effect search algorithm (IESA).” The IESA scheme can not only identify the existence of an interaction effect but also determine the threshold of the key variable that causes this interaction effect.	Semantic Scholar
The analysis of standard cycle times for manual tasks has been an important subject in time and motion studies for developing a standardized work process for which the laborious and continuous observation of tasks using a time measurement instrument was usually required.	Semantic Scholar
In order to automate this procedure, a motion recognition method is proposed to identify the precise start and end times of manual tasks.	Semantic Scholar
To do this, we consider the time series of the hand posture and movement data acquired by a depth-sensing camera.	Semantic Scholar
The pattern of motions made to complete a single task is represented by the sign sequence of wavelet coefficients.	Semantic Scholar
We then extract the start and end times of each individual task from the original time series of repetitive manual tasks; this is done by searching a set of subtime series of unequal scale that has a similar sign sequence as the prespecified reference.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of the proposed procedure is statistically examined by a paired t-test at significance level  $\alpha = 0.05$ in comparison with a conventional video playback analysis.	Semantic Scholar

The objective of NASA’s Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) Concept of Operations (ConOps) is to facilitate high volume operation of advanced small aircraft operating in non-towered, non-radar airports.	Semantic Scholar
This system can provide improved and accessible air travel at a lower cost.	Semantic Scholar
Given the safety-critical nature of SATS, its analysis accuracy is extremely important.	Semantic Scholar
However, the commonly used analysis techniques, like pilot/computer simulation and traditional model checking, do not ascertain an error-free and complete verification of SATS due to the wide range of possibilities involved in SATS or the inability to capture the randomized and unpredictable aspects of the SATS ConOps environment in their models.	Semantic Scholar
Another limitation of these studies is that a limited speed range was used in the analysis.	Semantic Scholar
To overcome these limitations, we propose to formulate the SATS ConOps as a fully synchronous and probabilistic model, i.e., SATS-SMA, that supports simultaneously moving aircraft.	Semantic Scholar
The distinguishing features of our work include the preservation of safety of aircraft while providing a precise timing model, which is closer to reality compared to the previous hybrid analyses.	Semantic Scholar
Important insights related to the aircraft take-off and landing operations during the instrument meteorological conditions are also presented.	Semantic Scholar

One of the main challenges in robot swarming arises from the need to design controllers that guarantee safety and motion planners that guarantee collision avoidance.	Semantic Scholar
This translates into sensors that measure proximity to neighbors and algorithms that scale exponentially with the number of robots.	Semantic Scholar
In many cases, these problems are solved very differently in nature, especially at smaller scales.	Semantic Scholar
The penalty due to collisions is small at these scales and sensors and controllers are not precise enough to guarantee collision-free trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
We explore a similar approach with small flying robots.	Semantic Scholar
We present a design that is capable of sustaining collisions, controllers that are able to recover from collisions, and simple motion planners that allow the robots to navigate without complete knowledge of the environment.	Semantic Scholar
We illustrate the potential of bioinspired swarms using simulations and experimental results.	Semantic Scholar
Nuclear fusion power plants require periodical maintenance, including the remote handling operations of transportation performed by automated guided vehicles (AGV).	Semantic Scholar
The navigation system becomes a key issue given the safety constrains of the heavy load to be transported in the complex scenarios, such as the reactor building.	Semantic Scholar
This work presents well-known and mature navigation technologies used by AGV in industry: with a physical path (e.g., wire/inductive guidance, optical line guidance and magnetic tape guidance) and with a virtual path (e.g., laser based, motion capture, inertial, magneticgyro) to be followed by the AGV during the operations of transportation.	Semantic Scholar
A critical assessment is also presented regarding the performance of these technologies against the operational requirements and safety demonstration in the framework of fusion facilities like ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) or DEMO (DEMOnstration Power Station).

In this paper we propose a fast 3D pose based SLAM system that estimates a vehicle’s trajectory by registering sets of planar surface segments, extracted from 360◦ field of view (FOV) point clouds provided by a 3D LIDAR.	Semantic Scholar
Full FOV and planar representation of the map gives the proposed SLAM system the capability to map large-scale environments while maintaining fast execution time.	Semantic Scholar
For efficient point cloud processing we apply image-based techniques to project it to three two-dimensional images.	Semantic Scholar
The SLAM backend is based on Exactly Sparse Delayed State Filter as a non-iterative way of updating the pose graph and exploiting sparsity of the SLAM information matrix.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, our SLAM system enables reconstruction of the global map by merging the local planar surface segments in a highly efficient way.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed point cloud segmentation and registration method was tested and compared with the several state-of-the-art methods on two publicly available datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Complete SLAM system was also tested in one indoor and one outdoor experiment.	Semantic Scholar
The indoor experiment was conducted using a research mobile robot Husky A200 to map our university building and the outdoor experiment was performed on the publicly available dataset provided by the Ford Motor Company, in which a car equipped with a 3D LIDAR was driven in the downtown Dearborn Michigan.

Dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) are widely used as movement parametrization for learning robot trajectories, because of their linearity in the parameters, rescaling robustness, and continuity.	Semantic Scholar
However, when learning a movement with DMPs, a very large number of Gaussian approximations needs to be performed.	Semantic Scholar
Adding them up for all joints yields too many parameters to be explored when using reinforcement learning (RL), thus requiring a prohibitive number of experiments/simulations to converge to a solution with a (locally or globally) optimal reward.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we address the process of simultaneously learning a DMP-characterized robot motion and its underlying joint couplings through linear dimensionality reduction (DR), which will provide valuable qualitative information leading to a reduced and intuitive algebraic description of such motion.	Semantic Scholar
The results in the experimental section not only show that we can effectively perform DR on DMPs while learning, but we can also obtain better learning curves, as well as additional information about each motion: linear mappings relating joint values and some latent variables.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, the fixed-time stability of dynamical systems and the fixed-time synchronization of coupled discontinuous neural networks are investigated under the framework of Filippov solution.	Semantic Scholar
Firstly, by means of reduction to absurdity, a theorem of fixed-time stability is established and a high-precision estimation of the settling-time is given.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown by theoretic proof that the estimation bound of the settling time given in this paper is less conservative and more accurate compared with the classical results.	Semantic Scholar
Besides, as an important application, the fixed-time synchronization of coupled neural networks with discontinuous activation functions is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
By designing a discontinuous control law and using the theory of differential inclusions, some new criteria are derived to ensure the fixed-time synchronization of the addressed coupled networks.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, two numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness and validity of the theoretical results.	Semantic Scholar
The operation of mobile robots in unknown environments typically requires building maps during exploration.	Semantic Scholar
As the exploration time and environment size increase, the amount of data collected and the number of variables required to represent these maps both grow, which is problematic since all real robots have finite resources.	Semantic Scholar
The solution proposed in this paper is to only retain the variables and measurements that are most important to achieve the robot's task.	Semantic Scholar
The variable and measurement selection approach is demonstrated on the task of navigation with a low risk of collision.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach has two stages: first, a subset of the variables is selected that is most useful for minimizing the uncertainty of navigation (termed the “focused variables”).	Semantic Scholar
And second, a task-agnostic method is used to select a subset of the measurements that maximizes the information over these focused variables (“focused inference”).	Semantic Scholar
Detailed simulations and hardware experiments show that the two-stage approach constrains the number of variables and measurements.	Semantic Scholar
It can generate much sparser maps than existing approaches in the literature, while still achieving a better task performance—in this case (fewer collisions).	Semantic Scholar
An incremental and iterative approach is further presented, in which the two-stage procedure is performed on subsets of the data, and thus, avoids the necessity of performing a resource-intensive batch selection on large datasets.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a framework for task allocation in human-robot collaborative assembly planning.	Semantic Scholar
Our framework distinguishes between two main layers of abstraction and allocation.	Semantic Scholar
In the higher layer, we use an abstract world model, incorporating a multiagent human-robot team approach in order to describe the collaborative assembly planning problem.	Semantic Scholar
From this, nominal co-ordinated skill sequences for every agent are produced.	Semantic Scholar
In order to be able to treat humans and robots as agents of the same form, we move relevant differences/peculiarities into distinct cost functions.	Semantic Scholar
The layer beneath handles the concrete skill execution.	Semantic Scholar
On atomic level, skills are composed of complex hierarchical and concurrent hybrid state machines, which in turn co-ordinate the real-time behavior of the robot.	Semantic Scholar
Their careful design allows to cope with unpredictable events also on decisional level without having to explicitly plan for them, instead one may rely also on manually designed skills.	Semantic Scholar
Such events are likely to happen in dynamic and potentially partially known environments, which is especially true in case of human presence.	Semantic Scholar
Product reviews are valuable for upcoming buyers in helping them make decisions.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, different opinion mining techniques have been proposed, where judging a review sentence's orientation (e.g., positive or negative) is one of their key challenges.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, deep learning has emerged as an effective means for solving sentiment classification problems.	Semantic Scholar
A neural network intrinsically learns a useful representation automatically without human efforts.	Semantic Scholar
However, the success of deep learning highly relies on the availability of large-scale training data.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel deep learning framework for product review sentiment classification which employs prevalently available ratings as weak supervision signals.	Semantic Scholar
The framework consists of two steps: (1) learning a high level representation (an embedding space) which captures the general sentiment distribution of sentences through rating information; and (2) adding a classification layer on top of the embedding layer and use labeled sentences for supervised fine-tuning.	Semantic Scholar
We explore two kinds of low level network structure for modeling review sentences, namely, convolutional feature extractors and long short-term memory.	Semantic Scholar
To evaluate the proposed framework, we construct a dataset containing 1.1M weakly labeled review sentences and 11,754 labeled review sentences from Amazon.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed framework and its superiority over baselines.	Semantic Scholar
It is known that in the creation of isotropic magnetic manipulation systems using a set of stationary electromagnets, eight electromagnets are necessary to ensure that there are no singularities in the workspace.	Semantic Scholar
A variety of eight-electromagnet configurations have been proposed to date.	Semantic Scholar
In the first contribution of this letter, we conduct a critical comparison of these proposed configurations, and find that certain configurations are superior in terms of field and torque generation, whereas others are superior in terms of force generation due to the spatial derivative of the field.	Semantic Scholar
All of the prior configurations comprise a high degree of symmetry, yet access to the workspace varies widely between designs.	Semantic Scholar
In the second contribution of this letter, we propose a new configuration that does not comprise the symmetry seen in prior systems, and also provides more open access to the manipulation workspace than prior systems, yet still exhibits an isotropic workspace with comparable performance to prior systems.	Semantic Scholar
We conclude that designers of isotropic eight-electromagnet manipulation systems should not feel obliged to incorporate symmetry into their design.	Semantic Scholar

Human training data can scaffold robot imitation learning.	Semantic Scholar
However, most datagloves only record joint angles, but for many tasks, force control is more important.	Semantic Scholar
They also cover the human skin, thereby making a natural interaction of the human with the object impossible.	Semantic Scholar
This letter suggests a wearable sensor that can measure the three-axis force vector exerted at the fingertip, without covering the skin that contacts the object.	Semantic Scholar
Using two small-sized Hall effect based three-axis sensors mounted on the sides of the fingertips, the finger pad deformation resulting from the force vector acting on the fingertip is measured.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments with ten subjects show that the force vectors can be measured with reasonable precision.	Semantic Scholar
"Furthermore, the influence of the Earth's magnetic field and the finger's orientation on the finger tactile sensor's measurement has been reduced from <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\pm 4N$</tex-math></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\pm 1N$ </tex-math></inline-formula>."	Semantic Scholar
Understanding how images of objects and scenes behave in response to specific egomotions is a crucial aspect of proper visual development, yet existing visual learning methods are conspicuously disconnected from the physical source of their images.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a new “embodied” visual learning paradigm, exploiting proprioceptive motor signals to train visual representations from egocentric video with no manual supervision.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we enforce that our learned features exhibit equivariance i.e., they respond predictably to transformations associated with distinct egomotions.	Semantic Scholar
With three datasets, we show that our unsupervised feature learning approach significantly outperforms previous approaches on visual recognition and next-best-view prediction tasks.	Semantic Scholar
In the most challenging test, we show that features learned from video captured on an autonomous driving platform improve large-scale scene recognition in static images from a disjoint domain.	Semantic Scholar
Series-elastic actuators are quickly becoming the core component of robots operating in real-world environments, allowing for robust, safe, torque-controlled robots.	Semantic Scholar
This letter investigates the influence of the selected stiffness and control parameters.	Semantic Scholar
By consolidating several analyses, it is shown two opposing criteria exist for the choice of stiffness: lowering stiffness increases actuator transparency, while increasing stiffness increases torque tracking bandwidth.	Semantic Scholar
This fact is used in the context of impedance rendering to propose an optimal stiffness selection criterion that maximizes the renderable impedance frequency.	Semantic Scholar
This provides a concrete method for choosing stiffness based on the application of the joint.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive simulation and experimental results are presented that validate the analyses.	Semantic Scholar
Impulsive actuation enables robots to perform agile maneuvers and surpass difficult terrain, yet its capacity to induce continuous and stable locomotion have not been explored.	Semantic Scholar
We claim that strictly convex foot shapes can improve the impulse effectiveness (impulse used per travelled distance) and locomotion speed by facilitating periodicity and stability.	Semantic Scholar
To test this premise, we introduce a theoretical 2-D model based on rigid-body mechanics to prove stability.	Semantic Scholar
We then implement a more elaborate model in simulation to study transient behavior and impulse effectiveness.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we test our findings on a robot platform to prove their physical validity.	Semantic Scholar
Our results prove that continuous and stable locomotion can be achieved in the strictly convex case of a disk with an off-centered mass.	Semantic Scholar
In keeping with our theory, stable limit cycles of the off-centered disk outperform the theoretical performance of a cube in simulation and experiment, using up to 10 times less impulse per distance to travel at the same locomotion speed.	Semantic Scholar
In existing neural network (NN) learning control methods, the trajectory of NN inputs must be recurrent to satisfy a stringent condition termed persistent excitation (PE) so that NN parameter convergence is obtainable.	Semantic Scholar
This paper focuses on command-filtered backstepping adaptive control for a class of strict-feedback nonlinear systems with functional uncertainties, where an NN composite learning technique is proposed to guarantee convergence of NN weights to their ideal values without the PE condition.	Semantic Scholar
In the NN composite learning, spatially localized NN approximation is employed to handle functional uncertainties, online historical data together with instantaneous data are exploited to generate prediction errors, and both tracking errors and prediction errors are employed to update NN weights.	Semantic Scholar
The influence of NN approximation errors on the control performance is also clearly shown.	Semantic Scholar
The distinctive feature of the proposed NN composite learning is that NN parameter convergence is guaranteed without the requirement of the trajectory of NN inputs being recurrent.	Semantic Scholar
Illustrative results have verified effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method compared with existing NN learning control methods.	Semantic Scholar
This letter extends the use of the velocity decomposition metric for underactuated mechanical systems to the design of an enhanced hybrid zero dynamics (HZD)-based controller for biped robots.	Semantic Scholar
The metric has been used to quantify the control authority of underactuated planar bipeds by measuring the amount of nonlinear coupling between the actuated and unactuated degrees of freedom.	Semantic Scholar
Here, an offset to the biped's desired torso angle is applied in proportion to the error in the unactuated velocity, as determined through the decomposition.	Semantic Scholar
This offset aids in rejecting both acceleration and deceleration disturbances to the unactuated velocity.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation results with a point-foot, three-link planar biped show that the velocity decomposition-enhanced controller has identical performance to transverse linearization feedback control and outperforms both the unmodified HZD-based controller and an alternative hip velocity-enhanced controller in rejecting disturbances.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results with the planar, point-foot, five-link biped ERNIE confirm these same trends.	Semantic Scholar
The velocity decomposition-enhanced controller enables return to steady-state walking in fewer steps following a disturbance and with lower average and peak torques.	Semantic Scholar
The dynamics of the inertia-wheel pendulum, when subjected to impulsive inputs, can be described by algebraic equations.	Semantic Scholar
Optimal sequences of these inputs, that minimize their infinity norm, are designed for rest-to-rest maneuvers.	Semantic Scholar
The results are applied to the well-studied swing-up problem, and high-gain feedback is used for continuous approximation of the inputs and simulation of the impulsive dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
Analytical and simulation results establish a direct link between high wheel velocities during swing-up and control strategies that take the pendulum directly to the upright configuration.	Semantic Scholar
They also indicate that optimal trajectories resemble those of energy-based controllers and can be designed to satisfy the torque constraint of the actuator.	Semantic Scholar
Fault-tolerance techniques for stream processing engines can be categorized into passive and active approaches.	Semantic Scholar
However, both approaches have their own inadequacies in Massively Parallel Stream Processing Engines (MPSPE).	Semantic Scholar
The passive approach incurs a long recovery latency especially when a number of correlated nodes fail simultaneously, while the active approach requires extra replication resources.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a new fault-tolerance framework, which is Passive and Partially Active (PPA).	Semantic Scholar
In a PPA scheme, the passive approach is applied to all tasks while only a selected set of tasks will be actively replicated.	Semantic Scholar
The number of actively replicated tasks depends on the available resources.	Semantic Scholar
If tasks without active replicas fail, tentative outputs will be generated before the completion of the recovery process.	Semantic Scholar
We also propose effective and efficient algorithms to optimize a partially active replication plan to maximize the quality of tentative outputs.	Semantic Scholar
We implemented PPA on top of Storm, an open-source MPSPE and conducted extensive experiments using both real and synthetic datasets to verify the effectiveness of our approach.	Semantic Scholar

In this paper, we study ways to enhance the composition of teams based on new requirements in a collaborative environment.	Semantic Scholar
We focus on recommending team members who can maintain the team's performance by minimizing changes to the team's skills and social structure.	Semantic Scholar
Our recommendations are based on computing team-level similarity, which includes skill similarity, structural similarity as well as the  synergy between the two.	Semantic Scholar
Current heuristic approaches are one-dimensional and not comprehensive, as they consider the two aspects independently.	Semantic Scholar
To formalize team-level similarity, we adopt the notion of graph kernel of attributed graphs to encompass the two aspects and their interaction.	Semantic Scholar
To tackle the computational challenges, we propose a family of fast algorithms by (a) designing effective pruning strategies, and (b) exploring the smoothness between the existing and the new team structures.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive empirical evaluations on real world datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
We study the capacity of Hodgkin-Huxley neuron in a network to change temporarily or permanently their connections and behavior, the so called spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), as a function of their synchronous behavior.	Semantic Scholar
We consider STDP of excitatory and inhibitory synapses driven by Hebbian rules.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the final state of networks evolved by a STDP depend on the initial network configuration.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, an initial all-to-all topology evolves to a complex topology.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, external perturbations can induce co-existence of clusters, those whose neurons are synchronous and those whose neurons are desynchronous.	Semantic Scholar
This work reveals that STDP based on Hebbian rules leads to a change in the direction of the synapses between high and low frequency neurons, and therefore, Hebbian learning can be explained in terms of preferential attachment between these two diverse communities of neurons, those with low-frequency spiking neurons, and those with higher-frequency spiking neurons.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we propose a human movement model both for myoelectric assistive robot control and biosignal-sensor-failure detection.	Semantic Scholar
We particularly consider an application to upper extremity exoskeleton robot control.	Semantic Scholar
When using electromyography (EMG)-based assistive robot control, EMG electrodes can be easily disconnected or detached from skin surfaces because the human body is always in contact with the robot.	Semantic Scholar
If multiple electrodes are used to estimate multiple joint movements, the probability of sensor electrode misplacement increases due to human error.	Semantic Scholar
To cope with the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel human movement estimation model that takes anomalies into account as uncertain observations.	Semantic Scholar
We estimated human joint torques by automatically modulating the contribution of each sensor channel for the movement estimation based on anomaly scores that were computed according to synergistic muscular coordination.	Semantic Scholar
We compared our proposed method with conventional approaches during drinking-movement estimation with five healthy subjects in the three aforementioned anomaly situations and showed the effectiveness of our proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
We applied it to a four-DOF upper limb assistive exoskeleton robot and showed proper control in sensor failure situations.	Semantic Scholar
We present a novel method to auto-calibrate gaze estimators based on gaze patterns obtained from other viewers.	Semantic Scholar
Our method is based on the observation that the gaze patterns of humans are indicative of where a new viewer will look at.	Semantic Scholar
When a new viewer is looking at a stimulus, we first estimate a topology of gaze points (initial gaze points).	Semantic Scholar
Next, these points are transformed so that they match the gaze patterns of other humans to find the correct gaze points.	Semantic Scholar
In a flexible uncalibrated setup with a web camera and no chin rest, the proposed method is tested on ten subjects and ten images.	Semantic Scholar
The method estimates the gaze points after looking at a stimulus for a few seconds with an average error below $$4.5^{\circ }$$ 4 .	Semantic Scholar
5 ∘ .	Semantic Scholar
Although the reported performance is lower than what could be achieved with dedicated hardware or calibrated setup, the proposed method still provides sufficient accuracy to trace the viewer attention.	Semantic Scholar
This is promising considering the fact that auto-calibration is done in a flexible setup , without the use of a chin rest, and based only on a few seconds of gaze initialization data.	Semantic Scholar
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use human gaze patterns in order to auto-calibrate gaze estimators.	Semantic Scholar
Pogo-stick bouncing or the spring loaded inverted pendulum represents fundamental dynamics models for hopping and running in legged locomotion.	Semantic Scholar
However, these conceptual models are in general of lower order than the elastic multibody dynamics of versatile segmented legs.	Semantic Scholar
The question how to embody these simple models into real robot leg designs still has not been completely answered so far.	Semantic Scholar
The concept of eigenmodes for linear systems provides a tool to separate high-dimensional, coupled dynamics in one-dimensional (1-D) invariant ones.	Semantic Scholar
However, the dynamics of segmented legs is in general nonlinear such that even the existence of periodic motions, as appearing typically in locomotion tasks, cannot be generally guaranteed without changing intrinsic dynamics behavior substantially by control.	Semantic Scholar
This letter extends the concept of eigenmodes, which is well known for linear systems, to the nonlinear case.	Semantic Scholar
By proposing a method for selecting the design parameters of multibody systems such that desired eigenmodes are achieved, the problem of embodying fundamental locomotion modes into legged systems is resolved.	Semantic Scholar
Examples of practically realizable leg designs are provided, which proof the existence of invariant, 1-D oscillation modes in nonlinear, elastic robot dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
An experiment on a multilegged robotic system validates that energetic efficiency can be gained by the proposed approach.	Semantic Scholar
A mechanical system consisting of a hoop and a pole is considered, for which the corresponding dynamic model represents an underactuated system subject to second-order nonholonomic constraints.	Semantic Scholar
The pursued goal is to simultaneously track a trajectory in the unactuated coordinates and to stabilize the actuated ones.	Semantic Scholar
For the model under consideration, the well-known noncollocated partial feedback linearization algorithm fails since the corresponding zero dynamics is unstable.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we show that the actuated coordinates, i.e., the pole can be stabilized by exploiting the null space of the coupling inertia matrix without affecting the performance in the underactuated coordinates tracking.	Semantic Scholar
We present a formal mathematical analysis, which guarantees ultimate boundedness of all coordinates.	Semantic Scholar
Performed simulations bolster the proposed approach.	Semantic Scholar
Gastric adenocarcinoma is the fifth most common malignancy in the world and the third leading cause of cancer death in both women and men.	Semantic Scholar
In 2012, its estimated global incidence was 952,000 new cases with an estimated 723,000 deaths worldwide [1]-[3].	Semantic Scholar
It is projected to rise from 14th to eighth in all-cause mortality in the near term, primarily due to the growing and aging populations in high-incidence areas, such as Latin America and eastern Asia [4], [5].	Semantic Scholar
Unlike any other major cancer, gastric cancer demonstrates marked geographic variability in regions and within countries, with more than 70% of incident cases concentrated in lowand middle-income countries (LMICs) [1], [2].	Semantic Scholar
Online reviews have become an important source of information for users before making an informed purchase decision.	Semantic Scholar
Early reviews of a product tend to have a high impact on the subsequent product sales.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we take the initiative to study the behavior characteristics of early reviewers through their posted reviews on two real-world large e-commerce platforms, i.e., Amazon and Yelp.	Semantic Scholar
In specific, we divide product lifetime into three consecutive stages, namely early, majority, and laggards.	Semantic Scholar
A user who has posted a review in the early stage is considered as an early reviewer.	Semantic Scholar
We quantitatively characterize early reviewers based on their rating behaviors, the helpfulness scores received from others and the correlation of their reviews with product popularity.	Semantic Scholar
We have found that (1) an early reviewer tends to assign a higher average rating score; and (2) an early reviewer tends to post more helpful reviews.	Semantic Scholar
Our analysis of product reviews also indicates that early reviewers’ ratings and their received helpfulness scores are likely to influence product popularity.	Semantic Scholar
By viewing the review posting process as a multiplayer competition game, we propose a novel margin-based embedding model for early reviewer prediction.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on two different e-commerce datasets have shown that our proposed approach outperforms a number of competitive baselines.	Semantic Scholar
While Shannon's mutual information has widespread applications in many disciplines, for practical applications it is often difficult to calculate its value accurately for high-dimensional variables because of the curse of dimensionality.	Semantic Scholar
This article focuses on effective approximation methods for evaluating mutual information in the context of neural population coding.	Semantic Scholar
For large but finite neural populations, we derive several information-theoretic asymptotic bounds and approximation formulas that remain valid in high-dimensional spaces.	Semantic Scholar
We prove that optimizing the population density distribution based on these approximation formulas is a convex optimization problem that allows efficient numerical solutions.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical simulation results confirmed that our asymptotic formulas were highly accurate for approximating mutual information for large neural populations.	Semantic Scholar
In special cases, the approximation formulas are exactly equal to the true mutual information.	Semantic Scholar
We also discuss techniques of variable transformation and dimensionality reduction to facilitate computation of the approximations.	Semantic Scholar

Semantic Scholar
Even for networks of modest size, it is often difficult to evaluate all pairwise possibilities for links in a meaningful way.	Semantic Scholar
Further, even though link prediction is closely related to missing value estimation problems, it is often difficult to use sophisticated models such as latent factor methods because of their computational complexity on large networks.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, most known link prediction methods are designed for <italic>evaluating</italic> the link propensity on a <italic>specified</italic> subset of links, rather than on the entire networks.	Semantic Scholar
In practice, however, it is essential to perform an exhaustive search over the entire networks.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we propose an ensemble enabled approach to scaling up link prediction, by decomposing traditional link prediction problems into subproblems of smaller size.	Semantic Scholar
These subproblems are each solved with latent factor models, which can be effectively implemented on networks of modest size.	Semantic Scholar
By incorporating with the characteristics of link prediction, the ensemble approach further reduces the sizes of subproblems without sacrificing its prediction accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
The ensemble enabled approach has several advantages in terms of performance, and our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach.	Semantic Scholar
The assumption of scene rigidity is typical in SLAM algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Such a strong assumption limits the use of most visual SLAM systems in populated real-world environments, which are the target of several relevant applications like service robotics or autonomous vehicles.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter we present DynaSLAM, a visual SLAM system that, building on ORB-SLAM2, adds the capabilities of dynamic object detection and background inpainting.	Semantic Scholar
DynaSLAM is robust in dynamic scenarios for monocular, stereo, and RGB-D configurations.	Semantic Scholar
We are capable of detecting the moving objects either by multiview geometry, deep learning, or both.	Semantic Scholar
Having a static map of the scene allows inpainting the frame background that has been occluded by such dynamic objects.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our system in public monocular, stereo, and RGB-D datasets.	Semantic Scholar
We study the impact of several accuracy/speed trade-offs to assess the limits of the proposed methodology.	Semantic Scholar
DynaSLAM outperforms the accuracy of standard visual SLAM baselines in highly dynamic scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
And it also estimates a map of the static parts of the scene, which is a must for long-term applications in real-world environments.	Semantic Scholar
The aim of the present study was to understand whether modeling brain function in terms of network structure makes it possible to find markers of prediction of motor learning performance in a sensory motor learning task.	Semantic Scholar
By applying graph theory indexes of brain segregation - such as modularity and transitivity - to functional connectivity data derived from electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms, we further studied pre- (baseline) versus post-task brain network architecture to understand whether motor learning induces changes in functional brain connectivity.	Semantic Scholar
The results showed that, after the training session with measurable learning, transitivity increased in the alpha1 EEG frequency band and modularity increased in the theta band and decreased in the gamma band, suggesting that brain segregation is modulated by the cognitive task.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, it was observed that theta modularity at the baseline negatively correlated with the performance improvement; namely, the lower this connectivity index at the baseline pre-task period, the higher the improvement of performance with training.	Semantic Scholar
The present results show that brain segregation is modulated by the cognitive task and that it is possible to predict performance by the study of pre-task EEG rhythm connectivity parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Future production systems must meet the continual demands for improved productivity and energy efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
Being flexible and adaptable, reconfigurable systems offer great opportunities to face these challenges.	Semantic Scholar
Against this background, this letter is concerned with the reconfiguration planning of Delta-like parallel robots.	Semantic Scholar
Following the trend of equipping the original Delta robot with additional rotational dof, a potential analysis reveals a great variety of dimensional and functional reconfiguration possibilities.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this, the reconfiguration planning is optimized applying operations research techniques.	Semantic Scholar
In this approach, a fixed number of configurations is optimally selected from the entire configuration space and simultaneously allocated to a set of handling tasks in a most energy efficient way.	Semantic Scholar
Each allocation's energy consumption is efficiently computed using Kane's inverse dynamics formulation.	Semantic Scholar
The outcome of a case study demonstrates the general applicability and energy-saving potential of the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
A large amount of heterogeneous event data are increasingly generated, e.g., in online systems for Web services or operational systems in enterprises.	Semantic Scholar
Owing to the difference between event data and traditional relational data, the matching of heterogeneous events is highly non-trivial.	Semantic Scholar
While event names are often opaque (e.g., merely with obscure IDs), the existing structure-based matching techniques for relational data also fail to perform owing to the poor discriminative power of dependency relationships between events.	Semantic Scholar
We note that interesting patterns exist in the occurrence of events, which may serve as discriminative features in event matching.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we formalize the problem of matching events with patterns.	Semantic Scholar
A generic pattern based matching framework is proposed, which is compatible with the existing structure based techniques.	Semantic Scholar
To improve the matching efficiency, we devise several bounds of matching scores for pruning.	Semantic Scholar
Recognizing the np-hardness of the optimal event matching problem with patterns, we propose efficient heuristic.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our pattern based matching compared with approaches adapted from existing techniques, and the efficiency improved by the bounding, pruning and heuristic methods.	Semantic Scholar
In recent years, significant emphases and efforts have been placed on developing and implementing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).	Semantic Scholar
These systems need to work with human drivers to increase vehicle occupant safety, control, and performance in both ordinary and emergency driving situations.	Semantic Scholar
To aid such cooperation between human drivers and ADAS, driver models are necessary to replicate and predict human driving behaviors and distinguish among different drivers.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a combined driver model that is able to not only identify different individual driver behaviors, but also predict a driver's behavior in rare vehicle maneuvers such as collision avoidance (CA) based on his/her daily driving data.	Semantic Scholar
The driver model consists of a compensatory transfer function and an anticipatory component and is integrated with the design of the individual driver's desired path.	Semantic Scholar
It has been shown that the proposed driver model can replicate each driver's steering wheel angle signal for a variety of highway and in-city maneuvers.	Semantic Scholar
The utility of the proposed driver model is its ability to predict a driver's steering wheel angle signal for a CA maneuver from only daily nonemergency driving data.	Semantic Scholar
The driver model is then validated by comparing two different drivers’ model parameter sets to the group average to show that each driver has a unique set of parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the driver model is validated by showing that its daily driving parameters differ from its predicted CA parameters.	Semantic Scholar

This letter presents a novel soft robotic glove system for assistive and rehabilitative applications, offering a powerful, low-profile, and convenient solution for the growing elderly and patient population.	Semantic Scholar
The low-profile soft glove worn by the user weighs below 50 g, providing cable-driven flexion and extension actuations independently for all five fingers without any rigid joint or linkage, and therefore does not require joint alignment or custom fitting.	Semantic Scholar
Novel bidirectional linear soft actuators are developed to drive each finger with enhanced payload and improved user comfort.	Semantic Scholar
The actuators are regulated by novel soft orifice valves developed to provide airflow control using soft material deformation.	Semantic Scholar
The design, modeling, and fabrication procedure of the entire soft glove system is presented in detail.	Semantic Scholar
The system comprises entirely of three-dimensional (3-D) printed and commercially available components, it is therefore repeatable by anyone with access to a consumer-grade 3-D printer.	Semantic Scholar
The fabricated components and glove system were evaluated in a series of validation experiments.	Semantic Scholar
The lightweight and compliant soft glove could achieve full-range finger motion and forces up to 40 N at the fingertip with actuation pressure as low as 60 kPa, making the system capable for most grasping and interaction tasks in healthcare, service, as well as edutainment applications.	Semantic Scholar
This study presented a prestressed soft gripper fabricated with 3-D printing technology.	Semantic Scholar
The gripper can realize a large contact area while grasping and simultaneously generate large initial opening without deflating the soft actuators.	Semantic Scholar
The soft actuator was 3-D printed as two separate parts: the soft chambers with a rigid connector and a cover to seal the chambers.	Semantic Scholar
The chamber part was stretched longitudinally and sealed by gluing the cover onto it.	Semantic Scholar
The actuator was then released, and an initial curl occurred due to the remaining prestress.	Semantic Scholar
Finite element (FE) simulations were performed to validate this concept and the designed structure.	Semantic Scholar
Actuator fabrication and experimental tests were presented, and agreements between the FE simulations and test results were achieved.	Semantic Scholar
A gripper consisting of four prestressed actuators was constructed and experimentally tested by picking-and-placing food materials in different weights and different sized containers.	Semantic Scholar
To adapt to objects of different sizes and shapes, the gripper base was designed to have two configurations and two openings.	Semantic Scholar
The results showed that the prestressed gripper could stably handle various types of food and still remain compact with a simple supporting system.	Semantic Scholar
To achieve more intelligent performance for walking-assistive devices, spontaneous motion intention of walking speed should be identified for providing a control command.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, cerebral hemoglobin information was analyzed to recognize three levels of walking speed: low, medium, and high speed.	Semantic Scholar
Thirty subjects performed walking tasks in three levels of speed, with cerebral hemoglobin information being recorded and oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyHb) mainly analyzed.	Semantic Scholar
A novel method of time–frequency–space analysis is proposed to extract features through two steps.	Semantic Scholar
First, a wavelet packet method is used to analyze the oxyHb signals in four frequency bands [(I) 0–0.03 Hz, (II) 0.03–0.06 Hz, (III) 0.06–0.09 Hz, and (IV) 0.09–0.12 Hz].	Semantic Scholar
Second, spatial features were summarized for each frequency band.	Semantic Scholar
The support vector machine method is used to identify speed levels.	Semantic Scholar
The dataset of 15 people is used to train the model, and the dataset of the other 15 people is used for validation.	Semantic Scholar
The final recognition rates of low, medium, and high speed are 93.33%, 66.67%, and 80%, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
The average recognition is up to 80%.	Semantic Scholar
The results indicate that the proposed method of time–frequency–space analysis is feasible for recognizing expected walking speed, and cerebral hemoglobin information could reflect humans’ spontaneous motion intention.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, it may provide a more intelligent control method for walking-assistive devices and promote its development in the future.	Semantic Scholar
In order to enable microaerial vehicles (MAVs) to assist in complex, unknown, unstructured environments, they must be able to navigate with guaranteed safety, even when faced with a cluttered environment they have no prior knowledge of.	Semantic Scholar
While trajectory-optimization-based local planners have been shown to perform well in these cases, prior work either does not address how to deal with local minima in the optimization problem or solves it by using an optimistic global planner.	Semantic Scholar
We present a conservative trajectory-optimization-based local planner, coupled with a local exploration strategy that selects intermediate goals.	Semantic Scholar
We perform extensive simulations to show that this system performs better than the standard approach of using an optimistic global planner and also outperforms doing a single exploration step when the local planner is stuck.	Semantic Scholar
The method is validated through experiments in a variety of highly cluttered environments including a dense forest.	Semantic Scholar
These experiments show the complete system running in real time fully onboard an MAV, mapping and replanning at 4 Hz.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a novel appearance-based approach for topological mapping based on a hierarchical decomposition of the environment.	Semantic Scholar
In our map, images with similar visual properties are grouped together in nodes, which are represented by means of an average global descriptor and an index of binary features based on a bag-of-words online approach.	Semantic Scholar
Each image is represented by means of a global descriptor and a set of local features, and this information is used in a two-level loop closure approach, where first global descriptors are employed to obtain the most likely nodes of the map and then binary image features are used to retrieve the most likely images inside these nodes.	Semantic Scholar
This hierarchical scheme enables us to reduce the search space when recognizing places, maintaining high accuracy when creating a map.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach is validated using several public datasets and compared against several state-of-the-art techniques.	Semantic Scholar
The accuracy and the sparsity of the generated maps are also discussed.	Semantic Scholar
Traditional joint-space models used to describe equations of motion for humanoid robots offer nice properties linked directly to the way these robots are built.	Semantic Scholar
However, from a computational point of view and convergence properties, these models are not the fastest when used in planning optimizations.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, inspired by Cartesian coordinates used to model molecular structures, we propose a new modeling technique for humanoid robots.	Semantic Scholar
We represent robot segments by vectors and derive equations of motion for the full body.	Semantic Scholar
Using this methodology in a complex task of multicontact posture planning with minimal joint torques, we set up optimization problems and analyze the performance.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate that compared to joint-space models that get trapped in local minima, the proposed vector-based model offers much faster computational speed and a suboptimal but unique final solution.	Semantic Scholar
The underlying principle lies in reducing the nonlinearity and exploiting the sparsity in the problem structure.	Semantic Scholar
Apart from the specific case study of posture optimization, these principles can make the proposed technique a promising candidate for many other optimization-based complex tasks in robotics.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive research in the field of Visual SLAM for the past fifteen years has yielded workable systems that found their way into various applications, such as robotics and augmented reality.	Semantic Scholar
Although filter-based (e.g., Kalman Filter, Particle Filter) Visual SLAM systems were common at some time, non-filter based (i.e., akin to SfM solutions), which are more efficient, are becoming the de facto methodology for building a Visual SLAM system.	Semantic Scholar

This letter presents an index finger of human-like robotics hand which intends to closely replicate the human finger in terms of bones, ligaments, muscles, extensor mechanism, tendon, and its pulley system.	Semantic Scholar
We fabricated the muscles of the index finger using thin multifilament McKibben muscles that consist of three intrinsic and three extrinsic muscles with diameters of 1.3 mm and 4.0 mm, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
We present the fabrication method of the index finger and model it based on the Landsmeer Model I, II, and III.	Semantic Scholar
We validated the properties of our developed finger with the Landsmeer model for extension and flexion motion.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we demonstrated the capabilities of the finger using motion capture, Tracker, to compare sweeps of the HR-hand finger with a cadaver finger motion for normal and finger deformity condition.	Semantic Scholar
Having McKibben muscles as the actuator that mimics the human muscle, one can better understand the human finger function and may use it for training and for modeling the human finger disorders.	Semantic Scholar
We present a neuromorphic current mode implementation of a spiking neural classifier with lumped square law dendritic nonlinearity.	Semantic Scholar
It has been shown previously in software simulations that such a system with binary synapses can be trained with structural plasticity algorithms to achieve comparable classification accuracy with fewer synaptic resources than conventional algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
We show that even in real analog systems with manufacturing imperfections (CV of 23.5% and 14.4% for dendritic branch gains and leaks respectively), this network is able to produce comparable results with fewer synaptic resources.	Semantic Scholar
The chip fabricated in m complementary metal oxide semiconductor has eight dendrites per cell and uses two opposing cells per class to cancel common-mode inputs.	Semantic Scholar
The chip can operate down to a V and dissipates 19 nW of static power per neuronal cell and 125 pJ/spike.	Semantic Scholar
For two-class classification problems of high-dimensional rate encoded binary patterns, the hardware achieves comparable performance as software implementation of the same with only about a 0.5% reduction in accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
On two UCI data sets, the IC integrated circuit has classification accuracy comparable to standard machine learners like support vector machines and extreme learning machines while using two to five times binary synapses.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that the system can operate on mean rate encoded spike patterns, as well as short bursts of spikes.	Semantic Scholar
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in hardware to perform classification exploiting dendritic properties and binary synapses.	Semantic Scholar
Dimensionality reduction is an essential pre-processing technique in many of the data analysis tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Popular approaches for dimensionality reduction are Feature Selection (FS) and Feature Extraction (FE).	Semantic Scholar
Till now, these approaches are often studied separately or independently so that the final result contains either original or transformed features.	Semantic Scholar
In our work, we propose to bridge these two approaches with the aim of finding reduced feature set to contain both kinds (original as well as transformed) of features.	Semantic Scholar
A new framework, called Minimum Projection error Minimum Redundancy (MPeMR), is introduced to obtain this result while maintaining orthogonality property among selected original and linear combinations of features.	Semantic Scholar
A unified iterative algorithm, for both supervised and unsupervised cases, is also developed under this framework.	Semantic Scholar
For each case, the performance of the proposed algorithm is successfully compared with the state-of-the-art methods on real-life data sets.	Semantic Scholar
Recognition and detection of interactive actions performed by multiple persons have a wide range of real-world applications.	Semantic Scholar
Existing studies on the human activity analysis focus mainly on classifying video clips of simple actions performed by a single person, whereas the problem of understanding complex human activities with causal relationships between two people has not been sufficiently addressed yet.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we employ systematically organized skeleton features enhanced with directional features, and utilize sparse-group lasso to automatically choose discriminative factors that help in dealing with interactive action recognition and real-time detection tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on two person interaction datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach to the state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
In recent years, synthetic fiber ropes have attracted much attention because of their potential to increase the load capacity, reduce the size, and lighten the weight of tendon-driven mechanisms.	Semantic Scholar
However, the mechanical characteristics of synthetic fiber ropes in a dynamic loading situation remain an open problem because of their visco-elasto-plasticity.	Semantic Scholar
This letter focuses on modeling synthetic fiber ropes, and the frequency response of a long-distance cable–pulley system for a tendon-driven robot.	Semantic Scholar
We show that a synthetic fiber rope can be modeled by Flory's model, and that it can be reduced to a conventional four-element model with sufficient preloading.	Semantic Scholar
After empirically acquiring the parameters of the four-element model for four different synthetic fiber ropes, each frequency response of a long-distance cable–pulley servo system was measured and compared to the analytical results based on the model, as well as the results of a stainless wire rope.	Semantic Scholar
Consequently, we show that synthetic fiber ropes achieved comparable bandwidth to that of the stainless wire rope.	Semantic Scholar
The damping of synthetic fiber ropes was found to suppress the servo system gain.	Semantic Scholar
This is useful for joint control of a tendon-driven robot with a relatively large amount of inertia, such as a long-reach robot arm.	Semantic Scholar
Tactile sensing is required for human-like control with robotic manipulators.	Semantic Scholar
Multimodality is an essential component for these tactile sensors, for robots to achieve both the perceptual accuracy required for precise control, as well as the robustness to maintain a stable grasp without causing damage to the object or the robot itself.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we present a cheap, 3D-printed, compliant, dual-modal, optical tactile sensor that is capable of both high (temporal) speed sensing, analogous to pain reception in humans and high (spatial) resolution sensing, analogous to the sensing provided by Merkel cell complexes in the human fingertip.	Semantic Scholar
We apply three tasks for testing the sensing capabilities in both modes; first, a depth modulation task, requiring the robot to follow a target trajectory using the high-speed mode; second, a high-resolution perception task, where the sensor perceives angle and radial position relative to an object edge; and third, a tactile exploration task, where the robot uses the high-resolution mode to perceive an edge and subsequently follow the object contour.	Semantic Scholar
The robot is capable of modulating contact depth using the high-speed mode, high accuracy in the perception task, and accurate control using the high-resolution mode.	Semantic Scholar
With the rapid growth of Internet applications, sequential prediction in collaborative filtering has become an emerging and crucial task.	Semantic Scholar
Given the behavioral history of a specific user, predicting his or her next choice plays a key role in improving various online services.	Semantic Scholar
Meanwhile, there are more and more scenarios with multiple types of behaviors, while existing works mainly study sequences with a single type of behavior.	Semantic Scholar
As a widely used approach, Markov chain based models are based on a strong independence assumption.	Semantic Scholar
As two classical neural network methods for modeling sequences, recurrent neural networks cannot well model short-term contexts, and the log-bilinear model is not suitable for long-term contexts.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a Recurrent Log-BiLinear (RLBL) model.	Semantic Scholar
It can model multiple types of behaviors in historical sequences with behavior-specific transition matrices.	Semantic Scholar
RLBL applies a recurrent structure for modeling long-term contexts.	Semantic Scholar
It models several items in each hidden layer and employs position-specific transition matrices for modeling short-term contexts.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, considering continuous time difference in behavioral history is a key factor for dynamic prediction, we further extend RLBL and replace position-specific transition matrices with time-specific transition matrices, and accordingly propose a Time-Aware Recurrent Log-BiLinear (TA-RLBL) model.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that the proposed RLBL model and TA-RLBL model yield significant improvements over the competitive compared methods on three datasets, i.e., Movielens-1M dataset, Global Terrorism Database and Tmall dataset with different numbers of behavior types.	Semantic Scholar

Manually re-drawing an image in a certain artistic style takes a professional artist a long time.	Semantic Scholar
Doing this for a video sequence single-handedly is beyond imagination.	Semantic Scholar
We present two computational approaches that transfer the style from one image (for example, a painting) to a whole video sequence.	Semantic Scholar
In our first approach, we adapt to videos the original image style transfer technique by Gatys et al.	Semantic Scholar
based on energy minimization.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce new ways of initialization and new loss functions to generate consistent and stable stylized video sequences even in cases with large motion and strong occlusion.	Semantic Scholar
Our second approach formulates video stylization as a learning problem.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a deep network architecture and training procedures that allow us to stylize arbitrary-length videos in a consistent and stable way, and nearly in real time.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the proposed methods clearly outperform simpler baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we propose a way to adapt these approaches also to 360$$^\circ $$ ∘ images and videos as they emerge with recent virtual reality hardware.	Semantic Scholar
The objective of this work is to reconstruct the 3D surfaces of sculptures from one or more images using a view-dependent representation.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we train a network, SiDeNet, to predict the Silhouette and Depth of the surface given a variable number of images; the silhouette is predicted at a different viewpoint from the inputs (e.g.	Semantic Scholar
from the side), while the depth is predicted at the viewpoint of the input images.	Semantic Scholar
This has three benefits.	Semantic Scholar
First, the network learns a representation of shape beyond that of a single viewpoint, as the silhouette forces it to respect the visual hull, and the depth image forces it to predict concavities (which don’t appear on the visual hull).	Semantic Scholar
Second, as the network learns about 3D using the proxy tasks of predicting depth and silhouette images, it is not limited by the resolution of the 3D representation.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, using a view-dependent representation (e.g.	Semantic Scholar
additionally encoding the viewpoint with the input image) improves the network’s generalisability to unseen objects.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, the network is able to handle the input views in a flexible manner.	Semantic Scholar
First, it can ingest a different number of views during training and testing, and it is shown that the reconstruction performance improves as additional views are added at test-time.	Semantic Scholar
Second, the additional views do not need to be photometrically consistent.	Semantic Scholar
The network is trained and evaluated on two synthetic datasets—a realistic sculpture dataset (SketchFab), and ShapeNet.	Semantic Scholar
The design of the network is validated by comparing to state of the art methods for a set of tasks.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown that (i) passing the input viewpoint (i.e.	Semantic Scholar
using a view-dependent representation) improves the network’s generalisability at test time.	Semantic Scholar
(ii) Predicting depth/silhouette images allows for higher quality predictions in 2D, as the network is not limited by the chosen latent 3D representation.	Semantic Scholar
(iii) On both datasets the method of combining views in a global manner performs better than a local method.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we show that the trained network generalizes to real images, and probe how the network has encoded the latent 3D shape.	Semantic Scholar
Feature selection plays a significant role in dealing with high-dimensional data to avoid the curse of dimensionality.	Semantic Scholar
In many real applications, like video semantic recognition, handling few labeled and large unlabeled data samples from the same population is a recently addressed challenge in feature selection.	Semantic Scholar
To solve this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised feature selection method via insensitive sparse regression (ISR).	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we compute the soft label matrix by the special label propagation, which can predict the labels of the unlabeled data.	Semantic Scholar
"To guarantee the robustness of ISR to the false labeled instances or outliers, we propose Insensitive Regression Model (IRM) by capped <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$l_2$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""hou-ieq1-2810286.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula>-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$l_p$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""hou-ieq2-2810286.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula>-norm loss."

The soft label is imposed as the weights of IRM to fully utilize the label information.	Semantic Scholar

Moreover, we put forward an effective approach for solving the formulated non-convex optimization problem.	Semantic Scholar
We analyze the performance of convergence rigorously and discuss the parameter determination problem.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experimental results on several public data sets verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in comparison with the state-of-art feature selection methods.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we apply our method to video semantic recognition successfully.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a physically based algorithm to interactively simulate and control the motion of soft robots interacting with their environment.	Semantic Scholar
We use the finite-element method to simulate the nonlinear deformation of the soft structure, its actuators, and surroundings and propose a control method relying on a quadratic optimization to find the inverse of the model.	Semantic Scholar
The novelty of this work is that the deformations due to contacts, including self-collisions, are taken into account in the optimization process.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a dedicated and efficient solver to handle the linear complementarity constraints introduced by the contacts.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, the method allows interactive transfer of the motion of soft robots from their task space to their actuator space while interacting with their surrounding.	Semantic Scholar
The method is generic and tested on several numerical examples and on a real cable-driven soft robot.	Semantic Scholar
The supercoiled polymer (SCP) actuator is a recently discovered artificial muscle that demonstrates significant mechanical power, large contraction, and good dynamic range in a muscle-like form factor.	Semantic Scholar
There has been a rapid increase of research efforts devoted to the study of SCP actuators.	Semantic Scholar
For robotics, SCP actuators overcome specific challenges of artificial muscles such as shape memory alloy wires, where limited strain and slow dynamics, and power consumption had limited their use.	Semantic Scholar
It is known that hysteresis nonlinearity results from coiling the threads, and can cause up to 30% strain difference under the same voltage; however, no work has been reported to characterize the hysteresis in SCP actuators.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, three new models are formulated to characterize the hysteretic relationship between three coupled variables (voltage input, strain, and load) of an SCP actuator, namely, the augmented generalized Prandtl–Ishlinskii model, the augmented Preisach model, and the augmented linear model.	Semantic Scholar
By incorporating the relationship between hysteresis curves and loading forces, the proposed models can efficiently characterize the hysteresis.	Semantic Scholar
Open-loop position control is further realized through inverse compensation.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that the proposed schemes can effectively estimate and compensate the hysteresis.	Semantic Scholar
For the first time, the hysteresis characterization and compensation of SCP actuators are successfully demonstrated, such that accurate robot control can be realized.	Semantic Scholar
This paper focuses on stability analysis for neural networks systems with time-varying delays.	Semantic Scholar
A more general auxiliary function-based integral inequality is established and some improved delay-dependent stability conditions formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are derived by employing a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) and the novel integral inequality.

Three well-known application examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and improvements of the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
Redundant navigation systems are critical for safe operation of UAVs in high-risk environments.	Semantic Scholar
Since most commercial UAVs almost wholly rely on GPS, jamming, interference, and multi-pathing are real concerns that usually limit their operations to low-risk environments and visual line-of-sight.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a vision-based route-following system for the autonomous, safe return of UAVs under primary navigation failure such as GPS jamming.	Semantic Scholar
Using a Visual Teach and Repeat framework to build a visual map of the environment during an outbound flight, we show the autonomous return of the UAV by visually localizing the live view to this map when a simulated GPS failure occurs, controlling the vehicle to follow the safe outbound path back to the launch point.	Semantic Scholar
Using gimbal-stabilized stereo vision and inertial sensing alone, without reliance on external infrastructure, Visual Odometry and localization are achieved at altitudes of 5–25 m and flight speeds up to 55 km/h.	Semantic Scholar
We examine the performance of the visual localization algorithm under a variety of conditions and also demonstrate closed-loop autonomy along a complicated 450 m path.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents an in-depth analysis of the convex properties of center-of-mass (CoM) trajectories for legged robot locomotion based on the concept of Divergent Component of Motion (DCM).	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we show that the union of all possible trajectories forms a bounded convex set under appropriate boundary conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, we describe in detail our approach of generating closed-form CoM trajectories through piecewise interpolation over a sequence of waypoints and show how to compute the CoM trajectory efficiently through equations given in a matrix form.	Semantic Scholar
Applying the convex properties to our trajectory-generation approach, we present an algorithm for computing convex overapproximations of the CoM waypoints.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we provide an example of usage in placing waypoints that lead to feasible CoM trajectories with respect to kinematic and dynamic constraints.	Semantic Scholar
The approach is validated with a multi-contact scenario in simulation with the humanoid robot TORO.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we present a theoretical analysis to understand sparse filtering, a recent and effective algorithm for unsupervised learning.	Semantic Scholar
The aim of this research is not to show whether or how well sparse filtering works, but to understand why and when sparse filtering does work.	Semantic Scholar
We provide a thorough theoretical analysis of sparse filtering and its properties, and further offer an experimental validation of the main outcomes of our theoretical analysis.	Semantic Scholar
We show that sparse filtering works by explicitly maximizing the entropy of the learned representations through the maximization of the proxy of sparsity, and by implicitly preserving mutual information between original and learned representations through the constraint of preserving a structure of the data.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we show that the sparse filtering algorithm implemented using an absolute-value non-linearity determines the preservation of a data structure defined by relations of neighborhoodness under the cosine distance.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we empirically validate our theoretical results with artificial and real data sets, and we apply our theoretical understanding to explain the success of sparse filtering on real-world problems.	Semantic Scholar
Our work provides a strong theoretical basis for understanding sparse filtering: it highlights assumptions and conditions for success behind this feature distribution learning algorithm, and provides insights for developing new feature distribution learning algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Robotic rehabilitation of the hands from a neuromuscular impairment such as stroke requires controllers that could provide subject-specific assistance and result in fastest possible recovery.	Semantic Scholar
We present two such assist-as-needed controllers for a hand exoskeleton called Maestro that is designed to provide accurate torque assistance to a subject.	Semantic Scholar
Learned force-field control is a novel control technique in which a neural-network-based model of the required torques is learned offline for a specific subject and then used to render a force-field to assist the finger motion to follow a target trajectory.	Semantic Scholar
Adaptive assist-as-needed control, on the other hand, estimates the coupled finger-exoskeleton system torque requirement of a subject using a radial basis function (RBF) network and adapts the RBF magnitudes in real-time to provide a feedforward assistance for accurate trajectory tracking.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments with a healthy subject on Maestro showed that while the force-field control is nonadaptive and there is less control on the speed of execution of the task, it is safer as it does not apply increased torques if the finger motion is restricted.	Semantic Scholar
On the other hand, adaptive assist-as-needed controller adapts to the changing needs of the coupled finger-exoskeleton system and helps in performing the task with a consistent speed, however, applies increased torques in case of restricted motion and is therefore, potentially less safe.	Semantic Scholar
Pedestrian behavior is an omnipresent topic, but the underlying cognitive processes and the various influences on movement behavior are still not fully understood.	Semantic Scholar
Nonetheless, computational simulations that predict crowd behavior are essential for safety, economics, and transport.	Semantic Scholar
Contemporary approaches of pedestrian behavior modeling focus strongly on the movement aspects and seldom address the rich body of research from cognitive science.	Semantic Scholar
Similarly, general purpose cognitive architectures are not suitable for agents that can move in spatial domains because they do not consider the profound findings of pedestrian dynamics research.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, multi-agent simulations of crowd behavior that strongly incorporate both research domains have not yet been fully realized.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we propose the cognitive agent framework Spice.	Semantic Scholar
The framework provides an approach to structure pedestrian agent models by integrating concepts of pedestrian dynamics and cognition.	Semantic Scholar
Further, we provide a model that implements the framework.	Semantic Scholar
The model solves spatial sequential choice problems in sufficient detail, including movement and cognition aspects.	Semantic Scholar
We apply the model in a computer simulation and validate the Spice approach by means of data from an uncontrolled field study.	Semantic Scholar
The Spice framework is an important starting point for further research, as we believe that fostering interdisciplinary modeling approaches will be highly beneficial to the field of pedestrian dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a trajectory optimization framework for whole-body motion planning through contacts.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate how the proposed approach can be applied to automatically discover different gaits and dynamic motions on a quadruped robot.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to most previous methods, we do not prespecify contact-switches, -timings, -points or gait patterns, but they are a direct outcome of the optimization.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we optimize over the entire dynamics of the robot, which enables the optimizer to fully leverage the capabilities of the robot.	Semantic Scholar
To illustrate the spectrum of achievable motions, we show eight different tasks, which would require very different control structures when solved with state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
Using our trajectory optimization approach, we are solving each task with a simple, high level cost function and without any changes in the control structure.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we fully integrate our approach with the robot's control and estimation framework such that we are able to run the optimization online.	Semantic Scholar
Through several hardware experiments, we show that the optimized trajectories and control inputs can be directly applied to physical systems.	Semantic Scholar
This letter considers the problem of reducing uncertainty about a physical process of interest by designing sensing trajectories for a team of robots.	Semantic Scholar
This active information gathering problem has applications in environmental monitoring, search and rescue, and security and surveillance.	Semantic Scholar
Our previous work developed a search-based planning method for information gathering which prunes uninformative trajectories from the search space while providing suboptimality guarantees and decentralizes the planning across multiple robots via coordinate descent.	Semantic Scholar
The novelty of this letter is to demonstrate the practical feasibility of these algorithms in a target tracking scenario featuring three collaborating UAVs and five mobile targets.	Semantic Scholar
To achieve this, we relax the previous requirement of having centralized estimation by performing distributed information filtering.	Semantic Scholar
We then develop an anytime planning algorithm that progressively reduces the suboptimality of the information gathering plans while respecting real-time constraints.	Semantic Scholar
These contributions enable robust and scalable information gathering using a team of agile robots that adapt their cooperation to timing constraints and ad hoc communication without the need for external or centralized computation.	Semantic Scholar
Location prediction is widely used to forecast users’ next place to visit based on his/her mobility logs.	Semantic Scholar
It is an essential problem in location data processing, invaluable for surveillance, business, and personal applications.	Semantic Scholar
It is very challenging due to the sparsity issues of check-in data.	Semantic Scholar
An often ignored problem in recent studies is the variety across different check-in scenarios, which is becoming more urgent due to the increasing availability of more location check-in applications.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a new feature fusion based prediction approach, GALLOP, i.e., GlobAL feature fused LOcation Prediction for different check-in scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the carefully designed feature extraction methods, we utilize a novel combined prediction framework.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we set out to utilize the density estimation model to profile geographical features, i.e., context information, the factorization method to extract collaborative information, and a graph structure to extract location transition patterns of users’ temporal check-in sequence, i.e., content information.	Semantic Scholar
An empirical study on three different check-in datasets demonstrates impressive robustness and improvement of the proposed approach.	Semantic Scholar

Inspired by such intricate natural phenomena, Evolved Plastic Artificial Neural Networks (EPANNs) employ simulated evolution in-silico to breed plastic neural networks with the aim to autonomously design and create learning systems.	Semantic Scholar
EPANN experiments evolve networks that include both innate properties and the ability to change and learn in response to experiences in different environments and problem domains.	Semantic Scholar
EPANNs' aims include autonomously creating learning systems, bootstrapping learning from scratch, recovering performance in unseen conditions, testing the computational advantages of particular neural components, and deriving hypotheses on the emergence of biological learning.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, EPANNs may include a large variety of different neuron types and dynamics, network architectures, plasticity rules, and other factors.	Semantic Scholar
While EPANNs have seen considerable progress over the last two decades, current scientific and technological advances in artificial neural networks are setting the conditions for radically new approaches and results.	Semantic Scholar
Exploiting the increased availability of computational resources and of simulation environments, the often challenging task of hand-designing learning neural networks could be replaced by more autonomous and creative processes.	Semantic Scholar
This paper brings together a variety of inspiring ideas that define the field of EPANNs.	Semantic Scholar

To lower the need for hand labeled images, virtually rendered 3D worlds have recently gained popularity.	Semantic Scholar
Unfortunately, creating realistic 3D content is challenging on its own and requires significant human effort.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we propose an alternative paradigm which combines real and synthetic data for learning semantic instance segmentation and object detection models.	Semantic Scholar
Exploiting the fact that not all aspects of the scene are equally important for this task, we propose to augment real-world imagery with virtual objects of the target category.	Semantic Scholar
Capturing real-world images at large scale is easy and cheap, and directly provides real background appearances without the need for creating complex 3D models of the environment.	Semantic Scholar
We present an efficient procedure to augment these images with virtual objects.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to modeling complete 3D environments, our data augmentation approach requires only a few user interactions in combination with 3D models of the target object category.	Semantic Scholar
Leveraging our approach, we introduce a novel dataset of augmented urban driving scenes with 360 degree images that are used as environment maps to create realistic lighting and reflections on rendered objects.	Semantic Scholar
We analyze the significance of realistic object placement by comparing manual placement by humans to automatic methods based on semantic scene analysis.	Semantic Scholar
This allows us to create composite images which exhibit both realistic background appearance as well as a large number of complex object arrangements.	Semantic Scholar
Through an extensive set of experiments, we conclude the right set of parameters to produce augmented data which can maximally enhance the performance of instance segmentation models.	Semantic Scholar
Further, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach on training standard deep models for semantic instance segmentation and object detection of cars in outdoor driving scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
We test the models trained on our augmented data on the KITTI 2015 dataset, which we have annotated with pixel-accurate ground truth, and on the Cityscapes dataset.	Semantic Scholar
Our experiments demonstrate that the models trained on augmented imagery generalize better than those trained on fully synthetic data or models trained on limited amounts of annotated real data.	Semantic Scholar

The state-of-the-art method IMM is based on the reverse influence sampling (RIS) framework.	Semantic Scholar
By using the martingale technique, it greatly outperforms the previous methods in efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
However, IMM still has limitations in scalability due to the high overhead of deciding a tight sample size.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, instead of spending the effort on deciding a tight sample size, we present a novel bottom-<italic>k</italic> sketch based RIS framework, namely BKRIS, which brings the order of samples into the RIS framework.	Semantic Scholar
By applying the sketch technique, we can derive early termination conditions to significantly accelerate the seed set selection procedure.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we provide a cost-effective method to find a proper sample size to bound the quality of returned result.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we provide several optimization techniques to reduce the cost of generating samples’ order and efficiently deal with the worst-case scenario.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method over 10 real world datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Compared with the IMM approach, BKRIS can achieve up to two orders of magnitude speedup with almost the same influence spread.	Semantic Scholar
In the largest dataset with 1.8 billion edges, BKRIS can return 50 seeds in 1.3 seconds and return 5,000 seeds in 36.6 seconds.	Semantic Scholar

The exploration of team-goal is realized by allowing the agents, capable of reaching their goals, to wait at their individual goal states, until remaining agents explore their individual goals synchronously or asynchronously.	Semantic Scholar
To avoid unwanted never-ending wait-loops, an upper bound to wait-interval, obtained empirically for the waiting team members, is introduced.	Semantic Scholar
Selection of joint action, which is a crucial problem in traditional multi-agent Q-learning, is performed here by taking the intersection of individual preferred joint actions of all the agents.	Semantic Scholar
In case the resulting intersection is a null set, the individual actions are selected randomly or otherwise following classical multi-agent Q-learning.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown both theoretically and experimentally that the extended algorithms outperform its traditional counterpartwith respect to speed of convergence.	Semantic Scholar
To ensure selection of right joint action at each step of planning, we offer high rewards to exploration of the team-goal and zero rewards to exploration of individual goals during the learning phase.	Semantic Scholar
The introduction of the above strategy results in an enriched joint Q-table, the consultation of which during the multi-agent planning yields significant improvement in the performance of cooperative planning of robots.	Semantic Scholar
Hardwired realization of the proposed learning based planning algorithm, designed for objecttransportation application, confirms the relative merits of the proposed technique over contestant algorithms.	Semantic Scholar

Yield enhancement is crucial for the companies’ profitability performance, especially during the development and mass production phases.	Semantic Scholar
So, the root causes of yield loss should be quickly identified in these stages for saving the production cost.	Semantic Scholar
To identify the root causes, traditional yield enhancement approaches collect all production-related data for big data analysis.	Semantic Scholar
Nevertheless, since the production-related data are often large and complicated, it is difficult to quickly search for the root causes that affect the yield.	Semantic Scholar
In light of this, the Key-variable Search Algorithm (KSA) (F.-T. Cheng et al., “A scheme of high-dimensional key-variable search algorithms for yield improvement,” IEEE Robot Autom.	Semantic Scholar
Lett., vol.	Semantic Scholar
2, no.	Semantic Scholar
1, pp.	Semantic Scholar
179–186, Jan. 2017), was proposed to resolve this problem.	Semantic Scholar
The KSA scheme provides users a quick and efficient way to identify the root causes of the yield.	Semantic Scholar
However, when a process constituted a single device or when a process has several devices with the same defect density, the KSA cannot make correct identification if the root cause is in the device mentioned above.	Semantic Scholar
This is the so-called blind-stage problem.	Semantic Scholar
The purpose of this letter is to propose a Blind-stage Search Algorithm for resolving this blind-stage problem.	Semantic Scholar
Weakly supervised object detection is an interesting yet challenging research topic in computer vision community, which aims at learning object models to localize and detect the corresponding objects of interest only under the supervision of image-level annotation.	Semantic Scholar
For addressing this problem, this paper establishes a novel weakly supervised learning framework to leverage both the instance-level prior-knowledge and the image-level prior-knowledge based on a novel collaborative self-paced curriculum learning (C-SPCL) regime.	Semantic Scholar
Under the weak supervision, C-SPCL can leverage helpful prior-knowledge throughout the whole learning process and collaborate the instance-level confidence inference with the image-level confidence inference in a robust way.	Semantic Scholar
Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior capacity of the proposed C-SPCL regime and the proposed whole framework as compared with state-of-the-art methods along this research line.	Semantic Scholar
With the continued proliferation of location-based services, a growing number of web-accessible data objects are geo-tagged and have text descriptions.	Semantic Scholar

Semantic Scholar
In some cases, it can be difficult for users to specify appropriate query parameters.	Semantic Scholar
After getting a query result, users may find some desired objects are unexpectedly missing and may therefore question the entire result.	Semantic Scholar
Enabling why-not questions in this setting may aid users to retrieve better results, thus improving the overall utility of the query functionality.	Semantic Scholar

We propose efficient query refinement techniques to revive missing objects by minimally modifying users’ direction-aware queries.	Semantic Scholar
We prove that the best refined query directions lie in a finite solution space for a special case and reduce the search for the optimal refinement to a linear programming problem for the general case.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed techniques outperform a baseline method by two orders of magnitude and are robust in a broad range of settings.	Semantic Scholar
In an online environment, jobs arrive over time and there is no information in advance about how many jobs are going to be processed and what their processing times are going to be.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study the online scheduling of Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) and Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) instances that are well-known NP-complete problems.	Semantic Scholar
Typical online machine scheduling approaches assume that jobs are completed at some point in order to minimize functions related to completion time (e.g., makespan, minimum lateness, total weighted tardiness, etc).	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we formalize and present an online over time problem where arriving instances are subject to waiting time constraints.	Semantic Scholar
We propose computational approaches that combine the use of machine learning, MIP, and instance interruption heuristics.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike other approaches, we attempt to maximize the number of solved instances using single and multiple machine configurations.	Semantic Scholar
Our empirical evaluation with well-known SAT and MIP instances, suggest that our interruption heuristics can improve generic ordering policies to solve up to 21.6x and 12.2x more SAT and MIP instances.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, our hybrid approach observed up to 90% of solved instances with respect to a semi clairvoyant policy (SCP).	Semantic Scholar
Due to linear perspective, the visual stimulus provided by a previewed reference trajectory reduces with increasing distance ahead.	Semantic Scholar
This paper investigates the effects of linear perspective on human use of preview in manual control tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Results of a human-in-the-loop tracking experiment are presented, where the linear perspective's horizontal and vertical deformations along the previewed trajectory were applied separately and combined, or were absent (plan-view task).	Semantic Scholar
Measurements are analyzed with both nonparametric and parametric system identification techniques, in combination with a quasi-linear human controller model for plan-view preview tracking tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that reduced visual stimuli in perspective tasks evoke less aggressive control behavior, but that the human's underlying control mechanisms are still accurately captured by the model.	Semantic Scholar
We conclude that human controllers use preview information similar in plan-view and perspective tasks.	Semantic Scholar

Robot-aided neuro-rehabilitation is a potential solution to help resolve the increasing demand for post-stroke therapy.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose an assistive-resistive approach to promote active patient participation during robotic therapy.	Semantic Scholar
In order to automatically determine the most appropriate level of task difficulty, we recommend a novel approach for real-time adaptation of the robotic assistance according to the instantaneous patient's participation and performance.	Semantic Scholar
First, we estimated the dynamic con tribution of the patient from robot's torque and kinematic data.	Semantic Scholar
Second, we adapted the stiffness parameter of the robot's impedance control according to the purported patient's participation.	Semantic Scholar
And third, we adapted the robotic assistance according to his/her performance while playing a serious game.	Semantic Scholar
We present the results of a feasibility study in which we evaluated our methodology with four persons with impairments due to stroke in a single session using the ankle robot.	Semantic Scholar
Our proposed metric for performance and participation has potential implications for real-time assessment during robot-assisted therapy.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed adaptive strategy, when compared to a fixed-stiffness approach, allows more kinematic variability in patient-led movements without compromising the overall performance during therapy.	Semantic Scholar

A chiller plant includes chillers, cooling towers, and pumps.	Semantic Scholar
Chiller minimum up/down times (MUDTs) are relatively long among a plant but short as compared with the time interval.	Semantic Scholar
MUDT constraints are generally ignored in optimization but handled heuristically.	Semantic Scholar
With the numbers of active units and nonlinear heat exchange, chiller plant optimization is a mixed-integer nonlinear problem.	Semantic Scholar
Complexity of the problem will increase if MUDT constraints are considered.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, potential energy savings and complexity increase caused by considering such constraints are explored.	Semantic Scholar
To obtain near-optimal solutions efficiently, a method is developed based on a recent decomposition and coordination approach.	Semantic Scholar
Chiller subproblems are solved in two steps, first without MUDT constraints to establish stage-wise costs.	Semantic Scholar
Then, possible state transitions are developed based on MUDT constraints from the states with feasible costs before dynamic programming (DP) is used.	Semantic Scholar
For practical problems, MUDT constraints are rarely violated.	Semantic Scholar
A second method is developed with DP replaced by local search to reduce computational effort.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical testing shows that our second method is faster and without much performance degradation as compared with the first one.	Semantic Scholar
However, energy savings are small with complexity increased significantly by using both methods as compared with those where MUDTs are handled after optimization.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, there is no need to consider MUDT constraints in optimization.	Semantic Scholar
Nature has exploited softness and compliance in many different forms, from large cephalopods to microbial bacteria and algae.	Semantic Scholar
In all these cases, large body deformations are used for both object manipulation and locomotion.	Semantic Scholar
The great potential of soft robotics is to capture and replicate these capabilities in controllable robotic form.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents the design of a bioinspired actuator capable of achieving a large volumetric change.	Semantic Scholar
Inspired by the changes in body shape seen in the euglena Eutreptiella spirogyra during its characteristic locomotion, a novel soft pneumatic actuator has been designed that exploits the hyperelastic properties of elastomers.	Semantic Scholar
We call this the hyperelastic bellows (HEB) actuator.	Semantic Scholar
The result is a structure that works under both positive and negative pressure to achieve euglenoid-like multimodal actuation.	Semantic Scholar
Axial expansion of 450% and a radial expansion of 80% have been observed, along with a volumetric change of 300 times.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the design of a segmented robot with multiple chambers is presented, which demonstrates several of the characteristic shapes adopted by the euglenoid in its locomotion cycle.	Semantic Scholar
This letter shows the potential of this new soft actuation mechanism to realise biomimetic soft robotics with giant shape changes.	Semantic Scholar
This letter reviews the source code published with the papers of a flagship robotics research conference, 2017 International Conference on Robotics and Automation.	Semantic Scholar
The aim is to investigate whether the code is actually useful, i.e., can be reused by an interested reader without much effort.	Semantic Scholar
The interest is twofold: for one side, it makes possible to replicate and validate the results of the research; for another side, it facilitates new progress on the field, since researchers can build new systems on top of existing work.	Semantic Scholar
Unfortunately, reusing code is not as straightforward as it could seem, and there is a need for tools that alleviate the effort for integrating someone else's code into the own user's system.	Semantic Scholar
We propose the use of Docker, a Linux container technology, to turn the source code repositories into executable images, that can be run and tested locally, in an isolated environment, without the need of a costly integration with the host system.	Semantic Scholar
A variety of magnetic devices can be manipulated remotely using a single permanent “actuator” magnet positioned in space by a robotic manipulator.	Semantic Scholar
This paper describes the spherical-actuator-magnet manipulator (SAMM), which is designed to replace or augment the singularity-prone spherical wrist used by prior permanent-magnet manipulation systems.	Semantic Scholar
The SAMM uses three omniwheels to enable holonomic control of the heading of its magnet's dipole and to enable its magnet to be rotated continuously about any axis of rotation.	Semantic Scholar
The SAMM performs closed-loop control of its dipole's heading using field measurements obtained from Hall-effect sensors as feedback, combined with modeled dynamics, using an extended Kalman filter.	Semantic Scholar
We describe the operation and construction of the SAMM, develop and characterize controllers for the SAMM's spherical magnet, and demonstrate remote actuation of an untethered magnetic device in a lumen using the SAMM.	Semantic Scholar
The paper describes a control architecture for industrial robotic applications allowing human/robot interactions, using an admittance control scheme and direct sensing of the human inputs.	Semantic Scholar
The aim of the proposed scheme is to support the operator of an industrial robot, equipped with a force/torque (F/T) sensor on the end-effector, during human/robot collaboration tasks involving heavy payloads carried by the robot.	Semantic Scholar
In these practical applications, the dynamics of the load may significatively affect the measurements of the F/T sensor.	Semantic Scholar
Model-based compensation of such dynamic effects requires to compute linear acceleration and angular acceleration/velocity of the load, that in this paper are estimated by means of a quaternion-based Kalman filter and assuming that the only available measurements come from the forward kinematics of the robot.

We qualitatively assess the quality of the schemes based on the skyline of efficiency and utility, i.e., based on whether a method is dominated on both aspects or not.	Semantic Scholar
Using exhaustive experiments on four real datasets with different characteristics, we conclude that there are always trade-offs in terms of utility and efficiency.	Semantic Scholar

In human factors and ergonomics (HF/E), conventional methods of human performance evaluation usually require the efforts of trained personnel for data collection, data analysis, and the explanation of results.	Semantic Scholar

In this paper, the authors conduct a scoping review of the studies published from 2001 to 2017 that focused on wearable sensor technology and propose a framework to summarize the research topics.	Semantic Scholar
The main steps in the framework include data collection, data processing, and system feedback.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, considering the gaps between current HF/E studies of wearables and the available resources, the authors conducted a detailed review of the application of wearables in HF/E human work evaluation.	Semantic Scholar
The opportunities and challenges of introducing wearable sensors into HF/E evaluation are discussed.	Semantic Scholar
Today digital sources supply a historically unprecedented component of human sensorimotor data, the consumption of which is correlated with poorly understood maladies such as Internet addiction disorder and Internet gaming disorder.	Semantic Scholar
Because both natural and digital sensorimotor data share common mathematical descriptions, one can quantify our informational sensorimotor needs using the signal processing metrics of entropy, noise, dimensionality, continuity, latency, and bandwidth.	Semantic Scholar
Such metrics describe in neutral terms the informational diet human brains require to self-calibrate, allowing individuals to maintain trusting relationships.	Semantic Scholar
With these metrics, we define the trust humans experience using the mathematical language of computational models, that is, as a primitive statistical algorithm processing finely grained sensorimotor data from neuromechanical interaction.	Semantic Scholar
This definition of neuromechanical trust implies that artificial sensorimotor inputs and interactions that attract low-level attention through frequent discontinuities and enhanced coherence will decalibrate a brain's representation of its world over the long term by violating the implicit statistical contract for which self-calibration evolved.	Semantic Scholar
Our hypersimplified mathematical understanding of human sensorimotor processing as multiscale, continuous-time vibratory interaction allows equally broad-brush descriptions of failure modes and solutions.	Semantic Scholar
For example, we model addiction in general as the result of homeostatic regulation gone awry in novel environments (sign reversal) and digital dependency as a sub-case in which the decalibration caused by digital sensorimotor data spurs yet more consumption of them.	Semantic Scholar
We predict that institutions can use these sensorimotor metrics to quantify media richness to improve employee well-being; that dyads and family-size groups will bond and heal best through low-latency, high-resolution multisensory interaction such as shared meals and reciprocated touch; and that individuals can improve sensory and sociosensory resolution through deliberate sensory reintegration practices.

We conclude that we humans are the victims of our own success, our hands so skilled they fill the world with captivating things, our eyes so innocent they follow eagerly.	Semantic Scholar
Spike-timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) is a learning mechanism that can capture causal relationships between events.	Semantic Scholar
STDP is considered a foundational element of memory and learning in biological neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
Previous research efforts endeavored to understand the functionality of STDP's learning window in spiking neural networks (SNNs).	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we investigate the interaction among different encoding/decoding schemes, STDP learning windows and normalization rules for the SNN classifier, trained and tested on MNIST, NIST and ETH80-Contour datasets.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that when no normalization rules are applied, classical STDP typically achieves the best performance.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, first-spike decoding classifiers require much less decoding time than a spike count decoding classifier.	Semantic Scholar
Thirdly, when no normalization rule is applied, the classifier accuracy decreases as the encoding duration increases from 10ms to 34ms using count decoding scheme.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, normalization of output weights is shown to improve the performance of a first-spike decoding classifier, which reveals the importance of weight normalization to SNN.	Semantic Scholar

How does it relate to classical concepts, which appear much less well defined than expected?	Semantic Scholar
A summary of critical answers to these questions is sketched below.	Semantic Scholar
Then five theses about cognition are summarized: cognition to know the real world, to explore and perceive, to model; cognition for defining alternative worlds and possible futures, visions, and anticausality; cognition for effective control; cognitics for a large scale, technical deployment of cognition; and social cognitics, a foundation for team action and increased momentum for change.

The five theses can be seen both as paths towards better insights in human and social nature and also as a roadmap for simultaneous and iterative processes capable to freely foster a better future for individuals and society.	Semantic Scholar

In addition, we define an Rely-Guarantee program logic supporting an incremental proof methodology where annotations and invariants can be progressively enriched.	Semantic Scholar
We formalize the intermediate representation, the proof system, and prove the soundness of the methodology in the Coq proof assistant.	Semantic Scholar

This letter proposes a multifunctional ankle exoskeleton to safely expand the mobility.	Semantic Scholar
By applying torque to the ankle in dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, the exoskeleton prevents foot drop and foot slip and helps the ankle to push off the ground.	Semantic Scholar
The exoskeleton includes a remote center-of-motion (RCM) mechanism, a linear actuation module, and fastening modules.	Semantic Scholar
The RCM mechanism, which has two degrees of freedom, is designed to be aligned with the talocrural and subtalar axes of the ankle.	Semantic Scholar
A key feature of the RCM mechanism is a three-dimensional combination of two four-bar linkage mechanisms that have the linear motion and rotational motion, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
Only the talocrural axis is actively actuated for dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the ankle, whereas the subtalar axis is passively released to allow the unconstrained motion by the user.	Semantic Scholar
The active axis is driven by a linear actuation mechanism comprising a ball-screw and a brushless dc motor.	Semantic Scholar
The device can be separated into fastening modules and actuation module and weighs only 869 g/leg without the battery.	Semantic Scholar
The results of ground and treadmill tests indicate that the peak torque and average positive mechanical power delivered by the exoskeleton are approximately 20 N·m and 6.21 W, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
With the increasing complexity of modern industrial automatic and robotic systems, a burden is placed on system operators, who are required to supervise and interact with very complex systems, typically under difficult and stressful conditions.	Semantic Scholar
To overcome these challenges, it is necessary to adopt a responsible approach based on an anthropocentric design methodology so that machines adapt to human capabilities rather than vice versa.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we consider an integrated methodological design approach, referred to as measure, adapt, and teach (MATE), which consists of devising complex automatic or robotic solutions that measure the current operator's status and adapting the interaction accordingly, while providing him or her with the necessary skills and expertise to improve the interaction.

As the use of soft robotics and soft actuators becomes more popular, there is also an increased need for soft sensors that can perform robustly under various extreme conditions.	Semantic Scholar

Previous work in highly stretchable sensing modalities commonly uses liquid conductors that couple a change in measured electrical resistance with applied stress.	Semantic Scholar
However, liquid conductors are expensive and difficult to encapsulate, leading to leakages that can damage machinery.	Semantic Scholar

It presents a low cost but an efficient vision-based system allowing to detect accurately, quickly, and robustly the trees.	Semantic Scholar
It is made of four stereo cameras that provide a point cloud characterizing the environment.	Semantic Scholar
The key idea is to find the tree trunks by detecting their shadows, which are materialized by concavities in the obtained point cloud.	Semantic Scholar
In this way, branches and leaves are not taken into account, improving the detection robustness and, therefore, the navigation strategy.	Semantic Scholar
The method has been implemented using robot operating system (ROS) and validated using data sequences taken in several different orchards.	Semantic Scholar
The obtained results definitely validate the approach and its performances show that the processing time (around 1 ms) is sufficiently short for the data to be used at the control level.	Semantic Scholar
A comparison with other approaches from the literature is also provided.	Semantic Scholar
We discuss the global stability of switching Hopfield neural networks (HNN) with state-dependent impulses using B-equivalence method.	Semantic Scholar

On this basis, a novel stability criterion for the considered HNN is established.	Semantic Scholar

On the other hand, news editors rely on social media for following their audience’s attention and for crowd-sourcing news stories.	Semantic Scholar
Twitter hashtags function as a key connection between Twitter crowds and the news media, by naturally naming and contextualizing stories, grouping the discussion of news and marking topic trends.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we propose Hashtagger+, an efficient learning-to-rank framework for merging news and social streams in real-time, by recommending Twitter hashtags to news articles.	Semantic Scholar
We provide an extensive study of different approaches for streaming hashtag recommendation, and show that pointwise learning-to-rank is more effective than multi-class classification as well as more complex learning-to-rank approaches.	Semantic Scholar
We improve the efficiency and coverage of a state-of-the-art hashtag recommendation model by proposing new techniques for data collection and feature computation.	Semantic Scholar
In our comprehensive evaluation on real-data, we show that we drastically outperform the accuracy and efficiency of prior methods.	Semantic Scholar
Our prototype system delivers recommendations in under 1 minute, with a Precision@1 of 94 percent and article coverage of 80 percent.	Semantic Scholar
This is an order of magnitude faster than prior approaches, and brings improvements of 5 percent in precision and 20 percent in coverage.	Semantic Scholar
By effectively linking the news stream to the social stream via the recommended hashtags, we open the door to solving many challenging problems related to story detection and tracking.	Semantic Scholar
To showcase this potential, we present an application of our recommendations to automated news story tracking via social tags.	Semantic Scholar
Our recommendation framework is implemented in a real-time Web system available from insight4news.ucd.ie.	Semantic Scholar
This letter deals with the problem of controlling a robotic system whose joints have bounded position, velocity, and acceleration/torque.	Semantic Scholar
Assuming a discrete-time acceleration control, we compute tight bounds on the current joint accelerations that ensure the existence of a feasible trajectory in the future.	Semantic Scholar
Despite the clear practical importance of this issue, no complete and exact solution has been proposed yet, and all existing control architectures rely on hand-tuned heuristics.	Semantic Scholar
We also extend this methodology to torque-controlled robots, for which joint accelerations are only indirectly bounded by the torque limits.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical simulations are presented to validate the proposed method, which is computationally efficient and hence suitable for high-frequency control.	Semantic Scholar
Recent theoretical and experimental studies suggest that in multisensory conditions, the brain performs a near-optimal Bayesian estimate of external events, giving more weight to the more reliable stimuli.	Semantic Scholar
However, the neural mechanisms responsible for this behavior, and its progressive maturation in a multisensory environment, are still insufficiently understood.	Semantic Scholar
The aim of this letter is to analyze this problem with a neural network model of audiovisual integration, based on probabilistic population coding—the idea that a population of neurons can encode probability functions to perform Bayesian inference.	Semantic Scholar
The model consists of two chains of unisensory neurons (auditory and visual) topologically organized.	Semantic Scholar
They receive the corresponding input through a plastic receptive field and reciprocally exchange plastic cross-modal synapses, which encode the spatial co-occurrence of visual-auditory inputs.	Semantic Scholar
A third chain of multisensory neurons performs a simple sum of auditory and visual excitations.	Semantic Scholar
The work includes a theoretical part and a computer simulation study.	Semantic Scholar
We show how a simple rule for synapse learning (consisting of Hebbian reinforcement and a decay term) can be used during training to shrink the receptive fields and encode the unisensory likelihood functions.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, after training, each unisensory area realizes a maximum likelihood estimate of stimulus position (auditory or visual).	Semantic Scholar
In cross-modal conditions, the same learning rule can encode information on prior probability into the cross-modal synapses.	Semantic Scholar
Computer simulations confirm the theoretical results and show that the proposed network can realize a maximum likelihood estimate of auditory (or visual) positions in unimodal conditions and a Bayesian estimate, with moderate deviations from optimality, in cross-modal conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the model explains the ventriloquism illusion and, looking at the activity in the multimodal neurons, explains the automatic reweighting of auditory and visual inputs on a trial-by-trial basis, according to the reliability of the individual cues.	Semantic Scholar
A robot audio localization system is presented that combines the outputs of multiple adaptive filter models of the Cerebellum to calibrate a robot's audio map for various acoustic environments.	Semantic Scholar
The system is inspired by the MOdular Selection for Identification and Control (MOSAIC) framework.	Semantic Scholar
This study extends our previous work that used multiple cerebellar models to determine the acoustic environment in which a robot is operating.	Semantic Scholar
Here, the system selects a set of models and combines their outputs in proportion to the likelihood that each is responsible for calibrating the audio map as a robot moves between different acoustic environments or contexts.	Semantic Scholar
The system was able to select an appropriate set of models, achieving a performance better than that of a single model trained in all contexts, including novel contexts, as well as a baseline generalized cross correlation with phase transform sound source localization algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The main contribution of this letter is the combination of multiple calibrators to allow a robot operating in the field to adapt to a range of different acoustic environments.	Semantic Scholar
The best performances were observed where the presence of a Responsibility Predictor was simulated.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the development of deep learning networks, a salient object detection based on deep learning networks, which are used to extract the features, has made a great breakthrough compared to the traditional methods.	Semantic Scholar
At present, the salient object detection mainly relies on very deep convolutional network, which is used to extract the features.	Semantic Scholar
In deep learning networks, an dramatic increase of network depth may cause more training errors instead.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we use the residual network to increase network depth and to mitigate the errors caused by depth increase simultaneously.	Semantic Scholar
Inspired by image simplification, we use color and texture features to obtain simplified image with multiple scales by means of region assimilation on the basis of super-pixels in order to reduce the complexity of images and to improve the accuracy of salient target detection.	Semantic Scholar
We refine the feature on pixel level by the multi-scale feature correction method to avoid the feature error when the image is simplified at the above-mentioned region level.	Semantic Scholar
The final full connection layer not only integrates features of multi-scale and multi-level but also works as classifier of salient targets.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results show that proposed model achieves better results than other salient object detection models based on original deep learning networks.	Semantic Scholar

This paper summarizes and synthesizes the existing literature relevant to pedestrian receptivity toward Fully Automated Vehicles (FAVs).	Semantic Scholar
Objectives of this review are to identify research gaps that need to be filled and to propose a roadmap for future research.	Semantic Scholar
Since FAVs are operated by software and hardware, with no human driver required, interactions between other road users and FAVs must be understood, and potential risks must be addressed.	Semantic Scholar
This is especially true for pedestrians, who often exhibit unpredictable behavior and are one of the most vulnerable road-user groups.	Semantic Scholar
A comprehensive review was conducted of 1) different aspects of pedestrian interaction with forthcoming fully automated vehicles, and 2) the existing research approaches (surveys and simulator studies) for investigating risky pedestrian behavior as well as public acceptance of fully automated vehicles.	Semantic Scholar
The review identified three major gaps in pedestrian research: 1) lack of a pedestrian behavior questionnaire for FAV research, 2) lack of a validated pedestrian simulator for FAV research, and 3) lack of research investigating pedestrian design suggestions for FAVs.	Semantic Scholar
A future research roadmap to facilitate investigating pedestrian receptivity toward FAVs was designed.	Semantic Scholar
Achieving pedestrian acceptance of FAVs will require investigation of pedestrian risks and needs by transportation researchers and communication of the results to vehicle manufacturers and regulatory agencies.	Semantic Scholar
This review will be useful to transportation researchers and automated vehicle manufacturers to help guide planning for future design and production of FAVs in order to ensure their successful implementation.	Semantic Scholar
Exploiting graph-structured data has many real applications in domains including natural language semantics, programming language processing, and malware analysis.	Semantic Scholar
A variety of methods has been developed to deal with such data.	Semantic Scholar
However, learning graphs of large-scale, varying shapes and sizes is a big challenge for any method.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a multi-view multi-layer convolutional neural network on labeled directed graphs (DGCNN), in which convolutional filters are designed flexibly to adapt to dynamic structures of local regions inside graphs.	Semantic Scholar
The advantages of DGCNN are that we do not need to align vertices between graphs, and that DGCNN can process large-scale dynamic graphs with hundred thousands of nodes.	Semantic Scholar
To verify the effectiveness of DGCNN, we conducted experiments on two tasks: malware analysis and software defect prediction.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that DGCNN outperforms the baselines, including several deep neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
Visual and audiovisual speech recognition are witnessing a renaissance which is largely due to the advent of deep learning methods.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a deep learning architecture for lipreading and audiovisual word recognition, which combines Residual Networks equipped with spatiotemporal input layers and Bidirectional LSTMs.	Semantic Scholar
The lipreading architecture attains 11.92% misclassification rate on the challenging Lipreading-In-The-Wild database, which is composed of excerpts from BBC-TV, each containing one of the 500 target words.	Semantic Scholar
Audiovisual experiments are performed using both intermediate and late integration, as well as several types and levels of environmental noise, and notable improvements over the audio-only network are reported, even in the case of clean speech.	Semantic Scholar
A further analysis on the utility of target word boundaries is provided, as well as on the capacity of the network in modeling the linguistic context of the target word.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we examine difficult word pairs and discuss how visual information helps towards attaining higher recognition accuracy.	Semantic Scholar

Effective real-time feedback is crucial to enhance motor learning in physical and cognitive rehabilitation.	Semantic Scholar
Although monitor-based (MB) platforms are widely used to provide visual feedback for users, the discrepancy between where the feedback is presented and where the actual movement occurs can negatively affect the use of feedback.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a novel visual feedback system using projection-based augmented reality (AR) to provide a better understanding of the relationship between body perception and movement kinematics.	Semantic Scholar
A set of experiments were performed to assess and compare the ability of unimpaired and impaired participants to detect real-time feedback and make modifications to gait using this feedback in MB and AR platforms.	Semantic Scholar
The results showed a significant improvement in participants’ ability to better adapt the changes in projection-based AR than MB.	Semantic Scholar
This improvement represents the efficacy of this system in enabling users to better synchronize their foot–eye coordination.	Semantic Scholar

In this study, I considered quantifying the strength of chaos in the population firing rate of a pulse-coupled neural network.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, I considered the dynamics where the population firing rate is chaotic and the firing of each neuron is stochastic.	Semantic Scholar
I calculated a time histogram of firings to show the variation in the population firing rate over time.	Semantic Scholar
To smooth this histogram, I used Bayesian adaptive regression splines and a gaussian filter.	Semantic Scholar
The nonlinear prediction method, based on reconstruction, was applied to a sequence of interpeak intervals in the smoothed time histogram of firings.	Semantic Scholar
I propose the use of the sum of nonlinearity as a quantifier of the strength of chaos.	Semantic Scholar
When applying this method to the firings of a pulse-coupled neural network, the sum of nonlinearity was seen to satisfy three properties for quantifying the strength of chaos.	Semantic Scholar
First, it can be calculated from spiking data alone.	Semantic Scholar
Second, it takes large values when applied to firings that are confirmed, theoretically or numerically, to be chaotic.	Semantic Scholar
Third, it reflects the strength of chaos of the original dynamics.	Semantic Scholar

Generalized arc-consistency propagation is predominantly used in constraint solvers to efficiently prune the search space when solving constraint satisfaction problems.	Semantic Scholar
Although many practical applications can be modelled as distributed constraint satisfaction problems, no distributed arc-consistency algorithms so far have considered the privacy of individual agents.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a new distributed arc-consistency algorithm, called $$\mathsf {DisAC3.1}$$ DisAC3.1 , which leaks less private information of agents than existing distributed arc-consistency algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, $$\mathsf {DisAC3.1}$$ DisAC3.1 uses a novel termination determination mechanism, which allows the agents to share domains, constraints and communication addresses only with relevant agents.	Semantic Scholar
We further extend $$\mathsf {DisAC3.1}$$ DisAC3.1 to $$\mathsf {DisGAC3.1}$$ DisGAC3.1 , which is the first distributed algorithm that enforces generalized arc-consistency on k-ary ($$k\ge 2$$ k≥2 ) constraint satisfaction problems.	Semantic Scholar
Theoretical analyses show that our algorithms are efficient in both time and space.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments also demonstrate that $$\mathsf {DisAC3.1}$$ DisAC3.1 outperforms the state-of-the-art distributed arc-consistency algorithm and that $$\mathsf {DisGAC3.1}$$ DisGAC3.1 ’s performance scales linearly in the number of agents.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a complete probabilistic tactile-based framework to enable robots to autonomously explore unknown workspaces and recognize objects based on their physical properties.	Semantic Scholar
Our framework consists of three components: 1) an active pretouch strategy to efficiently explore unknown workspaces; 2) an active touch learning method to learn about unknown objects based on their physical properties (surface texture, stiffness, and thermal conductivity) with the least number of training samples; and 3) an active touch algorithm for object discrimination, which selects the most informative exploratory action to apply to the object, so that the robot can efficiently distinguish between objects with a few number of actions.	Semantic Scholar
Our proposed framework was experimentally evaluated using a robotic arm equipped with multimodal artificial skin.	Semantic Scholar
The robot with the active pretouch method reduced the uncertainty of the workspace up to 30% and 70% compared to uniform and random strategies, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
By means of the active touch learning algorithm, the robot used 50% fewer samples to achieve the same learning accuracy than the baseline methods.	Semantic Scholar
By taking advantage of the prior knowledge obtained during the learning process, the robot actively discriminated objects with an improvement of 10% recognition accuracy compare to the random action selection approach.	Semantic Scholar
This paper addresses the problem of controlling the hopping height and stride length of a monoped hydraulic robot.	Semantic Scholar
Hopping over discontinuous, rough terrain with limited surfaces suitable for foot placement requires a controller capable of adjusting the hop height and landing foot position of the robot on each step.	Semantic Scholar
This motivates the need for an agile controller that uses the short window of time while the foot is on the ground (the stance phase) to exert the required action to reach the next landing position.	Semantic Scholar
This paper contributes a simple yet effective adaptive controller capable of changing the flight time within a single hop.	Semantic Scholar
The controller does not require force feedback and is capable of self-tuning its feedback gain parameters in response to changing ground parameters using the results of previous hops.	Semantic Scholar
The main contribution of the paper is the development of an analytical understanding of why the controller is capable of adjusting the height in a single step and how the errors in the achieved height can be used to tune automatically the controller gains.	Semantic Scholar
This allows the controller to be successfully implemented even if the conditions or parameters are initially unknown, automatically correcting for errors.	Semantic Scholar
The controller is first derived for height control of hopping vertically, with no horizontal motion, from an analytical approximation.	Semantic Scholar
This is tested in simulation, using a spring-damper model and a more detailed model with a foot mass and compliant ground.	Semantic Scholar
The controller is then applied to a hydraulic spring-loaded hopper monoped.	Semantic Scholar
An extension allows the control of running on a treadmill, with constant horizontal speed.	Semantic Scholar
Recognizing object location by taking a photo with smartphones is useful for many location-based services.	Semantic Scholar
However, start-of-the-art technologies for both localization and location recognition have difficulty in achieving satisfactory performance.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, it is a challenging issue to construct and maintain a large-scale image database for existing visual-based location recognition systems.	Semantic Scholar
To cope with these issues, we introduce CrowdOLR, a crowdsourcing based object location recognition system, which collects one location image together with various rich sensory data (GPS coordinates, azimuth angle, tilt angle, etc.)	Semantic Scholar
as a fingerprint of a location query and matches it to a fingerprint database crowdsourced from users’ smartphones.	Semantic Scholar
We designed a simple and efficient user action mode and proposed a series of fingerprint extracting, searching, and matching methods, so that CrowdOLR satisfies five desirable properties: high recognition accuracy, user friendliness, quick response, no/little site survey, and timely update.	Semantic Scholar
We implemented CrowdOLR and collected 8100 location fingerprints of 162 objects for performance evaluation.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CrowdOLR achieves promising results in various complicated and realistic scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a natural framework for information sharing in cooperative tasks involving humans and robots.	Semantic Scholar
In this framework, all information gathered over time by a human–robot team is exchanged and summarized in the form of a fused probability density function (pdf).	Semantic Scholar
An approach for an intelligent system to describe its belief pdfs in English expressions is presented.	Semantic Scholar
This belief expression generation is achieved through two goodness measures: semantic correctness and information preservation.	Semantic Scholar
In order to describe complex, multimodal belief pdfs, a Mixture of Statements (MoS) model is proposed such that optimal expressions can be generated through compositions of multiple statements.	Semantic Scholar
The model is further extended to a nonparametric Dirichlet process MoS generation, such that the optimal number of statements required for describing a given pdf is automatically determined.	Semantic Scholar
Results based on information loss, human collaborative task performances, and correctness rating scores suggest that the proposed method for generating belief expressions is an effective approach for communicating probabilistic information between robots and humans.	Semantic Scholar
We propose algorithms to compute the three-dimensional (3-D) robust stability region in multicontact.	Semantic Scholar
It is well known that the stability region is a product of convex cones and, hence, is a convex polyhedron.	Semantic Scholar
Our stability region extends existing recursive two-dimensional (2-D) static stability approaches to 3-D by accounting for possible center-of-mass accelerations.	Semantic Scholar
We provide algorithms that construct the region of robust stability in a systematic way.	Semantic Scholar
We compare our algorithms and discuss possible computation of intermediary shapes using morphing.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we provide an example of usage in generating robust static postures that can serve the purpose of multicontact planning.	Semantic Scholar
The problem of real-time motion generation to a target with obstacle avoidance is considered.	Semantic Scholar
A second-order dynamical system having the target as a unique globally asymptotically stable equilibrium is modified in the presence of obstacles by an additive signal whose design is based on the prescribed performance control methodology.	Semantic Scholar
It is proved that obstacle avoidance and dynamical system stability are guaranteed and that the target remains asymptotically stable.	Semantic Scholar
Simulations are utilized to reveal the cases where the proposed scheme outperforms the modulated dynamical system and the constrained optimization priority framework.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results further validate the theoretical findings.	Semantic Scholar
Semantic understanding and localization are fundamental enablers of robot autonomy that have been tackled as disjoint problems for the most part.	Semantic Scholar
While deep learning has enabled recent breakthroughs across a wide spectrum of scene understanding tasks, its applicability to state estimation tasks has been limited due to the direct formulation that renders it incapable of encoding scene-specific constrains.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose the VLocNet++ architecture that employs a multitask learning approach to exploit the inter-task relationship between learning semantics, regressing 6-DoF global pose and odometry, for the mutual benefit of each of these tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Our network overcomes the aforementioned limitation by simultaneously embedding geometric and semantic knowledge of the world into the pose regression network.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel adaptive weighted fusion layer to aggregate motion-specific temporal information and to fuse semantic features into the localization stream based on region activations.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we propose a self-supervised warping technique that uses the relative motion to warp intermediate network representations in the segmentation stream for learning consistent semantics.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we introduce a first-of-a-kind urban outdoor localization dataset with pixel-level semantic labels and multiple loops for training deep networks.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on the challenging Microsoft 7-Scenes benchmark and our DeepLoc dataset demonstrate that our approach exceeds the state-of-the-art outperforming local feature-based methods while simultaneously performing multiple tasks and exhibiting substantial robustness in challenging scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we focus on modeling user-generated review and overall rating pairs, and aim to identify semantic aspects and aspect-level sentiments from review data as well as to predict overall sentiments of reviews.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel probabilistic supervised joint aspect and sentiment model (SJASM) to deal with the problems in one go under a unified framework.	Semantic Scholar
SJASM represents each review document in the form of opinion pairs, and can simultaneously model aspect terms and corresponding opinion words of the review for hidden aspect and sentiment detection.	Semantic Scholar
It also leverages sentimental overall ratings, which often come with online reviews, as supervision data, and can infer the semantic aspects and aspect-level sentiments that are not only meaningful but also predictive of overall sentiments of reviews.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we also develop efficient inference method for parameter estimation of SJASM based on collapsed Gibbs sampling.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate SJASM extensively on real-world review data, and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms seven well-established baseline methods for sentiment analysis tasks.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a novel approach to correct errors caused by accumulated scale drift in monocular SLAM.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown that the metric scale can be estimated using information gathered through monocular SLAM and image blur due to defocus.	Semantic Scholar
A nonlinear least squares optimization problem is formulated to integrate depth estimates from defocus to monocular SLAM.	Semantic Scholar
An algorithm to process the output keyframe and feature location estimates generated by a monocular SLAM algorithm to correct for scale drift at selected local regions of the environment is presented.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed algorithm is experimentally evaluated by processing the output of ORB-SLAM to obtain accurate metric scale maps from a monocular camera without any prior knowledge about the scene.	Semantic Scholar
To treat atrial fibrillation (AFib), radiofrequency ablation is usually implemented with a cardiac catheter to block abnormal electrical signals from pulmonary veins.	Semantic Scholar
However, it is challenging to manipulate a passive catheter.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the radiation exposure to patients under fluoroscopic guidance has been a concern.	Semantic Scholar
To address these two major issues, this work presents the development of a steerable and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatible cardiac catheter by using shape memory alloy (SMA) as an alternative interventional tool for AFib.	Semantic Scholar
The developed cardiac catheter is comprised of a passive and flexible tubing, and a steerable tip.	Semantic Scholar
The tip is composed of multiple bending modules and each module is actuated by a pair of antagonistic SMA wires.	Semantic Scholar
To improve the MRI-compatibility of SMA actuators, the electric current required for SMA actuation is significantly reduced by developing a technique of conductive heating actuation.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, the design and fabrication of the cardiac catheter are presented, followed by modeling the SMA bending module.	Semantic Scholar
The working performance of the SMA bending module is experimentally studied.	Semantic Scholar
In the end, a proof-of-concept demonstration of the cardiac catheter is performed in an explanted heart.	Semantic Scholar
Graphs are used for representing and understanding objects and their relationships for numerous applications such as social networks, Semantic Webs, and biological networks.	Semantic Scholar
Integrity assurance of data and query results for graph databases is an essential security requirement.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose two efficient integrity verification schemes—HMACs for graphs (gHMAC) for two-party data sharing, and redactable HMACs for graphs (rgHMAC) for third-party data sharing, such as a cloud-based graph database service.	Semantic Scholar
We compute one HMAC value for both the schemes and two other verification objects for rgHMAC scheme that are shared with the verifier.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the proposed schemes are provably secure with respect to integrity attacks on the structure and/or content of graphs and query results.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed schemes have linear complexity in terms of the number of vertices and edges in the graphs, which is shown to be optimal.	Semantic Scholar
Our experimental results corroborate that the proposed HMAC-based schemes for graphs are highly efficient as compared to the digital signature-based schemes—computation of HMAC tags is about 10 times faster than the computation of digital signatures.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a novel robotic mechanism inspired by origami and its fabrication method using three-dimensional (3D) printing.	Semantic Scholar
The selected twisted tower design shows unique structural and geometrical properties that enable bending and linear motions, and therefore, can be suitable for various robotic applications.	Semantic Scholar
However, fabrication of this origami design requires a complex sequence of paper folding and assembling by hand, which cannot be automated by existing manufacturing technologies.	Semantic Scholar
To fabricate this structure via 3D printing, the twisted tower is reconstructed in a computer aided design (CAD) model.	Semantic Scholar
The CAD model is then 3D printed using two different materials—a flexible material for creases and a rigid material for surfaces.	Semantic Scholar
The printed structure preserves the geometrical properties of the original tower.	Semantic Scholar
Associated kinematics and workspace analysis are also presented in this letter.	Semantic Scholar
The 3D printed tower is embodied into a robotic arm to physically demonstrate its potential utility.	Semantic Scholar
Many time series are considered to be a superposition of several oscillation components.	Semantic Scholar
We have proposed a method for decomposing univariate time series into oscillation components and estimating their phases (Matsuda & Komaki, 2017).	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we extend that method to multivariate time series.	Semantic Scholar
We assume that several oscillators underlie the given multivariate time series and that each variable corresponds to a superposition of the projections of the oscillators.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, the oscillators superpose on each variable with amplitude and phase modulation.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this idea, we develop gaussian linear state-space models and use them to decompose the given multivariate time series.	Semantic Scholar
The model parameters are estimated from data using the empirical Bayes method, and the number of oscillators is determined using the Akaike information criterion.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, the proposed method extracts underlying oscillators in a data-driven manner and enables investigation of phase dynamics in a given multivariate time series.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
From monthly mean north-south sunspot number data, the proposed method reveals an interesting phase relationship.	Semantic Scholar
Planning motions to grasp an object in cluttered and uncertain environments is a challenging task, particularly when a collision-free trajectory does not exist and objects obstructing the way are required to be carefully grasped and moved out.	Semantic Scholar
This letter takes a different approach and proposes to address this problem by using a randomized physics-based motion planner that permits robot–object and object–object interactions.	Semantic Scholar
The main idea is to avoid an explicit high-level reasoning of the task by providing the motion planner with a physics engine to evaluate possible complex multibody dynamical interactions.	Semantic Scholar
The approach is able to solve the problem in complex scenarios, also considering uncertainty in the objects’ pose and in the contact dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
The work enhances the state validity checker, the control sampler, and the tree exploration strategy of a kinodynamic motion planner called KPIECE.	Semantic Scholar
The enhanced algorithm, called p-KPIECE, has been validated in simulation and with real experiments.	Semantic Scholar
The results have been compared with an ontological physics-based motion planner and with task and motion planning approaches, resulting in a significant improvement in terms of planning time, success rate, and quality of the solution path.	Semantic Scholar

deciding whether the term corresponds to a correct derivation, can be verified in linear time.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we can use this syntax to define a denotational semantics for multiplicative linear logic with units by means of equivalence classes of proof diagrams modulo a terminating rewriting.	Semantic Scholar

In this paper, we propose a joint semantic preserving action attribute learning framework for action recognition from depth videos, which is built on multistream deep neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
More specifically, this paper describes the idea to explore action attributes learned from deep activations.	Semantic Scholar
Multiple stream deep neural networks rather than conventional hand-crafted low-level features are employed to learn the deep activations.	Semantic Scholar
An undirected graph is utilized to model the complex semantics among action attributes and is integrated into our proposed joint action attribute learning algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on several public datasets for action recognition demonstrate that 1) the deep activations achieve the state-ofthe-art discriminative performance as feature vectors and 2) the attribute learner can produce generic attributes, and thus obtains decent performance on zero-shot action recognition.

Differential privacy is an essential and prevalent privacy model that has been widely explored in recent decades.	Semantic Scholar
This survey provides a comprehensive and structured overview of two research directions: differentially private data publishing and differentially private data analysis.	Semantic Scholar
We compare the diverse release mechanisms of differentially private data publishing given a variety of input data in terms of query type, the maximum number of queries, efficiency, and accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
We identify two basic frameworks for differentially private data analysis and list the typical algorithms used within each framework.	Semantic Scholar
The results are compared and discussed based on output accuracy and efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
Further, we propose several possible directions for future research and possible applications.	Semantic Scholar
"We developed a fingertip-size proximity sensor that detects the distance to and the tilt angle of the surface of an object with the peak-to-peak distance error less than 1/129th (<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$<$ </tex-math></inline-formula>31 <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mu$</tex-math></inline-formula>m) and the measuring time less than 1/10th (<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$<$</tex-math></inline-formula> 1 ms) those of existing sensors."	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we realized the task of catching a fragile object (paper balloon) with a high-speed robot hand equipped with the sensor.	Semantic Scholar
High-speed, high-precision sensing enables contact detection independently of the contact force.	Semantic Scholar
We describe a robust contact detection method that does not depend on the reflectance, the tilt angle, or the shape of target objects surface.	Semantic Scholar
"In experiments, we confirmed that the sensor could measure a distance of 2.85–20 mm (resolution: 44 <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX""> $\mu$</tex-math></inline-formula>m in <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$<$</tex-math></inline-formula> 3 mm) and a tilt angle of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\pm 45^\circ$</tex-math></inline-formula>  (error: 1.47<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$^\circ$</tex-math></inline-formula>) for objects with reflectances of 18% and 90%."

In this letter, we propose the Interactive Text2Pickup (IT2P) network for human–robot collaboration that enables an effective interaction with a human user despite the ambiguity in user's commands.	Semantic Scholar
We focus on the task where a robot is expected to pick up an object instructed by a human, and to interact with the human when the given instruction is vague.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed network understands the command from the human user and estimates the position of the desired object first.	Semantic Scholar
To handle the inherent ambiguity in human language commands, a suitable question which can resolve the ambiguity is generated.	Semantic Scholar
The user's answer to the question is combined with the initial command and given back to the network, resulting in more accurate estimation.	Semantic Scholar
The experiment results show that given unambiguous commands, the proposed method can estimate the position of the requested object with an accuracy of 98.49% based on the test dataset.	Semantic Scholar
Given ambiguous language commands, we show that the accuracy of the pick up task increases by 1.94 times after incorporating the information obtained from the interaction.	Semantic Scholar
The Coalition Structure Generation (CSG) problem plays an important role in the domain of coalition games.	Semantic Scholar
Its goal is to create coalitions of agents so that the global welfare is maximized.	Semantic Scholar
To date, Weighted Partial MaxSAT (WPM) encoding has shown high efficiency in solving the CSG problem, which encodes a set of constraints into Boolean propositional logic and employs an off-the-shelf WPM solver to find out the optimal solution.	Semantic Scholar
However, in existing WPM encodings, a number of redundant encodings are asserted.	Semantic Scholar
This results in additional calculations and correspondingly incurs performance penalty.	Semantic Scholar
Against this background, this paper presents an Improved Rule Relation-based WPM (I-RWPM) encoding for the CSG problem, which is expressed by a set of weighted rules in a concise representation scheme called Marginal Contribution net (MC-net).	Semantic Scholar
In order to effectively reduce the constraints imposed on encodings, we first identify a subset of rules in an MC-net, referred as a set of freelance rules.	Semantic Scholar
We prove that solving the problem made up of all freelance rules can be achieved with a straightforward means without any extra encodings.	Semantic Scholar
Thus the set of rules requiring to be encoded is downsized.	Semantic Scholar
Next, we improve the encoding of transitive relations among rules.	Semantic Scholar
To be specific, compared with the existing rule relation-based encoding that generates transitive relations universally among all rules, I-RWPM only considers the transitivity among rules with particular relationship.	Semantic Scholar
In this way, the number of constraints to be encoded can be further decreased.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments suggest that I-RWPM significantly outperforms other WPM encodings for solving the same set of problem instances.	Semantic Scholar
Real-time grasp stability is based on successful slippage detection.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we consider slippage detection as a binary problem (slip, stable) and we propose a novel set of temporal and frequential features, extracted from force norm profiles and collected during reliable ground truth labeling processes, finally employed within the machine learning classification techniques.

Classification performance of the proposed scheme, with respect to its success and generalization ability, is assessed systematically utilizing different performance metrics that clarify class predictions as opposed to most of the reported works.	Semantic Scholar
We show that our proposed feature extraction method improves classification performance over the commonly used feature sets, even when trained with one surface, and generalizes successfully to unseen ones.	Semantic Scholar
The trained classifier is tested on a completely new task and object, for real-time slippage detection, showing high detection accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the classifier is tested in a different experimental layout with a different force sensor.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments are conducted on unseen surfaces for a variety of sampling frequencies, for both translational and rotational slippage, with the proposed approach showing fast and accurate detection in all cases.	Semantic Scholar
Stroke patients suffer from declined physical ability, and it is important to analyze rehabilitation intervention and clarify its effect on the motion of patients.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, the effect of intervention on the standing-up motion of stroke patients is investigated.	Semantic Scholar
First, the intervention timing of a physical therapist (PT) is analyzed quantitatively from the muscle activity of upper limbs during therapy.	Semantic Scholar
Next, the intervention effect is evaluated based on body kinematics and muscle synergy.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, twenty trials are conducted, in which the standing-up motion of hemiplegic patients (n=12) is measured with and without the intervention by a PT.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that PTs teach hemiplegic patients the timing of lifting their buttocks during standing-up motion.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, it has been found that this intervention could improve the standing-up motion, although stroke patients had inadequate muscle synergy structure.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, some patients had delayed activation of the synergy and they could only stood up after they moved their center of mass toward their feet.	Semantic Scholar
However, the intervention by PTs could induce earlier activation of the synergy.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the intervention could properly shorten the activation duration of muscle synergy for those who had unusually inappropriate longer activation of synergy.	Semantic Scholar
These results imply that disordered and inadequate muscle synergy structure can be improved by proper intervention, and this study contributes to the further development of new rehabilitation methodologies.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we propose a novel type of 3D-printed soft pneumatic actuator that allows geometry-based customization of bending modalities.	Semantic Scholar
While motion in the 3-D space has been achieved for several types of soft actuators, only 2-D bending has been previously modeled and characterized within the scope of 3D-printed soft pneumatic actuators.	Semantic Scholar
We developed the first type of 3D-printed soft pneumatic actuator, which, by means of the unique feature of customizable cubes at an angle with the longitudinal axis of the structure, is capable of helical motion.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, we characterize its mechanical behavior and formulate mathematical and FEA models to validate the experimental results.	Semantic Scholar
Variation to the pattern of the inclination angle along the actuator is then demonstrated to allow for complex 3D-bending modalities and the main applications in the fields of object manipulation and wearable robotics are finally discussed.	Semantic Scholar
We present a photo-realistic training and evaluation simulator (Sim4CV) (http://www.sim4cv.org) with extensive applications across various fields of computer vision.	Semantic Scholar
Built on top of the Unreal Engine, the simulator integrates full featured physics based cars, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and animated human actors in diverse urban and suburban 3D environments.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the versatility of the simulator with two case studies: autonomous UAV-based tracking of moving objects and autonomous driving using supervised learning.	Semantic Scholar
The simulator fully integrates both several state-of-the-art tracking algorithms with a benchmark evaluation tool and a deep neural network architecture for training vehicles to drive autonomously.	Semantic Scholar
It generates synthetic photo-realistic datasets with automatic ground truth annotations to easily extend existing real-world datasets and provides extensive synthetic data variety through its ability to reconfigure synthetic worlds on the fly using an automatic world generation tool.

Despite the appearance of advanced multi-degrees of freedom (DoF) robotic hands during the past decade, prosthetic control lacks a powerful interface to facilitate all its functionalities in a manner that is acceptable for a majority of users [1].	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we explore the feasibility of using a sensing technique called force myography (FMG) as an alternative or synergist to the traditional surface electromyography (sEMG) technique as a human-machine interface (HMI) for the control of a multi-DoF prosthetic hand, bebionic 3 by Ottobock, Austin, Texas.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we present a prosthetic prototype developed for the Cybathlon 2016, a championship for racing pilots with disabilities using assistive robotic devices.	Semantic Scholar
The design of the prototype is discussed and the effect of two factors on its control is analyzed.	Semantic Scholar
These factors are 1) the impact of a multisensory approach and 2) the placement of FMG sensor strips within the prosthetic inner socket.	Semantic Scholar
Analysis is performed by comparing resulting pattern recognition accuracies.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that the use of both sensing modalities (FMG and EMG) together produced the highest pattern recognition accuracy (81.1%) for ten classes of motion (four wrist movements and six grip patterns).	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrated that FMG has the potential to be an HMI for control of upper-limb-powered prostheses.	Semantic Scholar
FMG also illustrates the potential for intuitive control through the use of pattern recognition.	Semantic Scholar
A multisensory approach could assist in increasing robustness of the HMI for prosthetic control.	Semantic Scholar

In a constantly changing world, animals must account for environmental volatility when making decisions.	Semantic Scholar
To appropriately discount older, irrelevant information, they need to learn the rate at which the environment changes.	Semantic Scholar
We develop an ideal observer model capable of inferring the present state of the environment along with its rate of change.	Semantic Scholar
Key to this computation is an update of the posterior probability of all possible change point counts.	Semantic Scholar
This computation can be challenging, as the number of possibilities grows rapidly with time.	Semantic Scholar
However, we show how the computations can be simplified in the continuum limit by a moment closure approximation.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting low-dimensional system can be used to infer the environmental state and change rate with accuracy comparable to the ideal observer.	Semantic Scholar
The approximate computations can be performed by a neural network model via a rate-correlation-based plasticity rule.	Semantic Scholar
We thus show how optimal observers accumulate evidence in changing environments and map this computation to reduced models that perform inference using plausible neural mechanisms.	Semantic Scholar
Humans can skilfully use tools and interact with the environment by adapting their movement trajectory, contact force, and impedance.	Semantic Scholar
Motivated by the human versatility, we develop here a robot controller that concurrently adapts feedforward force, impedance, and reference trajectory when interacting with an unknown environment.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the robot's reference trajectory is adapted to limit the interaction force and maintain it at a desired level, while feedforward force and impedance adaptation compensates for the interaction with the environment.	Semantic Scholar
An analysis of the interaction dynamics using Lyapunov theory yields the conditions for convergence of the closed-loop interaction mediated by this controller.	Semantic Scholar
Simulations exhibit adaptive properties similar to human motor adaptation.	Semantic Scholar
The implementation of this controller for typical interaction tasks including drilling, cutting, and haptic exploration shows that this controller can outperform conventional controllers in contact tooling.	Semantic Scholar
Types in higher-order logic (HOL) are naturally interpreted as nonempty sets.	Semantic Scholar
This intuition is reflected in the type definition rule for the HOL-based systems (including Isabelle/HOL), where a new type can be defined whenever a nonempty set is exhibited.	Semantic Scholar
However, in HOL this definition mechanism cannot be applied inside proof contexts.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a more expressive type definition rule that addresses the limitation and we prove its consistency.	Semantic Scholar
This higher expressive power opens the opportunity for a HOL tool that relativizes type-based statements to more flexible set-based variants in a principled way.	Semantic Scholar
We also address particularities of Isabelle/HOL and show how to perform the relativization in the presence of type classes.	Semantic Scholar
Most recent approaches to monocular 3D pose estimation rely on Deep Learning.	Semantic Scholar
They either train a Convolutional Neural Network to directly regress from an image to a 3D pose, which ignores the dependencies between human joints, or model these dependencies via a max-margin structured learning framework, which involves a high computational cost at inference time.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we introduce a Deep Learning regression architecture for structured prediction of 3D human pose from monocular images or 2D joint location heatmaps that relies on an overcomplete autoencoder to learn a high-dimensional latent pose representation and accounts for joint dependencies.	Semantic Scholar
We further propose an efficient Long Short-Term Memory network to enforce temporal consistency on 3D pose predictions.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance both in terms of structure preservation and prediction accuracy on standard 3D human pose estimation benchmarks.	Semantic Scholar
Recently there has been increasing attention towards analysis dictionary learning.	Semantic Scholar
In analysis dictionary learning, it is an open problem to obtain the strong sparsity-promoting solutions efficiently while simultaneously avoiding the trivial solutions of the dictionary.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, to obtain the strong sparsity-promoting solutions, we employ the ℓ1∕2 norm as a regularizer.	Semantic Scholar
The very recent study on ℓ1∕2 norm regularization theory in compressive sensing shows that its solutions can give sparser results than using the ℓ1 norm.	Semantic Scholar
We transform a complex nonconvex optimization into a number of one-dimensional minimization problems.	Semantic Scholar
Then the closed-form solutions can be obtained efficiently.	Semantic Scholar
To avoid trivial solutions, we apply manifold optimization to update the dictionary directly on the manifold satisfying the orthonormality constraint, so that the dictionary can avoid the trivial solutions well while simultaneously capturing the intrinsic properties of the dictionary.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments with synthetic and real-world data verify that the proposed algorithm for analysis dictionary learning can not only obtain strong sparsity-promoting solutions efficiently, but also learn more accurate dictionary in terms of dictionary recovery and image processing than the state-of-the-art algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Much experimental evidence suggests that during decision making, neural circuits accumulate evidence supporting alternative options.	Semantic Scholar
A computational model well describing this accumulation for choices between two options assumes that the brain integrates the log ratios of the likelihoods of the sensory inputs given the two options.	Semantic Scholar
Several models have been proposed for how neural circuits can learn these log-likelihood ratios from experience, but all of these models introduced novel and specially dedicated synaptic plasticity rules.	Semantic Scholar
Here we show that for a certain wide class of tasks, the log-likelihood ratios are approximately linearly proportional to the expected rewards for selecting actions.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, a simple model based on standard reinforcement learning rules is able to estimate the log-likelihood ratios from experience and on each trial accumulate the log-likelihood ratios associated with presented stimuli while selecting an action.	Semantic Scholar
The simulations of the model replicate experimental data on both behavior and neural activity in tasks requiring accumulation of probabilistic cues.	Semantic Scholar
Our results suggest that there is no need for the brain to support dedicated plasticity rules, as the standard mechanisms proposed to describe reinforcement learning can enable the neural circuits to perform efficient probabilistic inference.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel hybrid model that exploits the strength of discriminative classifiers along with the representation power of generative models.	Semantic Scholar
Our focus is on detecting multimodal events in time varying sequences as well as generating missing data in any of the modalities.	Semantic Scholar
Discriminative classifiers have been shown to achieve higher performances than the corresponding generative likelihood-based classifiers.	Semantic Scholar
On the other hand, generative models learn a rich informative space which allows for data generation and joint feature representation that discriminative models lack.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a new model that jointly optimizes the representation space using a hybrid energy function.	Semantic Scholar
We employ a Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) based model to learn a shared representation across multiple modalities with time varying data.	Semantic Scholar
The Conditional RBMs (CRBMs) is an extension of the RBM model that takes into account short term temporal phenomena.	Semantic Scholar
The hybrid model involves augmenting CRBMs with a discriminative component for classification.	Semantic Scholar
For these purposes we propose a novel Multimodal Discriminative CRBMs (MMDCRBMs) model.	Semantic Scholar
First, we train the MMDCRBMs model using labeled data by training each modality, followed by training a fusion layer.	Semantic Scholar
Second, we exploit the generative capability of MMDCRBMs to activate the trained model so as to generate the lower-level data corresponding to the specific label that closely matches the actual input data.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our approach on ChaLearn dataset, audio-mocap, as well as the Tower Game dataset, mocap-mocap as well as three multimodal toy datasets.	Semantic Scholar
We report classification accuracy, generation accuracy, and localization accuracy and demonstrate its superiority compared to the state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
Methods for capturing and modeling vegetation, such as trees or plants, typically distinguish between two components—branch skeleton and foliage.	Semantic Scholar
Current methods do not provide quantitatively accurate tree structure and foliage density needed for applications such as visualization, inspection, or to estimate vegetation parameters.	Semantic Scholar
This letter describes an automatic method for segmenting three-dimensional point cloud data of vegetation, acquired from commodity scanners, into its two main components: branches and leaves, by using geometric features computed directly on the point cloud.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, the specific type of vegetation considered is broadleaf trees.	Semantic Scholar
We present a data-driven approach, where a Random forest classifier is used for segmentation.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to state-of-the-art methods, the point cloud is not reduced to a set of primitives such as cylinders.	Semantic Scholar
Instead, the algorithm works at the level of the input point cloud itself, preserving quantitative accuracy in the resulting model.	Semantic Scholar
Computation of typical vegetation metrics follows naturally from this model.	Semantic Scholar
We achieve an average classification accuracy of $91\%$ on simulated data across three different species of broadleaf trees.	Semantic Scholar
Qualitative results on real data are also presented.	Semantic Scholar

Recently, technologies such as face detection, facial landmark localisation and face recognition and verification have matured enough to provide effective and efficient solutions for imagery captured under arbitrary conditions (referred to as “in-the-wild”).	Semantic Scholar
This is partially attributed to the fact that comprehensive “in-the-wild” benchmarks have been developed for face detection, landmark localisation and recognition/verification.	Semantic Scholar
A very important technology that has not been thoroughly evaluated yet is deformable face tracking “in-the-wild”.	Semantic Scholar
Until now, the performance has mainly been assessed qualitatively by visually assessing the result of a deformable face tracking technology on short videos.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we perform the first, to the best of our knowledge, thorough evaluation of state-of-the-art deformable face tracking pipelines using the recently introduced 300 VW benchmark.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate many different architectures focusing mainly on the task of on-line deformable face tracking.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we compare the following general strategies: (a) generic face detection plus generic facial landmark localisation, (b) generic model free tracking plus generic facial landmark localisation, as well as (c) hybrid approaches using state-of-the-art face detection, model free tracking and facial landmark localisation technologies.

The Sherbrooke University Water-Air VEhicle (SUWAVE) concept developed is able to takeoff and land vertically on water.	Semantic Scholar
The physical prototype consists of a wing coupled to a rotating center body that minimizes the added components with a passive takeoff maneuver.	Semantic Scholar

The final prototype has executed multiple repeatable takeoffs and has succeeded in completing full operation cycles of flying, diving, floating, and taking off.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a novel approach for exploiting structural relations to track multiple objects that may undergo long-term occlusion and abrupt motion.	Semantic Scholar
We use a model-free approach that relies only on annotations given in the first frame of the video to track all the objects online, i.e.	Semantic Scholar
without knowledge from future frames.	Semantic Scholar
We initialize a probabilistic Attributed Relational Graph (ARG) from the first frame, which is incrementally updated along the video.	Semantic Scholar
Instead of using the structural information only to evaluate the scene, the proposed approach considers it to generate new tracking hypotheses.	Semantic Scholar
In this way, our method is capable of generating relevant object candidates that are used to improve or recover the track of lost objects.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method is evaluated on several videos of table tennis, volleyball, and on the ACASVA dataset.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that our approach is very robust, flexible and able to outperform other state-of-the-art methods in sports videos that present structural patterns.	Semantic Scholar

The three most popular classes of dynamic artificial neural network models are described, with their mathematical representations and architectures followed by transformations based on their block diagrams that are convenient for stability and performance analyses.	Semantic Scholar
Classes of nonlinear dynamical systems that are universally approximated by such models are characterized, which include rigorous upper bounds on the approximation errors.	Semantic Scholar
A unified framework and linear matrix inequality-based stability conditions are described for different classes of dynamic artificial neural network models that take additional information into account such as local slope restrictions and whether the nonlinearities within the DANNs are odd.

Task-oriented training in physical environments is a leading approach for rehab training utilizing tasks that are challenging, adaptable, and meaningful.	Semantic Scholar
Although different training paradigms can be utilized in a laboratory setting, they often require expensive training equipment and personnel, limiting the number of training sessions.	Semantic Scholar
Creating an effective virtual reality (VR) training environment can greatly increase the repetition, cognitive engagement, and training variability.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, dynamic trunk control is required for the successful completion of everyday tasks.	Semantic Scholar
These tasks require coordination between the head, upper and lower trunk, and the pelvis.	Semantic Scholar
We have developed a novel robotic device, trunk support trainer (TruST) and a VR gaming environment, which allows training in a seated posture at and beyond an individual's point of stability failure using an assist-as-needed force tunnel strategy.	Semantic Scholar
The VR environment consists of challenging reaching tasks where the subject's dominant hand is used to manipulate a VR drone.	Semantic Scholar
We conducted a study that involved three groups: ten adult subjects trained using VR, ten adult subjects trained in a physical environment (PR), and ten without TruST assistance (control group) to investigate the changes in trunk kinematics.	Semantic Scholar
Our study supports the hypothesis that a single training session with TruST in both VR and PR can increase lower trunk range of motion.	Semantic Scholar
This approach may be useful for creating training variability and translating therapy in home settings.	Semantic Scholar
Availability of accurate land cover information over large areas is essential to the global environment sustainability; digital classification using medium-resolution remote sensing data would provide an effective method to generate the required land cover information.	Semantic Scholar
However, low accuracy of existing per-pixel based classification methods for medium-resolution data is a fundamental limiting factor.	Semantic Scholar
While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with deep layers have achieved unprecedented improvements in object recognition applications that rely on fine image structures, they cannot be applied directly to medium-resolution data due to lack of such fine structures.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, considering the spatial relation of a pixel to its neighborhood, we propose a new deep patch-based CNN system tailored for medium-resolution remote sensing data.	Semantic Scholar
The system is designed by incorporating distinctive characteristics of medium-resolution data; in particular, the system computes patch-based samples from multidimensional top of atmosphere reflectance data.	Semantic Scholar
With a test site from the Florida Everglades area (with a size of 771 square kilometers), the proposed new system has outperformed pixel-based neural network, pixel-based CNN and patch-based neural network by 24.36%, 24.23% and 11.52%, respectively, in overall classification accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
By combining the proposed deep CNN and the huge collection of medium-resolution remote sensing data, we believe that much more accurate land cover datasets can be produced over large areas.	Semantic Scholar
With the advent of multi-view data, multi-view learning has become an important research direction in both machine learning and data mining.	Semantic Scholar
Considering the difficulty of obtaining labeled data in many real applications, we focus on the multi-view unsupervised feature selection problem.	Semantic Scholar
Traditional approaches all characterize the similarity by fixed and pre-defined graph Laplacian in each view separately and ignore the underlying common structures across different views.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose an algorithm named Multi-view Unsupervised Feature Selection with Adaptive Similarity and View Weight (ASVW) to overcome the above mentioned problems.	Semantic Scholar
"Specifically, by leveraging the learning mechanism to characterize the common structures adaptively, we formulate the objective function by a common graph Laplacian across different views, together with the sparse <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\ell _{2,p}$</tex-math> <alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""hou-ieq1-2681670.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula>-norm constraint designed for feature selection."

We develop an efficient algorithm to address the non-smooth minimization problem and prove that the algorithm will converge.	Semantic Scholar
To validate the effectiveness of ASVW, comparisons are made with some benchmark methods on real-world datasets.	Semantic Scholar
We also evaluate our method in the real sports action recognition task.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
We study the problem of preserving user privacy in the publication of location sequences.	Semantic Scholar
Consider a database of trajectories, corresponding to movements of people, captured by their transactions when they use credit cards, RFID debit cards, or NFC (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication) compliant devices.	Semantic Scholar
We show that, if such trajectories are published exactly (by only hiding the identities of persons that followed them), one can use partial trajectory knowledge as a quasi-identifier for the remaining locations in the sequence.	Semantic Scholar
We devise four intuitive techniques, based on combinations of locations suppression and trajectories splitting, and we show that they can prevent privacy breaches while keeping published data accurate for aggregate query answering and frequent subsets data mining.	Semantic Scholar
​The field of in-hand robot manipulation of deformable objects is an open and key issue for the next-coming robots.	Semantic Scholar
The complexity of physics in a soft object and the huge variety of the deformations of its deformable shape, which can be caused when a robot grasps and manipulates it, makes necessary to develop an adaptable and agile framework for these tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Many research works have been proposed to control the manipulation tasks using a model of the manipulated object.	Semantic Scholar
Despite these techniques are precise to model the deformations, they are time consuming and, using them in real environments is almost impossible because of the large amount of objects which the robot could find.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a model-independent framework to control the movements of the fingers of the hands while the robot executes manipulation tasks with deformable objects.	Semantic Scholar
This technique is based on tactile images which are obtained as a common interface for different tactile sensors, and uses a servo-tactile control to stabilize the grasping points, avoid sliding and adapt the contacts’ configuration regarding to position and magnitude of the applied force.

Tactile images are obtained using a combination of dynamic Gaussians, which allows the creation of a common representation for tactile data given by different sensors with different technologies and resolutions.	Semantic Scholar
The framework was tested on different manipulation tasks which include complex deformations of the objects, and without using a model of them.	Semantic Scholar
YouTube, with millions of content creators, has become the preferred destination for viewing videos online.	Semantic Scholar
Through the Partner program, YouTube allows content creators to monetize their popular videos.	Semantic Scholar
Of significant importance for content creators is which meta-level features (title, tag, thumbnail, and description) are most sensitive for promoting video popularity.	Semantic Scholar
The popularity of videos also depends on the social dynamics, i.e., the interaction of the content creators (or channels) with YouTube users.	Semantic Scholar
Using real-world data consisting of about 6 million videos spread over 25 thousand channels, we empirically examine the sensitivity of YouTube meta-level features and social dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
The key meta-level features that impact the view counts of a video include: first day view count, number of subscribers, contrast of the video thumbnail, Google hits, number of keywords, video category, title length, and number of upper-case letters in the title, respectively, and illustrate that these meta-level features can be used to estimate the popularity of a video.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, optimizing the meta-level features after a video is posted increases the popularity of videos.	Semantic Scholar
In the context of social dynamics, we discover that there is a causal relationship between views to a channel and the associated number of subscribers.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, insights into the effects of scheduling and video playthrough in a channel are also provided.	Semantic Scholar
Our findings provide a useful understanding of user engagement in YouTube.	Semantic Scholar
Recent advancements of technologies in human–robot interaction (HRI) significantly expanded the applications of robots from specialized areas to our daily lives.	Semantic Scholar
However, safety is not always guaranteed in traditional robots since they are mostly made of rigid materials and structures, which cause serious injuries to humans upon physical collisions.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a soft inflatable module with self-contained tactile sensing for safe HRI applications.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed sensing module is made of a highly stretchable elastomer skin containing embedded microfluidic tactile sensors and a rigid bone structure.	Semantic Scholar
The module not only actively inflates and deflates, but also detects surface contacts using microfluidic soft pressure sensors to prevent human injuries caused by unintended collisions with robots and allowing follow-up actions to be taken, such as halting and evading.	Semantic Scholar
This letter describes the design and fabrication of the proposed inflatable sensing module, characterizes the performance of the soft sensors with different inflation levels, and evaluates the safety aspect of the module through collision tests.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we present an example of applications for the proposed system by integrating multiple modules into a robotic arm with 4 DOF.	Semantic Scholar
The arm was tested for evasion at different levels of contacts.	Semantic Scholar
The particle filter (PF) is a popular filtering algorithm in various localization problems represented by nonlinear state-space models.	Semantic Scholar
Although the PF can provide accurate localization results, it often fails in localization because of the sample impoverishment phenomenon.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a novel nonlinear filtering method that combines a PF with a robust filter, called a finite impulse response (FIR) filter, in order to accomplish accurate and reliable localization.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed filter is called the composite particle/FIR filter (CPFF).	Semantic Scholar
In the CPFF framework, the PF is the main filter used in normal situations.	Semantic Scholar
When PF failures occur, the FIR filter is used to recover the PF from failures.	Semantic Scholar
To detect PF failures, a new decision-making algorithm is proposed in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed CPFF is applied to indoor human localization using a wireless sensor network.	Semantic Scholar
The CPFF is accurate and reliable under conditions in which the pure PF typically exhibits degraded accuracy or failures in localization.	Semantic Scholar
We present the first platform-independent evaluation method for task and motion planning (TAMP).	Semantic Scholar

We propose a set of benchmark problems covering the challenging aspects of TAMP and a planner-independent specification format for these problems.	Semantic Scholar
Our objective is to better evaluate and compare TAMP planners, foster communication, and progress within the field, and lay a foundation to better understand this class of planning problems.	Semantic Scholar
The accurate human gait tracking is an important factor for various robotic applications, such as robotic walkers aiming to provide assistance to patients with different mobility impairment, social robot companions, etc.	Semantic Scholar
A context-aware robot control architecture needs constant knowledge of the user's kinematic state to assess the patient's gait status and adjust its movement properly to provide optimal assistance.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a novel human gait tracking approach that uses two particle filters (PFs) and probabilistic data association (PDA) with an interacting multiple model (IMM) scheme for a real-time selection of the appropriate motion model according to the human gait analysis and the use of the Viterbi algorithm for an augmented human gait state estimation.	Semantic Scholar
The gait state estimates also interact with the IMM as a prior information that drives the Markov sampling process, while the PDA ensures that the legs of the same person are coupled.	Semantic Scholar
The observation data in this work are provided by a laser range finder mounted on a robotic assistant walker.	Semantic Scholar
A detailed experimental validation is presented using ground truth data from a motion capture system, which was used in real experiments with elder subjects who presented various mobility impairments.	Semantic Scholar
The validation analysis regards the algorithm's accuracy, robustness to occlusions and clutter, and the gait state classification success, subject to the effect of different number of samples used in the PFs.	Semantic Scholar
The results for the elder subjects show the dynamics of the proposed algorithm to be used in a real-time application due to its efficacy to provide accurate and robust augmented human gait estimates with a small number of particles.	Semantic Scholar
We consider the problem of formally verifying an algorithm in a proof assistant and generating efficient code.	Semantic Scholar
Reasoning about correctness is best done at an abstract level, but efficiency of the generated code often requires complicated data structures.	Semantic Scholar
Data refinement has been successfully used to reconcile these conflicting requirements, but usability calls for automatic tool support.	Semantic Scholar
In the context of Isabelle/HOL, two frameworks for automating data refinement have been proposed (Lammich, in: Blazy, Paulin-Mohring, Pichardie (eds) ITP 2013, LNCS, vol 7998, Springer, Heidelberg, pp 84–99, 2013; Lochbihler, in: Blazy, Paulin-Mohring, Pichardie (eds) ITP 2013, LNCS, vol 7998, Springer, Heidelberg, pp 116–132, 2013).	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present and compare the two frameworks and their underlying ideas in depth.	Semantic Scholar
Thereby, we identify the challenges of automating data refinement, highlight the similarities and differences of the two approaches, and show their strengths and limitations both from the implementer’s and the user’s perspectives.	Semantic Scholar
A case study demonstrates how to combine both frameworks, benefiting from the strengths of each.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a novel bottom-up saliency detection algorithm from the perspective of covariance matrices on a Riemannian manifold.	Semantic Scholar
Each superpixel is described by a region covariance matrix on Riemannian Manifolds.	Semantic Scholar
We carry out a two-stage sparse coding scheme via Log-Euclidean kernels to extract salient objects efficiently.	Semantic Scholar
In the first stage, given background dictionary on image borders, sparse coding of each region covariance via Log-Euclidean kernels is performed.	Semantic Scholar
The reconstruction error on the background dictionary is regarded as the initial saliency of each superpixel.	Semantic Scholar
In the second stage, an improvement of the initial result is achieved by calculating reconstruction errors of the superpixels on foreground dictionary, which is extracted from the first stage saliency map.	Semantic Scholar
The sparse coding in the second stage is similar to the first stage, but is able to effectively highlight the salient objects uniformly from the background.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, three post-processing methods-highlight-inhibition function, context-based saliency weighting, and the graph cut-are adopted to further refine the saliency map.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on four public benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall and mean absolute error, and demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
Graph algorithm is pervasive in many applications ranging from targeted advertising to natural language processing.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, Asynchronous Graph Processing (AGP) is becoming a promising model to support graph algorithm on large-scale distributed computing platforms because it enables faster convergence speed and lower synchronization cost than the synchronous model for no barrier between iterations.	Semantic Scholar
However, existing AGP methods still suffer from poor performance for inefficient vertex state propagation.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose an effective and low-cost forward and backward sweeping execution method to accelerate state propagation for AGP, based on a key observation that states in AGP can be propagated between vertices much faster when the vertices are processed sequentially along the graph path within each round.	Semantic Scholar
Through dividing graph into paths and asynchronously processing vertices on each path in an alternative forward and backward way according to their order on this path, vertex states in our approach can be quickly propagated to other vertices and converge in a faster way with only little additional overhead.	Semantic Scholar
In order to efficiently support it over distributed platforms, we also propose a scheme to reduce the communication overhead along with a static priority ordering scheme to further improve the convergence speed.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on a cluster with 1,024 cores show that our approach achieves excellent scalability for large-scale graph algorithms and the overall execution time is reduced by at least 39.8 percent, in comparison with the most cutting-edge methods.	Semantic Scholar
Accurate velocity estimation is an important basis for robot control, but especially challenging for highly elastically driven robots.	Semantic Scholar

The increase in robotic capabilities and the number of such systems being used has resulted in opportunities for robots to work alongside humans in an increasing number of domains.	Semantic Scholar
The current robot control paradigm of one or multiple humans controlling a single robot is not scalable to domains that require large numbers of robots and is infeasible in communications constrained environments.	Semantic Scholar
Robots must autonomously plan how to accomplish missions composed of many tasks in complex and dynamic domains; however, mission planning with a large number of robots for such complex missions and domains is intractable.	Semantic Scholar
Coalition formation can manage planning problem complexity by allocating the best possible team of robots for each task.	Semantic Scholar
A limitation is that simply allocating the best possible team does not guarantee an executable plan can be formulated.	Semantic Scholar
However, coupling coalition formation with planning creates novel, domain-independent tools resulting in the best possible teams executing the best possible plans for robots acting in complex domains.	Semantic Scholar
Autonomous vehicles have found wide-ranging adoption in aerospace, terrestrial as well as marine use.	Semantic Scholar
These systems often operate in uncertain environments and in the presence of noisy sensors, and use machine learning and statistical sensor fusion algorithms to form an internal model of the world that is inherently probabilistic.	Semantic Scholar
Autonomous vehicles need to operate using this uncertain world-model, and hence, their correctness cannot be deterministically specified.	Semantic Scholar
Even once probabilistic correctness is specified, proving that an autonomous vehicle will operate correctly is a challenging problem.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a correct-by-synthesis approach to autonomous vehicle control.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a probabilistic extension of temporal logic, named Chance Constrained Temporal Logic (C2TL), that can be used to specify correctness requirements in presence of uncertainty.	Semantic Scholar
C2TL extends temporal logic by including chance constraints as predicates in the formula which allows modeling of perception uncertainty while retaining its ease of reasoning.	Semantic Scholar
We present a novel automated synthesis technique that compiles C2TL specification into mixed integer constraints, and uses second-order (quadratic) cone programming to synthesize optimal control of autonomous vehicles subject to the C2TL specification.	Semantic Scholar
We also present a risk distribution approach that enables synthesis of plans with lower cost without increasing the overall risk.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a diverse set of illustrative examples.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a hybrid tele-manipulation system, comprising of a sensorized 3-D-printed soft robotic gripper and a soft fabric-based haptic glove that aim at improving grasping manipulation and providing sensing feedback to the operators.	Semantic Scholar
The flexible 3-D-printed soft robotic gripper broadens what a robotic gripper can do, especially for grasping tasks where delicate objects, such as glassware, are involved.	Semantic Scholar
It consists of four pneumatic finger actuators, casings with through hole for housing the actuators, and adjustable base.	Semantic Scholar
The grasping length and width can be configured easily to suit a variety of objects.	Semantic Scholar
The soft haptic glove is equipped with flex sensors and soft pneumatic haptic actuator, which enables the users to control the grasping, to determine whether the grasp is successful, and to identify the grasped object shape.	Semantic Scholar
The fabric-based soft pneumatic haptic actuator can simulate haptic perception by producing force feedback to the users.	Semantic Scholar
Both the soft pneumatic finger actuator and haptic actuator involve simple fabrication technique, namely 3-D-printed approach and fabric-based approach, respectively, which reduce fabrication complexity as compared to the steps involved in a traditional silicone-based approach.	Semantic Scholar
The sensorized soft robotic gripper is capable of picking up and holding a wide variety of objects in this study, ranging from lightweight delicate object weighing less than 50 g to objects weighing 1100 g. The soft haptic actuator can produce forces of up to 2.1 N, which is more than the minimum force of 1.5 N needed to stimulate haptic perception.	Semantic Scholar
The subjects are able to differentiate the two objects with significant shape differences in the pilot test.	Semantic Scholar
Compared to the existing soft grippers, this is the first soft sensorized 3-D-printed gripper, coupled with a soft fabric-based haptic glove that has the potential to improve the robotic grasping manipulation by introducing haptic feedback to the users.	Semantic Scholar
Robotics have long sought an actuation technology comparable to or as capable as biological muscle tissue.	Semantic Scholar
Natural muscles exhibit a high power-to-weight ratio, inherent compliance and damping, fast action, and a high dynamic range.	Semantic Scholar
They also produce joint displacements and forces without the need for gearing or additional hardware.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, supercoiled commercially available polymer threads (sewing thread or nylon fishing lines) have been used to create significant mechanical power in a muscle-like form factor.	Semantic Scholar
Heating and cooling the polymer threads causes contraction and expansion, which can be utilized for actuation.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we describe the working principle of supercoiled polymer (SCP) actuation and explore the controllability and properties of these threads.	Semantic Scholar
We show that under appropriate environmental conditions, the threads are suitable as a building block for a controllable artificial muscle.	Semantic Scholar
We leverage off-the-shelf silver-coated threads to enable rapid electrical heating while the low thermal mass allows for rapid cooling.	Semantic Scholar
We utilize both thermal and thermomechanical models for feed-forward and feedback control.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting SCP actuator regulates to desired force levels in as little as 28 ms.	Semantic Scholar
Together with its inherent stiffness and damping, this is sufficient for a position controller to execute large step movements in under 100 ms.	Semantic Scholar
This controllability, high performance, the mechanical properties, and the extremely low material cost are indicative of a viable artificial muscle.	Semantic Scholar
This paper is concerned with understanding synthesis of electric signals in the neural system based on making pairwise comparisons.	Semantic Scholar
Fundamentally, every person and every animal are born with the talent to compare stimuli from things that share properties in space or over time.	Semantic Scholar
Comparisons always need experience to distinguish among things.	Semantic Scholar
Pairwise comparisons are numerically reciprocal.	Semantic Scholar
If a value is assigned to the larger of two elements that have a given property when compared with the smaller one, then the smaller has the reciprocal of that value when compared with the larger.	Semantic Scholar
Because making comparisons requires the reciprocal property, we need mathematics that can cope with division.	Semantic Scholar
There are four division algebras that would allow us to use our reciprocals arising from comparisons: The real numbers, the complex numbers, the non-commutative quaternions and the non-associative octonions.	Semantic Scholar
Rather than inferring function as from electric flow in a network, in this paper we infer the flow from function.	Semantic Scholar
Neurons fire in response to stimuli and their firings vary relative to the intensities of the stimuli.	Semantic Scholar
We believe neurons use some kind of pairwise comparison mechanism to determine when to fire based on the stimuli they receive.	Semantic Scholar
The ideas we develop here about flows are used to deduce how a system based on this kind of firing determination works and can be described.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore the firing of neurons requires continuous comparisons.	Semantic Scholar
To develop a formula describing the output of these pairwise comparisons requires solving Fredholm's equation of the second kind which is satisfied if and only if a simple functional equation has solutions.	Semantic Scholar
The Fourier transform of the real solution of this equation leads to inverse square laws like those that are common in physics.	Semantic Scholar
The Fourier transform applied to a complex valued solution leads to Dirac type of firings.	Semantic Scholar
Such firings are dense in the very general fields of functions known as Sobolev spaces and thus can be used to represent the very diverse phenomena in and around us.	Semantic Scholar
The non-commutative solution in quaternions can be interpreted as rotations in space.	Semantic Scholar
The also non-commutative and non-associative solution in octonions has yet to be adequately interpreted outside physics.	Semantic Scholar
Data-parameterized systems model systems with finite control over an infinite data domain.	Semantic Scholar
VLTL is an extension of LTL that uses variables in order to specify properties of computations over infinite data, and as such, VLTL is suitable for specifying properties of data-parameterized systems.	Semantic Scholar
We present alternating variable Büchi word automata (AVBWs), a new model of automata over infinite alphabets, capable of modeling a significant fragment of VLTL.	Semantic Scholar
While alternating and non-deterministic Büchi automata over finite alphabets have the same expressive power, we show that this is not the case for infinite data domains, as we prove that AVBWs are strictly stronger than the previously defined non-deterministic variable Büchi word automata (NVBWs).	Semantic Scholar
However, while the emptiness problem is easy for NVBWs, it is undecidable for AVBWs.	Semantic Scholar
We present an algorithm for translating AVBWs to NVBWs in cases where such a translation is possible.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, we characterize the structure of AVBWs that can be translated to NVBWs with our algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
We then rely on the natural iterative behavior of our translation algorithm to describe a bounded model-checking procedure for the logic that we consider.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we present several fragments of the logic that can be expressed by NVBWs, as well as a fragment that cannot be expressed by NVBWs, yet whose satisfiability is decidable.	Semantic Scholar

Feature-based and holistic methods present two fundamentally different approaches to relative-pose estimation from pairs of camera images.	Semantic Scholar
Until now, there has been a lack of direct comparisons between these methods in the literature.	Semantic Scholar
This makes it difficult to evaluate their relative merits for their many applications in mobile robotics.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we compare a selection of such methods in the context of an autonomous domestic cleaning robot.	Semantic Scholar
We find that the holistic Min-Warping method gives good and fast results.	Semantic Scholar
Some of the feature-based methods can provide excellent and robust results, but at much slower speeds.	Semantic Scholar
Other such methods also achieve high speeds, but at reduced robustness to illumination changes.	Semantic Scholar
We also provide novel image databases and supporting data for public use.	Semantic Scholar
We present a distributed control algorithm simultaneously solving both the stochastic target assignment and optimal motion control for large-scale swarms to achieve complex formation shapes.	Semantic Scholar
Our probabilistic swarm guidance using inhomogeneous Markov chains (PSG–IMC) algorithm adopts a Eulerian density-control framework, under which the physical space is partitioned into multiple bins and the swarm's density distribution over each bin is controlled in a probabilistic fashion to efficiently handle loss or the addition of agents.	Semantic Scholar
We assume that the number of agents is much larger than the number of bins and that each agent knows in which bin it is located, the desired formation shape, and the objective function and motion constraints.	Semantic Scholar
PSG–IMC determines the bin-to-bin transition probabilities of each agent using a time IMC.	Semantic Scholar
These time-varying Markov matrices are computed by each agent in real time using the feedback from the current swarm distribution, which is estimated in a distributed manner.	Semantic Scholar
The PSG–IMC algorithm minimizes the expected cost of transitions per time instant that are required to achieve and maintain the desired formation shape, even if agents are added to or removed from the swarm.	Semantic Scholar
PSG–IMC scales well with a large number of agents and complex formation shapes and can also be adapted for area exploration applications.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed swarm guidance algorithm by using numerical simulations and hardware experiments with multiple quadrotors.	Semantic Scholar
Knowledge graph (KG) embedding is to embed components of a KG including entities and relations into continuous vector spaces, so as to simplify the manipulation while preserving the inherent structure of the KG.	Semantic Scholar
It can benefit a variety of downstream tasks such as KG completion and relation extraction, and hence has quickly gained massive attention.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we provide a systematic review of existing techniques, including not only the state-of-the-arts but also those with latest trends.	Semantic Scholar
Particularly, we make the review based on the type of information used in the embedding task.	Semantic Scholar
Techniques that conduct embedding using only facts observed in the KG are first introduced.	Semantic Scholar
We describe the overall framework, specific model design, typical training procedures, as well as pros and cons of such techniques.	Semantic Scholar
After that, we discuss techniques that further incorporate additional information besides facts.	Semantic Scholar
We focus specifically on the use of entity types, relation paths, textual descriptions, and logical rules.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we briefly introduce how KG embedding can be applied to and benefit a wide variety of downstream tasks such as KG completion, relation extraction, question answering, and so forth.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents the depth control of an autonomous micro diving agent called autonomous diving agent (ADA).	Semantic Scholar
ADA consists of off-the-shelf components and features open-source hardware and firmware.	Semantic Scholar
It can be deployed as a testbed for depth controllers, as well as a mobile sensor platform for research or in industrial tanks.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce a control law that is based on the feedback linearization method and enhanced by an adaptive fuzzy algorithm to cope with modeling inaccuracies.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed depth controller is computationally light enough to run on ADAs embedded hardware.	Semantic Scholar
In experiments performed in a wave tank, the adaptive fuzzy scheme shows the ability to deal with both depth regulation and depth profile tracking.	Semantic Scholar
ADA is even able to hold on to dynamic isobars despite external disturbances.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate that under the influence of waves, ADA describes orbital motions similar to water particles.	Semantic Scholar
Additive manufacturing (AM) is a process to produce three-dimensional parts with complex and free-form geometries layer by layer from computer-aided-design models.	Semantic Scholar
However, real-time quality control is the main challenge that hampers the wide adoption of AM.	Semantic Scholar
Advancements in sensing systems facilitate AM monitoring and control.	Semantic Scholar
Realizing full potentials of sensing data for AM quality control depends to a great extent on effective analytical methods and tools that will handle complicated imaging data, and extract pertinent information about defect conditions and process dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
This letter considers the optimal control problem for AM parts whose layerwise defect states can be monitored using advanced sensing systems.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we formulate the in situ AM control problem as a Markov decision process and utilize the layerwise imaging data to find an optimal control policy.	Semantic Scholar
We take into account the stochastic uncertainty in the variations of layerwise defects and aim at mitigating the defects before they reach the nonrecoverable stage.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the model is used to derive an optimal control policy by utilizing the defect-state signals estimated from layerwise images in a metal AM application.	Semantic Scholar

The lower limbs of the human body are responsible for human locomotion and maintaining a good quality of life.	Semantic Scholar
However, there are many instances of muscle fatigue or injuries caused by stressful work environments, aging, and work that involves walking a long distance.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, there is a need for an assistive suit for walking that can unload muscle efforts during walking and reduce the chances of lower-limb muscle fatigue.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we discuss the development of a lightweight and wearable augmented walking suit (AWS) using pneumatic gel muscle and its actuation control the using lower limb pose detection mechanism considering the human gait cycle.	Semantic Scholar
The objective of this assistive suit is to reduce the required muscle effort of the posterior and anterior muscles during the swing phase of the gait cycle, thereby making it easier to move forward.	Semantic Scholar
To evaluate the effects of the AWS, an experiment was conducted to record the surface EMG (sEMG) of eight primary lower limb muscles of seven subjects for two levels of assistive air pressure.	Semantic Scholar
The evaluation was done based on the sEMG signal envelope and the statistical difference in the average percentage of maximum voluntary contraction of the measured muscles.	Semantic Scholar
In our result, we found that all muscles showed a statistically significant reduction or no change in muscle activity while wearing the AWS as compared with when the AWS was not worn.	Semantic Scholar
Closed-loop production lines with constant number of carriers are widely encountered in manufacturing systems.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we introduce an iteration method to study the key performance indicator (KPI) of closed-loop production lines with geometric reliability machines.	Semantic Scholar
First, analysis of two-machine loops is carried out to derive the distribution of carriers in the system.	Semantic Scholar
Then the larger loop systems are decomposed into multiple smaller loop lines hierarchically until two-machine loops are obtained.	Semantic Scholar
Through an iteration procedure, the interactions between the small loops are estimated to adjust the carrier distributions using the two-machine formula.	Semantic Scholar
When the procedure converges, the system KPI, i.e., line production rate, can be estimated.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown that the procedure is convergent and results in high accuracy of estimation.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, an application study at an automotive body shop is presented.	Semantic Scholar
Industry demands flexible robots that are able to accomplish different tasks at different locations such as navigation and mobile manipulation.	Semantic Scholar
Operators often require mobile robots operating on factory floors to follow definite and predictable behaviors.	Semantic Scholar
This becomes particularly important when a robot shares the workspace with other moving entities.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a system for robot navigation that exploits previous experiences to generate predictable behaviors that meet user’s preferences.	Semantic Scholar
Preferences are not explicitly formulated but implicitly extracted from robot experiences and automatically considered to plan paths for the successive tasks without requiring experts to hard-code rules or strategies.	Semantic Scholar
Our system aims at accomplishing navigation behaviors that follow user’s preferences also to avoid dynamic obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
We achieve this by considering a probabilistic approach for modeling uncertain trajectories of the moving entities that share the workspace with the robot.	Semantic Scholar
We implemented and thoroughly tested our system both in simulation and on a real mobile robot.	Semantic Scholar
The extensive experiments presented in this paper demonstrate that our approach allows a robot for successfully navigating while performing predictable behaviors and meeting user’s preferences.	Semantic Scholar
This paper describes the TPTP problem library and associated infrastructure, from its use of Clause Normal Form (CNF), via the First-Order Form (FOF) and Typed First-order Form (TFF), through to the monomorphic Typed Higher-order Form (TH0).	Semantic Scholar
TPTP v6.4.0 was the last release prior to the introduction of the polymorphic Typed Higher-order Form, and thus serves as the exemplar.	Semantic Scholar
This paper summarizes the aims and history of the TPTP, documents its growth up to v6.4.0, reviews the structure and contents of TPTP problems, and gives an overview of TPTP-related infrastructure.	Semantic Scholar
This letter proposes a low-level visual navigation algorithm to improve visual localization of a mobile robot.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm, based on artificial potential fields, associates each feature in the current image frame with an attractive or neutral potential energy, with the objective of generating a control action that drives the vehicle towards the goal, while still favoring feature rich areas within a local scope, thus improving the localization performance.	Semantic Scholar
One key property of the proposed method is that it does not rely on mapping, and therefore it is a lightweight solution that can be deployed on miniaturized aerial robots, in which memory and computational power are major constraints.	Semantic Scholar
Simulations and real experimental results using a mini quadrotor equipped with a downward looking camera demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively drive the vehicle to a designated goal through a path that prevents localization failure.	Semantic Scholar
This paper focuses on a new type of taxonomy called supervised taxonomy (ST).	Semantic Scholar
Supervised taxonomies are generated considering background information concerning class labels in addition to distance metrics, and are capable of capturing class-uniform regions in a dataset.	Semantic Scholar
A hierarchical, agglomerative clustering algorithm, called STAXAC that generates STs is proposed and its properties are analyzed.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results are presented that show that STAXAC produces purer taxonomies than the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm—a very popular taxonomy generation algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
We introduced novel measures and algorithms that assess classification complexity, class modality, and show that STs can be used as the main input of an effective data-editing tool to enhance the accuracy of k-nearest neighbor classifiers.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrated in our experimental evaluation that assessing the classification complexity of a ST provides us with a good estimate of the difficulty of the classification problem at hand.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, a class modality discovery tool (CMD) has been provided that—based on a domain expert's notion of what constitutes a “note-worthy” subclass—determines if specific classes in the dataset are zero-modal, unimodal, and multi-modal.	Semantic Scholar
A completeness threshold is required to guarantee the completeness of planning as satisfiability, and bounded model checking of safety properties.	Semantic Scholar
We investigate completeness thresholds related to the diameter of the underlying transition system.	Semantic Scholar
A valid threshold, the diameter is the maximum element in the set of lengths of all shortest paths between pairs of states.	Semantic Scholar
The diameter is not calculated exactly in our setting, where the transition system is succinctly described using a (propositionally) factored representation.	Semantic Scholar
Rather, an upper bound on the diameter is calculated compositionally, by bounding the diameters of small abstract subsystems, and then composing those.	Semantic Scholar
We describe our formal verification in HOL4 of compositional algorithms for computing a relatively tight upper bound on the system diameter.	Semantic Scholar
Existing compositional algorithms are characterised in terms of the problem structures they exploit, including acyclicity in state-variable dependencies, and acyclicity in the state space.	Semantic Scholar
Such algorithms are further distinguished by: (1) whether the bound calculated for abstractions is the diameter, sublist diameter or recurrence diameter, and (2) the “direction” of traversal of the compositional structure, either top-down or bottom-up.	Semantic Scholar
As a supplement, we publish our library—now over 14k lines—of HOL4 proof scripts about transition systems.	Semantic Scholar
That shall be of use to future related mechanisation efforts, and is carefully designed for compatibility with hybrid systems.	Semantic Scholar
Teleoperation in robotic embodiments allows operators to perform and program manipulation tasks with better accuracy, dexterity, and visualization than what is possible with traditional human–robot interaction paradigms.	Semantic Scholar
However, the perception of cues (e.g., egocentric distances) relevant to task execution, is known to be distorted in virtual environments due to many factors, which can be grouped into technical, human, and methodological categories.	Semantic Scholar
This phenomenon becomes more pronounced in a low-cost/encumbrance setup, where the dynamic environment is captured with color and depth (RGB-D) cameras and presented in a virtual environment.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, the effects of augmented reality (AR) are evaluated as a tool to deliver additional information, which helps in overcoming the differences in perception between telepresence and actual presence.	Semantic Scholar
The AR feedback is used to improve the embodiment illusion and to guide the operator during task execution.	Semantic Scholar
The AR setup, comprising an RGB-D camera and a head-mounted display, is integrated with the Baxter robot and evaluated by involving 22 participants in an experiment while they execute a pick-and-place task, taking into account their expertise in AR/virtual reality (VR) and gaming.	Semantic Scholar
The use of AR results in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the task performance, besides significantly reducing the effect of the differences in skillfulness between the participants.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, it is found that the sense of presence and embodiment for the participant is positively affected by different types of AR.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we aim at tackling the problem of user clustering in the context of their published short text streams.	Semantic Scholar
Clustering users by short text streams is more challenging than in the case of long documents associated with them as it is difficult to track users’ dynamic interests in streaming sparse data.	Semantic Scholar
To obtain better user clustering performance, we propose two user collaborative interest tracking models that aim at tracking changes of each user's dynamic topic distributions in collaboration with their followees’ dynamic topic distributions, based both on the content of current short texts and the previously estimated distributions.	Semantic Scholar
Our models can be either short-term or long-term dependency topic models.	Semantic Scholar
Short-term dependency model collaboratively tracks users’ interests based on users’ topic distributions at the previous time period only, whereas long-term dependency model collaboratively tracks users’ interests based on users’ topic distributions at multiple time periods in the past.	Semantic Scholar
We also propose two collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithms for collaboratively inferring users’ dynamic interests for their clustering in our short-term and long-term dependency topic models, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our proposed models via a benchmark dataset consisting of Twitter users and their tweets.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed models that integrate both users’ and their collaborative interests for user clustering by short text streams.	Semantic Scholar
Extending the maneuverability of multirotors promises to yield a considerable increase in their scope of applications, such as carrying out more challenging inspection tasks and generating complex, uninterrupted movements of an attached camera.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we address the promise of multirotor maneuverability by presenting Voliro, a novel aerial platform that combines the advantages of existing multirotor systems with the agility of vehicles having omniorientational controllability.	Semantic Scholar
In other words, Voliro can fly in any direction while maintaining an arbitrary orientation.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a distributed control policy to achieve rendezvous by a set of robots even when some robots in the system do not follow the prescribed policy.	Semantic Scholar
These nonconforming robots correspond to faults in the multirobot system, and our control policy is thus a fault-tolerant policy.	Semantic Scholar
Each robot has a limited sensing range and is able to directly estimate the state of only those robots within that sensing range, which induces a network topology for the multirobot system.	Semantic Scholar
We assume that it is not possible for the fault-free robots to identify the faulty robots, and thus our approach is robust even to undetected faults in the system.	Semantic Scholar
The main contribution of this paper is a fault-tolerant distributed control algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to consensus under certain reasonable connectivity conditions.	Semantic Scholar
We first present a general algorithm that exploits the notion of a Tverberg partition of a point set in $\mathbb {R}^d$, and give a proof of convergence.	Semantic Scholar
We then provide three instantiations of this algorithm, based on three different sensing models.	Semantic Scholar
For each case, we analyze performance via extensive simulations.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness and performance of our algorithms on real platforms are demonstrated through experiments on a multirobot testbed.	Semantic Scholar
For a domain adaptation learning problem, how to minimize the distribution mismatch between different domains is one of key challenges.	Semantic Scholar
In real applications, it is reasonable to obtain an optimal latent space for both domains so as to reduce the domain distribution discrepancy as much as possible.	Semantic Scholar
We therefore propose in this paper a Robust Latent Regression (RLR) framework with discriminative regularization by uncovering a compact and more informative latent space as well as leveraging the source domain knowledge, which learns a discriminative representation of domain data by considering the recognition task in the procedure of domain adaptation learning.	Semantic Scholar
On the one hand, to leverage the prior information in the source domain, RLR incorporates both the source and target classification loss functions as parts of its objective function, and simultaneously trains these two classifiers by encoding the common components of the classifier models as a low-rank regularization term, thus exploiting the discriminative information shared by different domains.	Semantic Scholar
On the other hand, to guarantee that the latent space is more compact and discriminative, the intrinsic geometric structure of data, and the local and global structural consistencies over labels are exploited simultaneously and incorporated into RLR.	Semantic Scholar
Lastly, to make our algorithm robust to the outliers and noise, we additionally introduce the l2,1-norm into the loss function.	Semantic Scholar
To solve the proposed problem, an effective iterative algorithm is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments are conducted on several visual datasets and the results show that the proposed approach achieves outstanding performance for almost all learning tasks compared with several representative algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
This paper studies the problem of autonomous data collection where an underwater vehicle is required to reach several target regions within a specified time limit.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach takes into account the vehicle dynamics, the time-varying ocean currents, and the obstacles in the region in order to effectively plan a collision-free and dynamically feasible trajectory whose time duration does not exceed the time limit.	Semantic Scholar
When the time limit makes it impossible to reach every target, the approach seeks to reduce the penalty accrued by the target regions that are not visited.	Semantic Scholar
The approach combines sampling-based motion planning with constraint-based solvers.	Semantic Scholar
In fact, a constraint-based solver searches a navigation roadmap to compute bounded tours which minimize the accrued penalty.	Semantic Scholar
Sampling-based motion planning is then used to expand a motion tree along these tours.	Semantic Scholar
Unsuccessful tour expansions are penalized to promote exploration of alternative tours.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation and field experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the approach in planning collision-free and dynamically feasible trajectories that reduce the accrued penalty.	Semantic Scholar
We speed up the solution of the mobile sequential recommendation (MSR) problem that requires searching optimal routes for empty taxi cabs through mining massive taxi GPS data.	Semantic Scholar
We develop new methods that combine parallel computing and the simulated annealing with novel global and local searches.	Semantic Scholar
While existing approaches usually involve costly offline algorithms and methodical pruning of the search space, our new methods provide direct real-time search for the optimal route without the offline preprocessing.	Semantic Scholar
Our methods significantly reduce computational time for the high dimensional MSR problems from days to seconds based on the real-world data as well as the synthetic ones.	Semantic Scholar
We efficiently provide solutions to MSR problems with thousands of pick-up points without offline training, compared to the published record of 25 pick-up points.	Semantic Scholar
With the spread of wearable devices and head mounted cameras, a wide range of application requiring precise user localization is now possible.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we propose to treat the problem of obtaining the user position with respect to a known environment as a video registration problem.	Semantic Scholar
Video registration, i.e.	Semantic Scholar
the task of aligning an input video sequence to a pre-built 3D model, relies on a matching process of local keypoints extracted on the query sequence to a 3D point cloud.	Semantic Scholar
The overall registration performance is strictly tied to the actual quality of this 2D-3D matching, and can degrade if environmental conditions such as steep changes in lighting like the ones between day and night occur.	Semantic Scholar
To effectively register an egocentric video sequence under these conditions, we propose to tackle the source of the problem: the matching process.	Semantic Scholar
To overcome the shortcomings of standard matching techniques, we introduce a novel embedding space that allows us to obtain robust matches by jointly taking into account local descriptors, their spatial arrangement and their temporal robustness.	Semantic Scholar
The proposal is evaluated using unconstrained egocentric video sequences both in terms of matching quality and resulting registration performance using different 3D models of historical landmarks.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that the proposed method can outperform state of the art registration algorithms, in particular when dealing with the challenges of night and day sequences.	Semantic Scholar
Collective inference has attracted considerable attention in the last decade, where the response variables within a group of instances are correlated and should be inferred collectively, instead of independently.	Semantic Scholar
Previous works on collective inference mainly focus on exploiting the autocorrelation among instances in a  static network during the inference process.	Semantic Scholar
There are also approaches on time series prediction, which mainly exploit the autocorrelation within an instance at different time points during the inference process.	Semantic Scholar
However, in many real-world applications, the response variables of related instances can co-evolve over time and their evolutions are not following a static correlation across time, but are following an internal life cycle.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study the problem of collective evolution inference, where the goal is to predict the values of the response variables for a group of related instances at the end of their life cycles.	Semantic Scholar
This problem is extremely important for various applications, e.g., predicting fund-raising results in crowd-funding and predicting gene-expression levels in bioinformatics.	Semantic Scholar
This problem is also highly challenging because different instances in the network can co-evolve over time and they can be at different stages of their life cycles and thus have different evolving patterns.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the instances in collective evolution inference problems are usually connected through heterogeneous information networks (HINs for short), which involve complex relationships among the instances interconnected by multiple types of links.	Semantic Scholar
We propose an approach, called NetCycle+, by incorporating information from both the correlation among related instances and their life cycles.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, in order to study the deep dependencies between nodes in the network, we extend the graph convolution model into our algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
We compared our approach with existing methods of collective inference and time series analysis on two real-world networks.	Semantic Scholar
The results demonstrate that our proposed approach can improve the inference performance by considering the autocorrelation through networks and the life cycles of the instances.	Semantic Scholar
Cheap ubiquitous computing enables the collection of massive amounts of personal data in a wide variety of domains.	Semantic Scholar
Many organizations aim to share such data while obscuring features that could disclose personally identifiable information.	Semantic Scholar
Much of this data exhibits weak structure (e.g., text), such that machine learning approaches have been developed to detect and remove identifiers from it.	Semantic Scholar
While learning is never perfect, and relying on such approaches to sanitize data can leak sensitive information, a small risk is often acceptable.	Semantic Scholar
Our goal is to balance the value of published data and the risk of an adversary discovering leaked identifiers.	Semantic Scholar
We model data sanitization as a game between 1) a publisher who chooses a set of classifiers to apply to data and publishes only instances predicted as non-sensitive and 2) an attacker who combines machine learning and manual inspection to uncover leaked identifying information.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce a fast iterative greedy algorithm for the publisher that ensures a low utility for a resource-limited adversary.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, using five text data sets we illustrate that our algorithm leaves virtually no automatically identifiable sensitive instances for a state-of-the-art learning algorithm, while sharing over 93 percent of the original data, and completes after at most five iterations.	Semantic Scholar
The purpose of supervised learning with temporal encoding for spiking neurons is to make the neurons emit a specific spike train encoded by precise firing times of spikes.	Semantic Scholar
The gradient-descent-based (GDB) learning methods are widely used and verified in the current research.	Semantic Scholar
Although the existing GDB multi-spike learning (or spike sequence learning) methods have good performance, they work in an offline manner and still have some limitations.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes an online GDB spike sequence learning method for spiking neurons that is based on the online adjustment mechanism of real biological neuron synapses.	Semantic Scholar
The method constructs error function and calculates the adjustment of synaptic weights as soon as the neurons emit a spike during their running process.	Semantic Scholar
We analyze and synthesize desired and actual output spikes to select appropriate input spikes in the calculation of weight adjustment in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results show that our method obviously improves learning performance compared with the offline learning manner and has certain advantage on learning accuracy compared with other learning methods.	Semantic Scholar
Stronger learning ability determines that the method has large pattern storage capacity.	Semantic Scholar
Friction plays a key role in manipulating objects.	Semantic Scholar
Most of what we do with our hands, and the most of what robots do with their grippers, is based on the ability to control frictional forces.	Semantic Scholar
This letter aims to better understand the variability and predictability of planar friction.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we focus on the analysis of a recent dataset on planar pushing by [K.-T. Yu, M. Bauza, N. Fazeli, and A.

devised to create a data-driven footprint of planar friction.	Semantic Scholar
We show in this letter how we can explain a significant fraction of the observed unconventional phenomena, e.g., stochasticity and multimodality, by combining the effects of material nonhomogeneity, anisotropy of friction and biases due to data collection dynamics, hinting that the variability is explainable but inevitable in practice.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce an anisotropic friction model and conduct simulation experiments comparing with more standard isotropic friction models.	Semantic Scholar
The anisotropic friction between the object and supporting surface results in convergence of initial condition during the automated data collection.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical results confirm that the anisotropic friction model explains the bias in the dataset and the apparent stochasticity in the outcome of a push.	Semantic Scholar
The fact that the data collection process itself can originate biases in the collected datasets, resulting in deterioration of trained models, calls attention to the data collection dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
Many complex systems are composed of coupled networks through different layers, where each layer represents one of many possible types of interactions.	Semantic Scholar
A fundamental question is how to extract communities in multi-layer networks.	Semantic Scholar
The current algorithms either collapses multi-layer networks into a single-layer network or extends the algorithms for single-layer networks by using consensus clustering.	Semantic Scholar
However, these approaches have been criticized for ignoring the connection among various layers, thereby resulting in low accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
To attack this problem, a quantitative function (multi-layer modularity density) is proposed for community detection in multi-layer networks.	Semantic Scholar
"Afterward, we prove that the trace optimization of multi-layer modularity density is equivalent to the objective functions of algorithms, such as kernel <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$K$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""ma-ieq1-2832205.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula>-means, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), spectral clustering and multi-view clustering, for multi-layer networks, which serves as the theoretical foundation for designing algorithms for community detection."

Semantic Scholar
Unlike the traditional semi-supervised algorithms, the partial supervision is integrated into the objective of the S2-jNMF algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, through extensive experiments on both artificial and real world networks, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for community detection in multi-layer networks.	Semantic Scholar
Massive graph data sets are pervasive in contemporary application domains.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, graph database systems are becoming increasingly important.	Semantic Scholar
In the experimental study of these systems, it is vital that the research community has shared solutions for the generation of database instances and query workloads having predictable and controllable properties.	Semantic Scholar

Control systems for powered prosthetic legs typically divide the gait cycle into several periods with distinct controllers, resulting in dozens of control parameters that must be tuned across users and activities.	Semantic Scholar
To address this challenge, this paper presents a control approach that unifies the gait cycle of a powered knee–ankle prosthesis using a continuous, user-synchronized sense of phase.	Semantic Scholar
Virtual constraints characterize the desired periodic joint trajectories as functions of a phase variable across the entire stride.	Semantic Scholar
The phase variable is computed from residual thigh motion, giving the amputee control over the timing of the prosthetic joint patterns.	Semantic Scholar
"This continuous sense of phase enabled three transfemoral amputee subjects to walk at speeds from 0.67 to 1.21 m/s and slopes from <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$-2.5^{\circ }$</tex-math></inline-formula> to +9.0<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$^{\circ }$</tex-math></inline-formula>."	Semantic Scholar
Virtual constraints based on task-specific kinematics facilitated normative adjustments in joint work across walking speeds.	Semantic Scholar
A fixed set of control gains generalized across these activities and users, which minimized the configuration time of the prosthesis.	Semantic Scholar
This paper is concerned with the firing of many neurons and the synthesis of these firings to develop functions and their transforms which relate chemical and electrical phenomena to the physical world.	Semantic Scholar
The density of such functions in the most general spaces that we encounter allows us to use linear combinations of them to approximate arbitrarily close to any phenomenon we encounter, imagine or think about.	Semantic Scholar
Absence of the technology needed to represent all the senses and the mathematical difficulty of making geometric representations of functions of a complex and of more general division algebra variables make it difficult to validate the mathematical outcome of this approach to neural firings.	Semantic Scholar
But we think that this problem will be solved in the not-too-distant future when at least the senses of smell, taste and touch would have been so mathematized that it is possible to instill these qualities in robots in some fashion.	Semantic Scholar
The retinal images with lesions, exudates, non-uniformed illuminations and pathological artifacts have intrinsic problems such as the absence of thin vessels and false vessels detection.	Semantic Scholar
To solve these problems, we propose a novel algorithm which involves separation of background images to minimize the influence of noise, non-uniformed illuminations and lesions.	Semantic Scholar
We develop two different strategies to segment thin and thick blood vessels.	Semantic Scholar
Thin blood vessels are identified by taking benefits of local phasepreserving denoising, line detection, local normalization and maximum entropy thresholding.	Semantic Scholar
To remove noise and preserve detailed blood vessels information, phase-preserving denoising technique is used.	Semantic Scholar
The technology takes an advantage of log-Gabor wavelet responses in the complex domain to preserve the phase information of the image.	Semantic Scholar
Thick vessels are extracted and binarized via maximum entropy thresholding.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on four popular databases (DRIVE, STARE, CHASE_ DB1, HRF).	Semantic Scholar
The results demonstrate that the proposed segmentation process is automatic, accurate and computationally efficient.	Semantic Scholar

Recommendation has provoked vast amount of attention and research in recent decades.	Semantic Scholar
Most previous works employ matrix factorization techniques to learn the latent factors of users and items.	Semantic Scholar
And many subsequent works consider external information, e.g., social relationships of users and items' attributions, to improve the recommendation performance under the matrix factorization framework.	Semantic Scholar
However, matrix factorization methods may not make full use of the limited information from rating or check-in matrices, and achieve unsatisfying results.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, deep learning has proven able to learn good representation in natural language processing, image classification, and so on.	Semantic Scholar
Along this line, we propose a new representation learning framework called Recommendation via Dual-Autoencoder (ReDa).	Semantic Scholar
In this framework, we simultaneously learn the new hidden representations of users and items using autoencoders, and minimize the deviations of training data by the learnt representations of users and items.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this framework, we develop a gradient descent method to learn hidden representations.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments conducted on several real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared with state-of-the-art matrix factorization based methods.	Semantic Scholar
For a natural social human-robot interaction, it is essential for a robot to learn the human-like social skills.	Semantic Scholar
However, learning such skills is notoriously hard due to the limited availability of direct instructions from people to teach a robot.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose an intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning framework in which an agent gets the intrinsic motivation-based rewards through the action-conditional predictive model.	Semantic Scholar
By using the proposed method, the robot learned the social skills from the human-robot interaction experiences gathered in the real uncontrolled environments.	Semantic Scholar
The results indicate that the robot not only acquired human-like social skills but also took more human-like decisions, on a test dataset, than a robot which received direct rewards for the task achievement.	Semantic Scholar
As part of our research on developing different types of Giacometti robots, the potential of a very long, very light, and very simple robot arm with a balloon body is discussed in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
Although this robot arm is not suitable for precise positioning, rapid motion, and high load capacity, which are the aspects most conventional robots focus on, it is designed for very specific purposes, such as inspection using a small camera at its tip and is designed to be essentially safe even if it falls down or hits an object.	Semantic Scholar
This robot arm is realized using helium-filled balloon bodies and thin pneumatic muscles.	Semantic Scholar
The arm achieves self-weight compensation, and the possibility of designing a very long arm is confirmed theoretically and experimentally.	Semantic Scholar
A prototype of a 7-m-long cantilever arm is designed, developed, and tested.	Semantic Scholar
We address the problem of restoring a high-resolution face image from a blurry low-resolution input.	Semantic Scholar
This problem is difficult as super-resolution and deblurring need to be tackled simultaneously.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, existing algorithms cannot handle face images well as low-resolution face images do not have much texture which is especially critical for deblurring.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose an effective algorithm by utilizing the domain-specific knowledge of human faces to recover high-quality faces.	Semantic Scholar
We first propose a facial component guided deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to restore a coarse face image, which is denoted as the base image where the facial component is automatically generated from the input face image.	Semantic Scholar
However, the CNN based method cannot handle image details well.	Semantic Scholar
We further develop a novel exemplar-based detail enhancement algorithm via facial component matching.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms both quantitatively and qualitatively.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a sliding mode control (SMC) based approach to address the velocity tracking and head-angle control problem of a planar snake robot.	Semantic Scholar
The motion characteristics of a snake exhibit the generation of propulsive force as a result of anisotropic friction with respect to the ground.	Semantic Scholar
To imitate the motion of a snake, all the joints of the snake robot are tracked to a serpenoid gait function utilizing virtual holonomic constraints.	Semantic Scholar
The parameters of the gait function are obtained from the SMC resulting in head-angle control and velocity tracking.	Semantic Scholar
SMC has been chosen to ensure robustness and stability of the system in the presence of uncertainties arising from variation in the friction force coefficients between the robot and the ground.	Semantic Scholar
Lyapunov's stability analysis proves the finite-time stability of the system.	Semantic Scholar
The control scheme has also been verified and compared with an existing approach through simulation studies.	Semantic Scholar
Autonomous mobile robots perform many tasks, such as grasping and inspection, that may require complete models of three-dimensional (3-D) objects in the environment.	Semantic Scholar
If little or no knowledge about an object is known a priori, the robot must take sensor measurements from strategically determined viewpoints in order to reconstruct a 3-D model of the object.	Semantic Scholar
We propose an autonomous object reconstruction approach for mobile robots that is very general, with no assumptions about object shape or size, such as a bounding box or predetermined set of candidate viewpoints.	Semantic Scholar
A probabilistic, volumetric method for determining the optimal next-best view is developed based on a partial model of a 3-D object of unknown shape and size.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method integrates an object probability characteristic to determine sensor views that incrementally reconstruct a 3-D model of the object.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments in simulation and on a real-world robot validate the work and compare it to the state of the art.	Semantic Scholar
Robots require novel reasoning systems to achieve complex objectives in new environments.	Semantic Scholar
Daily activities in the physical world combine two types of reasoning: discrete and continuous.	Semantic Scholar
For example, to set the table in Figure 1, the robot must make discrete decisions about which and in what order to pick objects, and it must execute these decisions by computing continuous motions to reach objects or desired locations.	Semantic Scholar
Robotics has traditionally treated these issues in isolation.	Semantic Scholar
Reasoning about discrete events is referred to as task planning, while reasoning about and computing continuous motions is in the realm of motion planning.	Semantic Scholar
Graph classification is an important tool for analyzing data with structure dependency, where subgraphs are often used as features for learning.	Semantic Scholar
In reality, the dimension of the subgraphs crucially depends on the threshold setting of the frequency support parameter, and the number may become extremely large.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, subgraphs may be incrementally discovered to form a feature stream and require the underlying graph classifier to effectively discover representative subgraph features from the subgraph feature stream.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a primal-dual incremental subgraph feature selection algorithm (ISF) based on a max-margin graph classifier.	Semantic Scholar
The ISF algorithm constructs a sequence of solutions that are both primal and dual feasible.	Semantic Scholar
Each primal-dual pair shrinks the dual gap and renders a better solution for the optimal subgraph feature set.	Semantic Scholar
To avoid bias of ISF algorithm on short-pattern subgraph features, we present a new incremental subgraph join feature selection algorithm (ISJF) by forcing graph classifiers to join short-pattern subgraphs and generate long-pattern subgraph features.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate the performance of the proposed models on both synthetic networks and real-world social network data sets.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.	Semantic Scholar
The helical microstructure has been regarded as one of the essential geometrical shapes widely utilized in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and lab on chip systems.	Semantic Scholar
Different manufacture methods for helical microstructures attracted the researchers’ attention due to their respective advantages.	Semantic Scholar
Inspired by traditional machining techniques, this letter reports a new manufacture method for accurate three-dimensional (3-D) helical microstructures based on in situ scanning electron microscope (SEM) nanorobotic manipulation system.	Semantic Scholar
Compared with existing manufacture techniques, our proposed method is laconic, precise, and material unconstrained.	Semantic Scholar
Besides, in situ force and electric measurement can be realized immediately after the helical microstructure being manufactured.	Semantic Scholar
First, in this letter, the system with three degrees-of-freedom nanorobotic manipulator integrated inside the SEM.	Semantic Scholar
Second, the 3-D manufacture method with proportional integral derivative control is proposed to fabricate the desired helical microstructures.	Semantic Scholar
After that, the helical microstructures are manufactured and the manufacturing accuracy is analyzed.	Semantic Scholar
The manufacturing accuracy can be controlled within 10  $\boldsymbol {\mu}$m.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the force and electric demarcation of the fabricated helical microstructure is conducted to excavate the potential adhibition in in situ SEM force and electric measurement, components for MEMS and lab on chip systems, etc.	Semantic Scholar
This research opens new prospects for the precise in situ 3-D manufacture of helical microstructures via the nanorobotic system, which is expected to give a long-term impact on MEMS, lab on chip systems, telecommunications, etc.	Semantic Scholar
In many manufacturing systems, each piece of intermediate product is attached to a dedicated carrier (e.g., pallet, skid, fixture, etc.)	Semantic Scholar
throughout the entire process for material handling and/or transportation purposes.	Semantic Scholar
Once a part finishes all processing steps, the associated carrier will be removed and returned to the front of the production process to pick up new incoming parts.	Semantic Scholar
We referred to production systems operating in such manner as “closed.” In the current literature, available results on closed production systems are very limited.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study transient performance of closed serial lines with machines that operate according to the Bernoulli reliability model.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, exact mathematical model for the system considered is derived based on Markov analysis.	Semantic Scholar
Then, formulas for calculating the system's performance measures during transients are obtained based on the model.	Semantic Scholar
An approximation method is proposed to estimate a closed Bernoulli line's performance in completing a finite production run.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, properties of finite production run-based closed Bernoulli lines during transient are investigated.	Semantic Scholar

When force feedback is employed in bilateral teleoperation of a robotic system, classical control techniques can become unstable in the presence of communication latency.	Semantic Scholar
An established solution to this problem employs the scattering transformation to guarantee passivity.	Semantic Scholar
This transformation requires the selection of a wave impedance parameter that strongly affects transparency to the operator.	Semantic Scholar
It is widely recognized that a large impedance value is well suited to contact tasks and a low value is preferable for free motion.	Semantic Scholar
However, in any realistic manipulation task, both forms of motion will exist during at least a portion of the task.	Semantic Scholar
Some amount of free motion will typically be necessary during approach to the contact site; and, even after transition to contact has occurred, free motion considerations will still dominate on the axes parallel to the manipulated surface.	Semantic Scholar
This paper explores analytically this tradeoff, proposing an optimal solution from the linear systems theory.	Semantic Scholar
Choice of controller gains is additionally discussed.	Semantic Scholar
Attention is also given to the feedback-passivized scheme of Chopra et al.	Semantic Scholar
, which is shown to be free of the fundamental wave impedance tradeoff that dominates the classical wave-based approach.	Semantic Scholar
In real-world applications, objects of multiple types are interconnected, forming <italic>Heterogeneous Information Networks</italic>.	Semantic Scholar
In such heterogeneous information networks, we make the key observation that many interactions happen due to some <italic>event</italic> and the objects in each event form a complete semantic unit.	Semantic Scholar
By taking advantage of such a property, we propose a generic framework called <italic><bold>H</bold>yper<bold>E</bold>dge- </italic><bold>B</bold><italic>ased</italic> <bold>E</bold><italic>mbedding</italic> (<sc>Hebe</sc>) to learn object embeddings with events in heterogeneous information networks, where a <italic>hyperedge</italic> encompasses the objects participating in one event.	Semantic Scholar
The <sc>Hebe</sc> framework models the proximity among objects in each event with two methods: (1) predicting a target object given other participating objects in the event, and (2) predicting if the event can be observed given all the participating objects.	Semantic Scholar
Since each hyperedge encapsulates more information of a given event, <sc>Hebe</sc> is robust to data sparseness and noise.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, <sc>Hebe</sc> is scalable when the data size spirals.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets show the efficacy and robustness of the proposed framework.	Semantic Scholar
Efficient processing of skyline queries with partially ordered domains has been intensively addressed in recent years.	Semantic Scholar
To further reduce the query processing time to support high-responsive applications, the skyline queries that were previously processed with user preferences similar to those of the new query contribute useful candidate result points.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, the answered queries can be cached with both their results and the user preferences such that the query processor can rapidly retrieve the result for a new query only from the result sets of cached queries with compatible user preferences.	Semantic Scholar
When caching a significant number of queries accumulated over time, it is essential to adopt effective access methods to index the cached queries to retrieve a set of relevant cached queries for facilitating the cache-based skyline query computations.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose an extended depth-first search indexing method (e-DFS for short) for accessing user preference profiles represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and emphasize the design of the e-DFS encoding that effectively encodes a user preference profile into a low-dimensional feature point which is eventually indexed by an R-tree.	Semantic Scholar
We obtain one or more traversal orders for each node in a DAG by traversing it through a modified version of the depth-first search which is utilized to examine the topology structure and dominance relations to measure closeness or similarity.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, e-DFS which combines the criteria of similarity evaluation is able to greatly reduce the search space by filtering out most of the irrelevant cached queries such that the query processor can avoid accessing the entire data set to compute the query results.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments are presented to demonstrate the performance and utility of our indexing method, which outperforms the baseline planning techniques by reducing 37 percent of the computational time on average.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a novel miniature robotic endoscope that is small enough to pass through the Eustachian tube and provides visualization of the middle ear (ME).	Semantic Scholar
The device features a miniature bending tip previously conceived of as a small-scale robotic wrist that has been adapted to carry and aim a small chip-tip camera and fiber-optic light sources.	Semantic Scholar
The motivation for trans-Eustachian tube ME inspection is to provide a natural-orifice-based route to the ME that does not require cutting or lifting the eardrum, as is currently required.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we first perform an analysis of the ME anatomy and use a computational design optimization platform to derive the kinematic requirements for endoscopic inspection of the ME through the Eustachian tube.	Semantic Scholar
Based on these requirements, we fabricate the proposed device and use it to demonstrate the feasibility of ME inspection in an anthropomorphic model, i.e., a 3-D printed ME phantom generated from patient image data.	Semantic Scholar
We show that our prototype provides > 74% visibility coverage of the sinus tympani, a region of the ME crucial for diagnosis, compared to an average of only 6.9% using a straight nonarticulated endoscope through the Eustachian tube.	Semantic Scholar

This paper considers the bipartite leader-following synchronization in a signed network composed by an array of coupled delayed neural networks by utilizing the pinning control strategy and M-matrix theory, where the communication links between neighboring nodes of the network can be either positive or negative.	Semantic Scholar
Under the assumption that the node-delay is bounded and differentiable, a sufficient condition in terms of a low-dimensional linear matrix inequality is derived for reaching bipartite leader-following synchronization in the signed network, based on which a simple algebraic formula is further given to estimate an upper bound of the node-delay.	Semantic Scholar
When the node-delay is bounded and non-differentiable, some criteria are established by using the descriptor method and the reciprocally convex approach such that the bipartite leader-following synchronization problem for the signed network can be successfully solved.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of theoretical analysis.	Semantic Scholar
Recovering the low-rank, sparse components of a given matrix is a challenging problem that arises in many real applications.	Semantic Scholar
Existing traditional approaches aimed at solving this problem are usually recast as a general approximation problem of a low-rank matrix.	Semantic Scholar
These approaches are based on the nuclear norm of the matrix, and thus in practice the rank may not be well approximated.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a new approach to solve this problem that is based on a new norm of a matrix, called the truncated nuclear norm (TNN).	Semantic Scholar
An efficient iterative scheme developed under the linearized alternating direction method multiple framework is proposed, where two novel iterative algorithms are designed to recover the sparse and low-rank components of matrix.	Semantic Scholar
More importantly, the convergence of the linearized alternating direction method multiple on our matrix recovering model is discussed and proved mathematically.	Semantic Scholar
To validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, a series of comparative trials are performed on a variety of synthetic data sets.	Semantic Scholar
More specifically, the new methods are used to deal with problems associated with background subtraction (foreground object detection), and removing shadows and peculiarities from images of faces.	Semantic Scholar
Our experimental results illustrate that our new frameworks are more effective and accurate when compared with other methods.	Semantic Scholar
The availability of environment maps for autonomous robots enables them to complete several tasks.	Semantic Scholar
A new IEEE standard, IEEE 1873-2015, Robot Map Data Representation for Navigation (MDR) [15], sponsored by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS) and approved by the IEEE Standards Association Standards Board in September 2015, defines a common representation for two-dimensional (2-D) robot maps and is intended to facilitate interoperability among navigating robots.

The standard defines an extensible markup language (XML) data format for exchanging maps between different systems.	Semantic Scholar
This article illustrates how metric maps, topological maps, and their combinations can be represented according to the standard.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a renewed overview of photosensor oculography (PSOG), an eye-tracking technique based on the use of simple photosensors (usually infrared) to measure the overall amount of reflected light while the eye rotates.	Semantic Scholar
PSOG can provide high spatial and temporal resolution, low tracking latency, and reduced power consumption.	Semantic Scholar
The deeper examination of this technique is particularly important, given the current needs for efficient eye-tracking mechanisms by the emerging interaction devices, e.g., augmented and virtual reality headsets.	Semantic Scholar
In our investigation, we employ an adjustable simulation framework to examine the eye-tracking performance when changing the parameters of different PSOG designs.	Semantic Scholar
We focus our examination on eye-tracking accuracy and crosstalk, two crucial characteristics for the seamless interaction via eye-tracking.	Semantic Scholar
Our experiments demonstrate the parameter values (or ranges) that lead to different levels of performance for accuracy and crosstalk.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that the optimization of accuracy and crosstalk is often driven by competing conditions, and thus, we perform a multi-objective optimization procedure and estimate the respective trade-off parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we present the effects from sensor shifts and evaluate the resulting increase in accuracy error.	Semantic Scholar
Our results and analysis can be used to facilitate the selection of parameters in future PSOG systems.	Semantic Scholar
Searching is a necessary tool for managing and navigating the massive amounts of data available in today's information age.	Semantic Scholar
While new searching methods have become increasingly popular and reliable in recent years, such as image-based searching, these methods may be more limited than text-based means in that they do not allow generic user input.	Semantic Scholar
Sketch-based searching is a method that allows users to draw generic search queries and return similar drawn images, giving more user control over their search content.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present SketchSeeker, a system for indexing and searching across a large number of sketches quickly based on their similarity.	Semantic Scholar
SketchSeeker introduces a technique for indexing sketches in extremely compressed representations, which allows for fast, accurate retrieval augmented with a multilevel ranking subsystem.	Semantic Scholar
SketchSeeker was tested on a large set of sketches against existing sketch similarity metrics, and it shows significant improvements in terms of storage requirements, speed, and accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
A robust automated system to collect protein crystals for X-ray crystallography is presented.	Semantic Scholar
This system uses an ultraviolet imaging system based on commercial off-the-shelf components, a magnetically manipulated tool, and a resilient behavior-based controller.	Semantic Scholar
The system is validated by collecting over 350 polystyrene beads, used as crystal emulators, and transporting them 2 mm to a predefined goal in a 14-h period without human intervention.	Semantic Scholar
The average time to identify, collect, transport, and deliver a crystal emulator is 2.4 min, similar to an expert operator.	Semantic Scholar
This is the first demonstration of a completely automated robust system for protein crystal harvesting.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a new method to address the problem of task-constrained motion planning for aerial manipulators.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a control-aware planner based on the paradigm of tight coupling between planning and control.	Semantic Scholar
Such paradigm is especially useful in aerial manipulation, where the separation between planning and control is not advisable.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed sampling based motion planner uses a controller composed of a second-order inverse kinematics algorithm and a dynamic tracker, as a local planner, thus allowing a more natural consideration of the closed-loop system dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
For task-constrained motions, this method let us to sample directly in the reduced and more relevant task space, predict the behavior of the controller avoiding motions that bring to singularities or large tracking errors, and guarantee the correct execution of the maneuver.	Semantic Scholar
The method is tested in simulation for a multidirectional-thrust vehicle endowed with a 2-DoF manipulator.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach is very general, and could be applied to ground and underwater robotic systems to perform manipulation or inspection tasks.	Semantic Scholar
This work contributes to a compositional theory of “codesign” that allows to optimally design a robotic platform.	Semantic Scholar
In this framework, the user describes each subsystem as a monotone relation between “functionality” provided and “resources” required.	Semantic Scholar
These models can be easily composed to express the codesign constraints among different subsystems.	Semantic Scholar
The user then queries the model to obtain the design with minimal resources usage, subject to a lower bound on the provided functionality.	Semantic Scholar
This letter concerns the introduction of uncertainty in the framework.	Semantic Scholar
Uncertainty has two roles: First, it allows to deal with limited knowledge of the models; second, it also can be used to generate consistent relaxations of a problem, as the computation requirements can be lowered, should the user accept some uncertainty in the answer.	Semantic Scholar

This paper proposes a control framework based on auditory perception.	Semantic Scholar
Generally, in robot audition, the motion control of a robot from the sense of hearing relies on sound source localization.	Semantic Scholar
We propose in this paper an alternative approach, aural servo, which is derived from the sensor-based control framework.	Semantic Scholar
In this approach, robot motions are directly connected to the aural perception: The variation of low-level auditory features dictates the motions applied to the robot through a feedback loop.	Semantic Scholar
It has the advantage of being robust to spurious measurements and modeling approximations for a low computational cost.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents the theoretical concept of the aural servo framework.	Semantic Scholar
Besides a theoretical analysis, the aural servo framework is validated through several experiments on different robotic platforms and under real-world conditions.	Semantic Scholar
As the worlds of commerce and the Internet technology become more inextricably linked, a large number of user consumption series become available for online market intelligence analysis.	Semantic Scholar
A critical demand along this line is to predict the future product adoption state of each user, which enables a wide range of applications such as targeted marketing.	Semantic Scholar
Nevertheless, previous works only aimed at predicting if a user would adopt a particular product or not with a binary buy-or-not representation.	Semantic Scholar
The problem of tracking and predicting users’ adoption rates, i.e., the frequency and regularity of using each product over time, is still under-explored.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we present a comprehensive study of product adoption rate prediction in a competitive market.	Semantic Scholar
This task is nontrivial as there are three major challenges in modeling users’ complex adoption states: the heterogeneous data sources around users, the unique user preference and the competitive product selection.	Semantic Scholar
To deal with these challenges, we first introduce a flexible factor-based decision function to capture the change of users’ product adoption rate over time, where various factors that may influence users’ decisions from heterogeneous data sources can be leveraged.	Semantic Scholar
Using this factor-based decision function, we then provide two corresponding models to learn the parameters of the decision function with both generalized and personalized assumptions of users’ preferences.	Semantic Scholar
We further study how to leverage the competition among different products and simultaneously learn product competition and users’ preferences with both generalized and personalized assumptions.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show the superiority of our proposed models.	Semantic Scholar
Stability is not trivial in aerial manipulation tasks because of the dynamical coupling between the aerial vehicle and the manipulator.	Semantic Scholar
This is especially true when the manipulator becomes heavy, so that its dynamics can be significant.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, a stabilizing controller for the regulation of overall system will be designed without using any assumptions on the dynamic model.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, thorough discussion with simulation validation is presented.	Semantic Scholar
When governed by underlying low-dimensional dynamics, the interdependence of simultaneously recorded populations of neurons can be explained by a small number of shared factors, or a low-dimensional trajectory.	Semantic Scholar
Recovering these latent trajectories, particularly from single-trial population recordings, may help us understand the dynamics that drive neural computation.	Semantic Scholar
However, due to the biophysical constraints and noise in the spike trains, inferring trajectories from data is a challenging statistical problem in general.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we propose a practical and efficient inference method, the variational latent gaussian process (vLGP).	Semantic Scholar
The vLGP combines a generative model with a history-dependent point process observation, together with a smoothness prior on the latent trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
The vLGP improves on earlier methods for recovering latent trajectories, which assume either observation models inappropriate for point processes or linear dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
We compare and validate vLGP on both simulated data sets and population recordings from the primary visual cortex.	Semantic Scholar
In the V1 data set, we find that vLGP achieves substantially higher performance than previous methods for predicting omitted spike trains, as well as capturing both the toroidal topology of visual stimuli space and the noise correlation.	Semantic Scholar
These results show that vLGP is a robust method with the potential to reveal hidden neural dynamics from large-scale neural recordings.	Semantic Scholar
The design of mobile autonomous robots is challenging due to the limited on-board resources such as processing power and energy.	Semantic Scholar
A promising approach is to generate intelligent schedules that reduce the resource consumption while maintaining best performance, or more interestingly, to tradeoff reduced resource consumption for a slightly lower but still acceptable level of performance.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we provide a framework that is automatic and quantitative to aid designers in exploring such resource-performance tradeoffs and finding schedules for mobile robots, guided by questions such as “what is the minimum resource budget required to achieve a given level of performance?” The framework is based on a quantitative multiobjective verification technique, which, for a collection of possibly conflicting objectives, produces the Pareto front that contains all the achievable optimal tradeoffs.	Semantic Scholar
The designer then selects a specific Pareto point based on the resource constraints and desired performance level, and a correct-by-construction schedule that meets those constraints is automatically generated.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework on several robotic scenarios in both simulations and experiments.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we consider the problem of learning Boolean formulae from examples obtained by actively querying an oracle that can label these examples as either positive or negative.	Semantic Scholar
This problem has received attention in both machine learning as well as formal methods communities, and it has been shown to have exponential worst-case complexity in the general case as well as for many restrictions.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we focus on learning sparse Boolean formulae which depend on only a small (but unknown) subset of the overall vocabulary of atomic propositions.	Semantic Scholar
We propose two algorithms—first, based on binary search in the Hamming space, and the second, based on random walk on the Boolean hypercube, to learn these sparse Boolean formulae with a given confidence.	Semantic Scholar
This assumption of sparsity is motivated by the problem of mining explanations for decisions made by artificially intelligent (AI) algorithms, where the explanation of individual decisions may depend on a small but unknown subset of all the inputs to the algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the use of these algorithms in automatically generating explanations of these decisions.	Semantic Scholar
These explanations will make intelligent systems more understandable and accountable to human users, facilitate easier audits and provide diagnostic information in the case of failure.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach treats the AI algorithm as a black-box oracle; hence, it is broadly applicable and agnostic to the specific AI algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the number of examples needed for both proposed algorithms only grows logarithmically with the size of the vocabulary of atomic propositions.	Semantic Scholar
We illustrate the practical effectiveness of our approach on a diverse set of case studies.	Semantic Scholar
Robotics technology has recently matured sufficiently to deploy autonomous robotic systems for daily use in several applications: from disaster response to environmental monitoring and logistics.	Semantic Scholar
In such applications, robots must establish collaborative interactions so to achieve their individual and collective goals and a key problem is for robots to make individual decisions so to optimize a system wide objective function.	Semantic Scholar
This problem is typically referred to as coordination.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we first describe modern optimization techniques for coordination in multiRobot systems.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we focus on approaches that are based on algorithms widely used to solve graphical models and constraint optimization problems, such as the max-sum algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
We then analyse the coordination problem faced by a set of robots operating in a warehouse logistic application.	Semantic Scholar
In this context robots must transport items from loading to unloading bays so to complete packages to be delivered to customers.	Semantic Scholar
Robots must cooperate to maximizes the number of packages completed in the unit of time.	Semantic Scholar
To this end a crucial component is to avoid interferences when moving in the environment.	Semantic Scholar
We show how such problem can be formalised as a Distributed Constrained Optimization problem and we provide a solution based on the binary max-sum algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we provide a quantitative evaluation of our approach in a simulated scenario using standard robotics tools (ROS and Gazebo).	Semantic Scholar
The traditional artificial neural network (ANN) inversion of electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) based on gradient descent algorithm is known to be inept for its low computation efficiency and does not ensure global convergence.	Semantic Scholar
In order to solve above problems, a kernel principal component wavelet neural network (KPCWNN) trained by an improved shuffled frog leaping algorithm (ISFLA) method is proposed in this study.	Semantic Scholar
An additional kernel principal component (KPC) layer is applied to reduce the dimensionality of apparent resistivity data and increase the computational efficiency of wavelet neural network (WNN).	Semantic Scholar
Meanwhile, a novel ISFLA algorithm is adopted for improving the learning ability and inversion quality of WNN.	Semantic Scholar
In the proposed ISFLA, a hybrid LC mutation attractor is used to enhance the exploitation ability and a differential updating rule is used to enhance the exploration ability.	Semantic Scholar
Four groups of experiments are considered to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed inversion method.	Semantic Scholar
The inversion results of the synthetic and field examples show that the introduced method is superior to other algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, which contribute to better inversion results.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a novel control algorithm to regulate the aerodynamic thrust produced by fixed-pitch rotors commonly used on small-scale electrically powered multirotor aerial vehicles.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed controller significantly improves the disturbance rejection and gust tolerance of rotor thrust control compared to state-of-the-art RPM (revolutions per minute) rotor control schemes.	Semantic Scholar
The thrust modeling approach taken is based on a model of aerodynamic power generated by a fixed-pitch rotor and computed in real time on the embedded electronic speed controllers  using measurements of electrical power and rotor angular velocity.	Semantic Scholar
Static and dynamic flight tests were carried out in downdrafts and updrafts of varying strengths to quantify the resulting improvement in maintaining a desired thrust setpoint.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of the proposed approach in flight conditions is demonstrated by a path tracking experiment, where a quadrotor was flown through an artificial wind gust and the trajectory tracking error was measured.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach for thrust control demonstrably reduced the tracking error compared to classical RPM rotor control.	Semantic Scholar

Constraint Programming (CP) has proven to be an effective platform for constraint based sequence mining.	Semantic Scholar
Previous work has focused on standard frequent sequence mining, as well as frequent sequence mining with a maximum ’gap’ between two matching events in a sequence.	Semantic Scholar
The main challenge in the latter is that this constraint can not be imposed independently of the omnipresent frequency constraint.	Semantic Scholar
Indeed, the gap constraint changes whether a subsequence is included in a sequence, and hence its frequency.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we go beyond that and investigate the integration of timed events and constraining the minimum/maximum gap as well as minimum/maximum span.	Semantic Scholar
The latter constrains the allowed time between the first and last matching event of a pattern.	Semantic Scholar
We show how the three are interrelated, and what the required changes to the frequency constraint are.	Semantic Scholar
Key in our approach is the concept of an extension window defined by gap/span and we develop techniques to avoid scanning the sequences needlessly, as well as using a backtracking-aware data structure.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms both specialized and CP-based approaches in almost all cases and that the advantage increases as the minimum frequency threshold decreases.	Semantic Scholar
This paper is an extension of the original manuscript presented at CPAIOR’17 [5].	Semantic Scholar
The linear inverted pendulum model is often used to study walking gaits, but the transition from one step to the following step is often neglected, whereas it is really important for the walking stability.	Semantic Scholar
This letter studies different landing positions of the swing foot, and different conditions to switch the stance leg, based on time or on the configuration of the robot.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown that self-synchronization of the motion in sagittal and frontal planes is dependent on different switching conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Neither self-synchronization nor self-stabilization is observed when the stance leg switching is based on time or when both the step length and width are fixed.	Semantic Scholar
On the other hand, self-synchronization can be obtained when the switching condition of the stance leg is based on a linear combination of the positions of the center of mass (CoM) along the sagittal and frontal axes.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, self-stabilization can be obtained when the velocity of the CoM in the sagittal plane is taken into account.	Semantic Scholar
This letter deals with the development of a vision-based controller for a continuum robot architecture.	Semantic Scholar
More precisely, the controlled robotic structure is based on three-tube concentric tube robot (CTR), an emerging paradigm to design accurate, miniaturized, and flexible endoscopic robots.	Semantic Scholar
This approach has grown considerably in the recent years finding applications in numerous surgical disciplines.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to conventional robotic structures, CTR kinematics arise many challenges for an optimal control, such as friction, torsion, shear, and nonlinear constitutive behavior.	Semantic Scholar
In fact, in order to ensure efficient and reliable control, in addition to computing an analytical and complete kinematic model, it is also important to close the control loop.	Semantic Scholar
To do this, we developed an eye-in-hand visual servoing scheme using a millimeter-sized camera embedded at the robot's tip.	Semantic Scholar
Both the kinematic model and the visual servoing controller were successfully validated in simulation with visual servoing platform and using an experimental setup.	Semantic Scholar
The obtained results showed satisfactory performances for three-degrees of freedom positioning and path following tasks with adaptive gain control.	Semantic Scholar
Ecological interface design (EID) was originally developed in the context of process control but has been extended into many domains where technology has resulted in both changing work demands and increased opportunities for improved interface applications.	Semantic Scholar
This paper gives an overview of the application of the EID to the control of vehicle locomotion, either from within the vehicle, as a driver or a pilot, or from the outside, as an operator or a (air traffic) controller.	Semantic Scholar
It discusses lessons learned from the application of the EID for the vehicle locomotion control task and focuses on how the methodology can be applied to this domain.	Semantic Scholar
Specific issues identified are that the planning and control of a vehicle simultaneously spans multiple time scales and that the interface must be designed considering the format in which the control input is defined.	Semantic Scholar
Also, due to the extensive standardization of the instrumentation and training certification, changes introduced by the new displays must initially be additional to the existing displays.	Semantic Scholar
Chosen representations must also be shown in a format that matches the current instrumentation and the directly observable outside world.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel deep learning framework for bidirectional translation between robot actions and their linguistic descriptions.	Semantic Scholar
Our model consists of two recurrent autoencoders (RAEs).	Semantic Scholar
One RAE learns to encode action sequences as fixed-dimensional vectors in a way that allows the sequences to be reproduced from the vectors by its decoder.	Semantic Scholar
The other RAE learns to encode descriptions in a similar way.	Semantic Scholar
In the learning process, in addition to reproduction losses, we create another loss function whereby the representations of an action and its corresponding description approach each other in the latent vector space.	Semantic Scholar
Across the shared representation, the trained model can produce a linguistic description given a robot action.	Semantic Scholar
The model is also able to generate an appropriate action by receiving a linguistic instruction, conditioned on the current visual input.	Semantic Scholar
Visualization of the latent representations shows that the robot actions are embedded in a semantically compositional way in the vector space by being learned jointly with descriptions.	Semantic Scholar
Numerous types of robots are being interwoven into the health-care system, including rehabilitative devices for use with pediatric populations.	Semantic Scholar
Yet a key ethical concern is that pediatric patients, their parents, and other caregivers might begin to overtrust robotic technology, possibly resulting in a patient being harmed or the technology adopted prematurely.	Semantic Scholar
To gain insight into the issue, our research team conducted a study examining the potential of overtrust in pediatric robotics.	Semantic Scholar
This article discusses results from a survey of parents who have at least one child with a movement disability.	Semantic Scholar
The survey's focus is on robotic exoskeletons, which represent the most viable of the currently available robotic technologies in terms of being adopted into the home as a clinically validated rehabilitative device for both adults and children.	Semantic Scholar
More than 62% of respondents indicated they would typically or completely trust their child to handle risky situations with an exoskeleton, even though the technology may not be designed for such situations.	Semantic Scholar
We conclude with suggestions for future research directions on the problem of overtrust in health-care robotics.	Semantic Scholar

In this paper, we address the connectivity maintenance problem for a multirobot system that moves according to a given bounded collective control objective.	Semantic Scholar
We assume that the interaction among the robotic units is limited by a given visibility radius both in terms of sensing and communication capabilities.	Semantic Scholar
For this scenario, we propose a decentralized bounded control law that can provably preserve the connectivity of the multirobot system over time.	Semantic Scholar
We characterize the effect of the connectivity control term on the achievement of the collective control objective by resorting to an input-to-state stability-like analysis.	Semantic Scholar
We provide numerical and experimental results to corroborate the theoretical findings and assess the effectiveness of the proposed bounded connectivity maintenance control law.	Semantic Scholar
Trip hazards are a significant contributor to accidents on construction and manufacturing sites.	Semantic Scholar
Current safety inspections are labor intensive and limited by human fallibility, making automation of trip hazard detection appealing from both a safety and economic perspective.	Semantic Scholar
Trip hazards present an interesting challenge to modern learning techniques because they are defined as much by affordance as by object type, for example, wires on a table are not a trip hazard, but can be if lying on the ground.	Semantic Scholar
To address these challenges, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the performance characteristics of 11 different colors and depth fusion approaches, including four fusion and one nonfusion approach, using color and two types of depth images.	Semantic Scholar
Trained and tested on more than 600 labeled trip hazards over four floors and 2000 m2 in an active construction site, this approach was able to differentiate between identical objects in different physical configurations.	Semantic Scholar
Outperforming a color-only detector, our multimodal trip detector fuses color and depth information to achieve a 4% absolute improvement in F1-score.	Semantic Scholar
These investigative results and the extensive publicly available dataset move us one step closer to assistive or fully automated safety inspection systems on construction sites.	Semantic Scholar
Cell morphology plays an important role in maintaining normal cellular functions.	Semantic Scholar
Existing techniques for cell morphology measurement, such as confocal imaging and atomic force microscopy, have the limitations of photobleaching and incompatibility for integration with other cell manipulation instruments.	Semantic Scholar
This paper reports a robotic cell manipulation system that is capable of measuring changes of cell morphologies.	Semantic Scholar
This capability is enabled by several key techniques including cell recognition, determination of contact points on a cell, and two vision-based contact detection methods for measuring cell bottom and top surface positions.	Semantic Scholar
With the detected cell contour and height information, three-dimensional cell morphology is reconstructed.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments show that the cell morphology measurement technique has an overall success rate of 95.67%, an average measurement speed of 2.63 s/contact, and a measurement error of 4.65%.	Semantic Scholar
The cell morphology measurement results indicate that bladder cancer cells with higher metastatic potential exhibit lower cell heights than earlier-stage cancer cells because of more disorganized cytoskeleton networks.	Semantic Scholar
We also applied the robotic system to microinject the drug Cytochalasin D into cancer cells, and the drug effect on cell morphology changes was quantified.	Semantic Scholar
Despite many attempts in the last few years, automatic analysis of social scenes captured by wide-angle camera networks remains a very challenging task due to the low resolution of targets, background clutter and frequent and persistent occlusions.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a novel framework for jointly estimating (i) head, body orientations of targets and (ii) conversational groups called F-formations from social scenes.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to prior works that have (a) exploited the limited range of head and body orientations to jointly learn both, or (b) employed the mutual head (but not body) pose of interactors for deducing F-formations, we propose a weakly-supervised learning algorithm for joint inference.	Semantic Scholar
Our algorithm employs body pose as the primary cue for F-formation estimation, and an alternating optimization strategy is proposed to iteratively refine F-formation and pose estimates.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the increased efficacy of joint inference over the state-of-the-art via extensive experiments on three social datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Many complex combinatorial problems arising from a range of scientific applications (such as computer networks, mathematical chemistry and bioinformatics) involve searching for an undirected graph satisfying a given property.	Semantic Scholar
Since for any possible solution there can be a large number of isomorphic representations, these problems can quickly become intractable.	Semantic Scholar
One way to mitigate this problem is to eliminate as many isomorphic copies as possible by breaking symmetry during search - i.e.	Semantic Scholar
by introducing constraints that ensure that at least one representative graph is generated for each equivalence class, but not the entire class.	Semantic Scholar
The goal is to generate as few members of each class as possible - ideally exactly one: the symmetry break is said to be complete in this case.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we introduce novel, effective and compact, symmetry breaking constraints for undirected graph search.	Semantic Scholar
While incomplete, these prove highly beneficial in pruning the search for a graph.	Semantic Scholar
We illustrate the application of symmetry breaking in graph representation to resolve several open instances in extremal graph theory.	Semantic Scholar
We also illustrate the application of our approach to graph edge coloring problems which exhibit additional symmetries due to the fact that the colors of the edges in any solution can be permuted.	Semantic Scholar
Many robotics applications involving contact with objects require the decomposition of an external force measured by a force sensor into its normal and shear components.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a general and effective contact force decomposition method based on the contact pressure distribution.	Semantic Scholar
The contact pressure distribution can be measured easily using recently developed flexible pressure sensor arrays.	Semantic Scholar
Our method requires no preprocessing and provides accurate force decomposition, even for concave external objects.	Semantic Scholar
These advantages are demonstrated by simulations and experiments.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we investigate the global exponential stability of inertial memristor-based neural networks with impulses and time-varying delays.	Semantic Scholar
We construct inertial memristor-based neural networks based on the characteristics of the inertial neural networks and memristor.	Semantic Scholar
Impulses with and without delays are considered when modeling the inertial neural networks simultaneously, which are of great practical significance in the current study.	Semantic Scholar
Some sufficient conditions are derived under the framework of the Lyapunov stability method, as well as an extended Halanay differential inequality and a new delay impulsive differential inequality, which depend on impulses with and without delays, in order to guarantee the global exponential stability of the inertial memristor-based neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.	Semantic Scholar
Learning appropriate metric is critical for effectively capturing complex data characteristics.	Semantic Scholar
The metric learning of categorical data with hierarchical coupling relationships and local heterogeneous distributions is very challenging yet rarely explored.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a Heterogeneous mEtric Learning with hIerarchical Couplings (HELIC for short) for this type of categorical data.	Semantic Scholar
HELIC captures both low-level value-to-attribute and high-level attribute-to-class hierarchical couplings, and reveals the intrinsic heterogeneities embedded in each level of couplings.	Semantic Scholar
Theoretical analyses of the effectiveness and generalization error bound verify that HELIC effectively represents the above complexities.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on 30 data sets with diverse characteristics demonstrate that HELIC-enabled classification significantly enhances the accuracy (up to 40.93 percent), compared with five state-of-the-art baselines.	Semantic Scholar

The CompCert C compiler guarantees that the target program behaves as the source program.	Semantic Scholar
Yet, source programs without a defined semantics do not benefit from this guarantee and could therefore be miscompiled.	Semantic Scholar
To reduce the possibility of a miscompilation, we propose a novel memory model for CompCert which gives a defined semantics to challenging features such as bitwise pointer arithmetics and access to uninitialised data.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our memory model both theoretically and experimentally.	Semantic Scholar
In our experiments, we identify pervasive low-level C idioms that require the additional expressiveness provided by our memory model.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that our memory model provably subsumes the existing CompCert memory model thus cross-validating both semantics.	Semantic Scholar
Our memory model relies on the core concepts of symbolic value and normalisation.	Semantic Scholar
A symbolic value models a delayed computation and the normalisation turns, when possible, a symbolic value into a genuine value.	Semantic Scholar
We show how to tame the expressive power of the normalisation so that the memory model fits the proof framework of CompCert.	Semantic Scholar
We also adapt the proofs of correctness of the compiler passes performed by CompCert’s front-end, thus demonstrating that our model is well-suited for proving compiler transformations.	Semantic Scholar
Anisotropic diffusion has many applications in image processing, but the high computational cost usually requires accuracy trade-offs in order to grant its applicability in practical problems.	Semantic Scholar
This is specially true when dealing with 3D images, where anisotropic diffusion should be able to provide interesting results for many applications, but the usual implementation methods greatly scale in complexity with the additional dimension.	Semantic Scholar
Here we propose a separable implementation of the most general anisotropic diffusion formulation, based on Gaussian convolutions, whose favorable computational complexity scales linearly with the number of dimensions, without any assumptions about specific parameterizations.	Semantic Scholar
We also present variants that bend the Gaussian kernels for improved results when dealing with highly anisotropic curved or sharp structures.	Semantic Scholar
We test the accuracy, speed, stability, and scale-space properties of the proposed methods, and present some results (both synthetic and real) which show their advantages, including up to 60 times faster computation in 3D with respect to the explicit method, improved accuracy and stability, and min–max preservation.	Semantic Scholar
While legged robots are well suited to navigating complex three-dimensional (3-D) environments, their practical applicability is still hampered by the time taken to plan manoeuvres to traverse these challenging environments.	Semantic Scholar
We present contact dynamic roadmaps (CDRM), which extend dynamic roadmaps with contact information.	Semantic Scholar
The CDRM is precomputed offline to generate a discretized mapping from each leg's workspace to its configuration space, and then adapted online to the environment to rapidly identify collision-free foothold positions.	Semantic Scholar
The concept behind this is to perform the expensive foothold candidate generation and collision checking phases offline and store the data for use in the online planner.	Semantic Scholar
The CDRM is coupled with a rapidly-exploring random tree planner to generate acyclic full-body motion plans in complex 3-D environments.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of the approach is validated and compared in simulation in a wide variety of scenarios that require full-body planning to successfully navigate.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a distributed collision avoidance algorithm for multiple dynamic vehicles moving in arbitrary dimensions.	Semantic Scholar
In our algorithm, each robot continually computes its buffered Voronoi cell (BVC) and plans its path within the BVC in a receding horizon fashion.	Semantic Scholar
We prove that our algorithm guarantees collision avoidance for robots with single integrator dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
We show that our algorithm has computational complexity of $O(k)$, which is the same as that of the optimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA) algorithm, and is considerably faster than model predictive control (MPC) and sequential convex programming (SCP) based approaches.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, ORCA and MPC-SCP require relative position, velocity, and even other information, to be exchanged over a communication network among the robots.	Semantic Scholar
Our algorithm only requires the sensed relative position, and therefore is well suited for on-line implementation as it does not require a communication network, and it works well with noisy relative position sensors.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we provide an extension of our algorithm to robots with higher-order dynamics like quadrotors.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the capabilities of our algorithm by comparing it to ORCA in multiple benchmark simulation scenarios, and we present results of over 70 experimental trials using five quadrotors in a motion capture environment.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a multi-agent framework to deal with situations involving uncertain or inconsistent information located in a distributed environment which cannot be combined into a single knowledge base.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we introduce an inquiry dialogue approach based on a combination of possibilistic logic and a formal argumentation-based theory, where possibilistic logic is used to capture uncertain information, and the argumentation-based approach is used to deal with inconsistent knowledge in a distributed environment.	Semantic Scholar
We also modify the framework of earlier work, so that the system is not only easier to implement but also more suitable for educational purposes.	Semantic Scholar
The suggested approach is implemented in a clinical decision-support system in the domain of dementia diagnosis.	Semantic Scholar
The approach allows the physician to suggest a hypothetical diagnosis in a patient case, which is verified through the dialogue if sufficient patient information is present.	Semantic Scholar
If not, the user is informed about the missing information and potential inconsistencies in the information as a way to provide support for continuing medical education.	Semantic Scholar
The approach is presented, discussed, and applied to one scenario.	Semantic Scholar
The results contribute to the theory and application of inquiry dialogues in situations where the data are uncertain and inconsistent.	Semantic Scholar
7 This work investigates the problem of robust vision-based h uman tracking by a human following robot using using point-based features like SURF .	Semantic Scholar
The problem is challenging owing to failures arising because of variation in illumi nation, change in pose, size or scale, camera motion and partial or full occlusion.	Semantic Scholar
While po int-based features provide robust detection against photometric and geometric distor t ons, the tracking of these features over subsequent frames becomes difficult as the num ber of matching points between a pair of images drops quickly with slight variation in target attribute owing to above mentioned variations.	Semantic Scholar
The problem of robust human t racking by the robot is solved by proposing a multi-tracker fusion framework tha t allows one to combine multiple tracker to ensure long term tracking of the target.	Semantic Scholar
This fusion framework also allows for creating a dynamic template pool of target featur es which gets updated over time.	Semantic Scholar
The interaction between the first two trackers is used t o update the template pool of the target attribute while the last tracker is used to esti mate the location of the target in case of full occlusion.	Semantic Scholar
The working of the framework is dem onstrated by combining a SURF-based mean-shift tracker, an optical-flow tracker an d a Kalman filter to provide robust tracking over a long time.	Semantic Scholar
The efficacy of the resultin g racker is demonstrated through rigorous testing on a variety of video datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Underactuated systems offer compact design with easy actuation and control but at the cost of limited stable configurations and reduced dexterity compared to the directly driven and fully actuated systems.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we propose a compact origami-based design in which we can modulate the material stiffness of the joints and thereby control the stable configurations and the overall stiffness in an underactuated robot.	Semantic Scholar
The robotic origami, robogami, design uses multiple functional layers in nominally two-dimensional robots to achieve the desired functionality.	Semantic Scholar
To control the stiffness of the structure, we adjust the elastic modulus of a shape memory polymer using an embedded customized stretchable heater.	Semantic Scholar
We study the actuation of a robogami finger with three joints and determine its stable configurations and contact forces at different stiffness settings.	Semantic Scholar
We monitor the configuration of the finger using feedback from customized curvature sensors embedded in each joint.	Semantic Scholar
A scaled down version of the design is used in a two-fingered gripper and different grasp modes are achieved by activating different sets of joints.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a novel method for retargeting human motions onto a humanoid robot.	Semantic Scholar
The method solves the following three simultaneous problems: the geometric parameter identification that morphs the human model to the robot model, motion planning for a robot, and the inverse kinematics of the human motion-capture data.	Semantic Scholar
Simultaneous solutions can imitate the original motion more accurately than conventional approaches, which solve the problems sequentially.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method can reconstruct the human motion within the physical constraints imposed by robot dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
A reconstruction step enables quantitative analysis of the retargeting results through direct comparison with the original human motion.	Semantic Scholar
The method can also provide the precise morphing function as well as subject-specific models, which can handle the different body dimensions of human subjects.	Semantic Scholar
This new framework is suitable for applications that require an accurate generation of human-like motions with quantitative evaluation criteria, such as humanoid robots that evaluate assistive devices.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental tests of the proposed method were performed with humanoid robot HRP-4.	Semantic Scholar
The dynamics of supervised learning play a main role in deep learning, which takes place in the parameter space of a multilayer perceptron (MLP).	Semantic Scholar
We review the history of supervised stochastic gradient learning, focusing on its singular structure and natural gradient.	Semantic Scholar
The parameter space includes singular regions in which parameters are not identifiable.	Semantic Scholar
One of our results is a full exploration of the dynamical behaviors of stochastic gradient learning in an elementary singular network.	Semantic Scholar
The bad news is its pathological nature, in which part of the singular region becomes an attractor and another part a repulser at the same time, forming a Milnor attractor.	Semantic Scholar
A learning trajectory is attracted by the attractor region, staying in it for a long time, before it escapes the singular region through the repulser region.	Semantic Scholar
This is typical of plateau phenomena in learning.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the strange topology of a singular region by introducing blow-down coordinates, which are useful for analyzing the natural gradient dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
We confirm that the natural gradient dynamics are free of critical slowdown.	Semantic Scholar
The second main result is the good news: the interactions of elementary singular networks eliminate the attractor part and the Milnor-type attractors disappear.	Semantic Scholar
This explains why large-scale networks do not suffer from serious critical slowdowns due to singularities.	Semantic Scholar
We finally show that the unit-wise natural gradient is effective for learning in spite of its low computational cost.	Semantic Scholar
Steerable wheeled mobile robots are able to perform arbitrary three-dimensional (3-D) planar trajectories, only after initializing the steer joint vector to the proper values.	Semantic Scholar
These robots employ fully steerable conventional wheels.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, they have higher load carrying capacity than their holonomic counterparts, and as such are preferable for industrial applications.	Semantic Scholar
Industrial setups nowadays are being prepared for the emerging field of human–robot collaboration/cooperation.	Semantic Scholar
Such field is highly dynamic, due to fast moving human workers, sharing the operation space.	Semantic Scholar
This imposes the need for human safe trajectory generators that can lead to frequent halts in motion, replanning, and to sudden, discontinuous changes in the position of the robot's instantaneous center of rotation (ICR).	Semantic Scholar
Indeed, this requires steer joint reconfiguration to the newly computed trajectory.	Semantic Scholar
This issue is almost ignored in the literature and motivates this work.	Semantic Scholar
The authors propose a new ICR-based kinematic controller, that is capable of handling discontinuity in commanded velocity while respecting the maximum joint performance limit.	Semantic Scholar
This is done by formulating a quadratic optimization problem with linear constraints in the 2-D ICR space.	Semantic Scholar
The controller is also robust against representation and kinematic singularities.	Semantic Scholar
It has been tested successfully on the Neobotix-MPO700 industrial mobile robot.	Semantic Scholar
Ostraciiform body/caudal fish locomotion requires high-frequency oscillation of the caudal fin, yielding negligible body oscillations.	Semantic Scholar
It is the most ideal form of biomimetic locomotion for underwater robots where body-stabilization is required for photography or manipulation applications.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a two-segment caudal fin design with substantial improvements over existing single-segment fins.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed fin helped reducing drag, increasing resonant frequency, and achieving a wide controllable range of thrust forces.	Semantic Scholar
The design, modeling, fabrication, and validation of an Ostraciiform robot with the proposed caudal fin are presented in detail.	Semantic Scholar
Over 1200 test trials on six fin designs were compared, showing nearly three-times higher resonant frequency and 12% thrust force increase over single-segment homogeneous fin.	Semantic Scholar
It is also demonstrated that the peak frequency could be selected via mechanical fin designs, enabling customized caudal fin design according to applications.	Semantic Scholar
Working with large swarms of robots has challenges in calibration, sensing, tracking, and control due to the associated scalability and time requirements.	Semantic Scholar
Kilobots solve this through their ease of maintenance and programming, and are widely used in several research laboratories worldwide where their low cost enables large-scale swarms studies.	Semantic Scholar
However, the small, inexpensive nature of the Kilobots limits their range of capabilities as they are only equipped with a single sensor.	Semantic Scholar
In some studies, this limitation can be a source of motivation and inspiration, while in others it is an impediment.	Semantic Scholar
As such, we designed, implemented, and tested a novel system to communicate personalized location-and-state-based information to each robot, and receive information on each robots’ state.	Semantic Scholar
In this way, the Kilobots can sense additional information from a virtual environment in real time; for example, a value on a gradient, a direction toward a reference point or a pheromone trail.	Semantic Scholar
The augmented reality for Kilobots ( ARK) system implements this in flexible base control software which allows users to define varying virtual environments within a single experiment using integrated overhead tracking and control.	Semantic Scholar
We showcase the different functionalities of the system through three demos involving hundreds of Kilobots.	Semantic Scholar
The ARK  provides Kilobots with additional and unique capabilities through an open-source tool which can be implemented with inexpensive, off-the-shelf hardware.	Semantic Scholar
Online display advertising has becomes a billion-dollar industry, and it keeps growing.	Semantic Scholar
Advertisers attempt to send marketing messages to attract potential customers via graphic banner ads on publishers’ webpages.	Semantic Scholar
Advertisers are charged for each view of a page that delivers their display ads.	Semantic Scholar
However, recent studies have discovered that more than half of the ads are never shown on users’ screens due to insufficient scrolling.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, advertisers waste a great amount of money on these ads that do not bring any return on investment.	Semantic Scholar
Given this situation, the Interactive Advertising Bureau calls for a shift toward charging by viewable impression, i.e., charge for ads that are viewed by users.	Semantic Scholar
With this new pricing model, it is helpful to predict the viewability of an ad.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes two probabilistic latent class models (PLC) that predict the viewability of any given scroll depth for a user-page pair.	Semantic Scholar
Using a real-life dataset from a large publisher, the experiments demonstrate that our models outperform comparison systems.	Semantic Scholar
The mathematical relation between a vector electric field and its corresponding scalar potential field is useful to formulate computational problems of lower/middle-order visual processing, specifically related to the assignment of borders to the side of the object: so-called border ownership (BO).	Semantic Scholar
BO coding is a key process for extracting the objects from the background, allowing one to organize a cluttered scene.	Semantic Scholar
"We propose that the problem is solvable simultaneously by application of a theorem of electromagnetism, i.e., ""conservative vector fields have zero rotation, or ""curl."""	Semantic Scholar
We hypothesize that (i) the BO signal is definable as a vector electric field with arrowheads pointing to the inner side of perceived objects, and (ii) its corresponding scalar field carries information related to perceived order in depth of occluding/occluded objects.	Semantic Scholar
A simple model was developed based on this computational theory.	Semantic Scholar
Model results qualitatively agree with object-side selectivity of BO-coding neurons, and with perceptions of object order.	Semantic Scholar
The model update rule can be reproduced as a plausible neural network that presents new interpretations of existing physiological results.	Semantic Scholar
Results of this study also suggest that T-junction detectors are unnecessary to calculate depth order.	Semantic Scholar
We describe a method for verifying the temporal property of persistence in non-linear hybrid systems.	Semantic Scholar
Given some system and an initial set of states, the method establishes that system trajectories always eventually evolve into some specified target subset of the states of one of the discrete modes of the system, and always remain within this target region.	Semantic Scholar
The method also computes a time-bound within which the target region is always reached.	Semantic Scholar
The approach combines flowpipe computation with deductive reasoning about invariants and is more general than each technique alone.	Semantic Scholar
We illustrate the method with a case study showing that potentially destructive stick-slip oscillations of an oil-well drill eventually die away for a certain choice of drill control parameters.	Semantic Scholar
The case study demonstrates how just using flowpipes or just reasoning about invariants alone can be insufficient and shows the richness of systems that one can handle with the proposed method, since the systems features modes with non-polynomial ODEs.	Semantic Scholar
We also propose an alternative method for proving persistence that relies solely on flowpipe computation.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a new, simple, and efficient strategy for locomotion classification using a force myography (FMG) system developed in-house.	Semantic Scholar
The FMG signals were acquired from eight calibrated force sensors.	Semantic Scholar
These sensors were wrapped around the thigh and captured volumetric changes in thigh muscles during locomotion.	Semantic Scholar
The data were collected from eight able-bodied subjects and two unilateral transfemoral amputees while walking in different terrains, i.e., level walk, ramp ascent, ramp descent, stair ascent, and stair descent (SD).	Semantic Scholar
The repeatability of FMG signals within all the five locomotion modes was expressed in terms of variance ratio (VR).	Semantic Scholar
For all locomotion modes, except SD, the VR ranges from 0.1 to 0.3, showing high repeatability within the locomotion modes for able-bodied and amputee subjects.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, these locomotion modes are characterized by computationally simplified time-domain features of FMG signals and classified using linear discriminant analysis (LDA).	Semantic Scholar
"The subject-dependent LDA model gave an average classification accuracy of 99.5% (<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">${\text{SD}}\,= \,{\text{0.5}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) and 96.1% (<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">${\text{SD}}\,= \,{\text{1.9}}$</tex-math></inline-formula>) for able-bodied and amputee subjects, respectively."	Semantic Scholar
These results show the potential of the FMG system in a real-time classification of locomotion modes for lower-limb prosthetic control.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a method to design tendon-driven underactuated hands whose fingertips can track a predefined trajectory, when actuated.	Semantic Scholar
We focus on passively compliant hands composed of deformable joints and rigid links.	Semantic Scholar
We first introduce a procedure to determine suitable joints stiffness and tendon routing, then a possible realization of a robotic underactuated finger is shown.	Semantic Scholar
The kinematic and kinetostatic analysis of a tendon-driven robotic finger is necessary to define the overall stiffness values of the finger joints.	Semantic Scholar
A structural analysis of the element constituting each passive joint allowed to define a relation between the stiffness and joint's main dimensional and material properties.	Semantic Scholar
We validated the proposed framework both in simulation and with experiments using the robotic Soft-SixthFinger as a case study.	Semantic Scholar
The Soft-SixthFinger is a wearable robot for grasping compensation in patients with a paretic hand.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrated that different fingertip trajectories can be achieved when joint stiffness and tendon routing are properly designed.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we demonstrated that the device is able to grasp a wider set of objects when a specific finger flexion trajectory is designed.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed framework is general and can be applied to robotic hands with an arbitrary number of fingers and joints per finger.	Semantic Scholar
The modular approach furthermore allows the user to easily customize the hand according to specific tasks or trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework which formalizes user-driven customization of shared autonomy in assistive robotics as a nonlinear optimization problem.	Semantic Scholar
Our insight is to allow the end-user, rather than relying on standard optimization techniques, to perform the optimization procedure, thereby allowing us to leave the exact nature of the cost function indeterminate.	Semantic Scholar
We ground our formalism with an interactive optimization procedure that customizes control sharing using an assistive robotic arm.	Semantic Scholar
We also present a pilot study that explores interactive optimization with end-users.	Semantic Scholar
This study was performed with 17 subjects (4 with spinal cord injury, 13 without injury).	Semantic Scholar
Results show all subjects were able to converge to an assistance paradigm, suggesting the existence of optimal solutions.	Semantic Scholar
Notably, the amount of assistance was not always optimized for task performance.	Semantic Scholar
Instead, some subjects favored retaining more control during the execution over better task performance.	Semantic Scholar
The study supports the case for user-driven customization and provides guidance for its continued development and study.	Semantic Scholar
Supergraph search is a fundamental problem in graph databases that is widely applied in many application scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
Given a graph database and a query-graph, supergraph search retrieves all data-graphs contained in the query-graph from the graph database.	Semantic Scholar
Most existing solutions for supergraph search follow the pruning-and-verification framework, which prune false answers based on features in the pruning phase and perform subgraph isomorphism testings on the remaining graphs in the verification phase.	Semantic Scholar
However, they are not scalable to handle large-sized data-graphs and query-graphs due to three drawbacks.	Semantic Scholar
First, they rely on a frequent subgraph mining algorithm to select features which is expensive and cannot generate large features.	Semantic Scholar
Second, they require a costly verification phase.	Semantic Scholar
Third, they process features in a fixed order without considering their relationships to the query-graph.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we address the three drawbacks and propose new indexing and query processing algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
In indexing, we select features directly from the data-graphs without expensive frequent subgraph mining.	Semantic Scholar
The features form a feature-tree that contains all-sized features and both the cost sharing and pruning power of the features are considered.	Semantic Scholar
In query processing, we propose a new algorithm, where the order to process features is query-dependent by considering both the cost sharing and the pruning power.	Semantic Scholar
We explore two optimization strategies to further improve the algorithm efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
The first strategy applies a lightweight graph compression technique and the second strategy optimizes the inclusion of answers.	Semantic Scholar
We further introduce how to efficiently maintain the index incrementally when the graph database is updated dynamically.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we propose an approximation approach to significantly reduce the computational cost for large data-graphs and/or query-graphs while preserving a high result quality.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we conduct extensive performance studies on two real large datasets to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Robust and accurate visual-inertial estimation is crucial to many of today's challenges in robotics.	Semantic Scholar
Being able to localize against a prior map and obtain accurate and drift-free pose estimates can push the applicability of such systems even further.	Semantic Scholar
Most of the currently available solutions, however, either focus on a single session use case, lack localization capabilities, or do not provide an end-to-end pipeline.	Semantic Scholar
We believe that only a complete system, combining state-of-the-art algorithms, scalable multisession mapping tools, and a flexible user interface, can become an efficient research platform.	Semantic Scholar
We, therefore, present maplab, an open, research-oriented visual-inertial mapping framework for processing and manipulating multisession maps, written in C++.	Semantic Scholar
On the one hand, maplab can be seen as a ready-to-use visual-inertial mapping and localization system.	Semantic Scholar
On the other hand, maplab provides the research community with a collection of multisession mapping tools that include map merging, visual-inertial batch optimization, and loop closure.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, it includes an online frontend that can create visual-inertial maps and also track a global drift-free pose within a localization map.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present the system architecture, five use cases, and evaluations of the system on public datasets.	Semantic Scholar
The source code of maplab is freely available for the benefit of the robotics research community.	Semantic Scholar
Motion planning in multicontact scenarios has recently gathered interest within the legged robotics community, however actuator force/torque limits are rarely considered.	Semantic Scholar
We believe that these limits gain paramount importance when the complexity of the terrains to be traversed increases.	Semantic Scholar
We build on previous research from the field of robotic grasping to propose two new six-dimensional bounded polytopes named the Actuation Wrench Polytope (AWP) and the Feasible Wrench Polytope (FWP).	Semantic Scholar
We define theAWP as the set of all the wrenches that a robot can generate while considering its actuation limits.	Semantic Scholar
This considers the admissible contact forces that the robot can generate given its current configuration and actuation capabilities.	Semantic Scholar
The Contact Wrench Cone (CWC) instead includes features of the environment such as the contact normal or the friction coefficient.	Semantic Scholar
The intersection of the AWP and of the CWC results in a convex polytope, the FWP, which turns out to be more descriptive of the real robot capabilities than existing simplified models, while maintaining the same compact representation.	Semantic Scholar
We explain how to efficiently compute the vertex-description of the FWP that is then used to evaluate a feasibility factor that we adapted from the field of robotic grasping.	Semantic Scholar
This allows us to optimize for robustness to external disturbance wrenches.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this, we present an implementation of a motion planner for our quadruped robot HyQ that provides online  Center of Mass trajectories that are guaranteed to be statically stable and actuation-consistent.	Semantic Scholar
In the literature, two series of models have been proposed to address prediction problems including classification and regression.	Semantic Scholar
Simple models, such as generalized linear models, have ordinary performance but strong interpretability on a set of simple features.	Semantic Scholar
The other series, including tree-based models, organize numerical, categorical, and high dimensional features into a comprehensive structure with rich interpretable information in the data.	Semantic Scholar

This paper provides new theoretical results on the multistability and instability analysis of recurrent neural networks with time-varying delays.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown that such n-neuronal recurrent neural networks have exactly [Formula: see text] equilibria, [Formula: see text] of which are locally exponentially stable and the others are unstable, where k0 is a nonnegative integer such that k0≤n.	Semantic Scholar
By using the combination method of two different divisions, recurrent neural networks can possess more dynamic properties.	Semantic Scholar
This method improves and extends the existing results in the literature.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, one numerical example is provided to show the superiority and effectiveness of the presented results.	Semantic Scholar
A characterization of a pervasive system of systems (SoS) called the SmartPowerchair is presented, integrating pervasive technologies into a standard powered wheelchair (powerchair).	Semantic Scholar
The SmartPowerchair can be characterized as a SoS due to focusing on selection of the correct combination of independent and interoperable systems that are networked for a period of time to achieve the specific overall goal of enhancing the quality of life for people with disability.	Semantic Scholar
A high-level 2-D SoS model for the SmartPowerchair is developed to illustrate the different SoS lifecycle stages and levels.	Semantic Scholar
The results from a requirements elicitation study consisting of a survey targeting powerchair users were the input to a hierarchical task analysis defining the supported tasks of the SmartPowerchair.	Semantic Scholar
The system architecture of one constituent system (SmartATRS) is described as well as the results of a usability evaluation containing workload measurements.	Semantic Scholar
The establishment of the SmartAbility framework was the outcome of the evaluation results that concluded range of movement (ROM) was the determinant of suitable technologies for people with disability.	Semantic Scholar
The framework illustrates how a SoS approach can be applied to disability to recommend interaction mediums, technologies, and tasks depending on the disability, impairments, and ROM of the user.	Semantic Scholar
The approach, therefore, creates a “recommender system” by viewing disability type, impairments, ROM, interaction medium, technologies, and tasks as constituent systems that interact together in a SoS.	Semantic Scholar
A system for automatically pointing ultrasound (US) imaging catheters will enable clinicians to monitor anatomical structures and track instruments during interventional procedures.	Semantic Scholar
Off-the-shelf US catheters provide high-quality US images from within the patient.	Semantic Scholar
While this method of imaging has been proven to be effective for guiding many interventional treatments, significant training is required to overcome the difficulty in manually steering the imager to point at desired structures.	Semantic Scholar
Our system uses closed-form four degree-of-freedom (DOF) kinematic solutions to automatically position the US catheter and point the imager.	Semantic Scholar
Algorithms for steering and imager pointing were developed for a range of useful diagnostic and interventional motions.	Semantic Scholar
The system was validated on a robotic test bed by steering the catheter within a water environment containing phantom objects.	Semantic Scholar
While the system described here was designed for pointing US catheters, these algorithms are applicable to accurate 4-DOF steering and orientation control of any long thin tendon-driven tool with single or bidirectional bending.	Semantic Scholar
Building bilateral semantic associations between images and texts is among the fundamental problems in computer vision.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study two complementary cross-modal prediction tasks: (i) predicting text(s) given a query image (“Im2Text”), and (ii) predicting image(s) given a piece of text (“Text2Im”).	Semantic Scholar
We make no assumption on the specific form of text; i.e., it could be either a set of labels, phrases, or even captions.	Semantic Scholar
We pose both these tasks in a retrieval framework.	Semantic Scholar
For Im2Text, given a query image, our goal is to retrieve a ranked list of semantically relevant texts from an independent text-corpus (i.e., texts with no corresponding images).	Semantic Scholar
Similarly, for Text2Im, given a query text, we aim to retrieve a ranked list of semantically relevant images from a collection of unannotated images (i.e., images without any associated textual meta-data).	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel Structural SVM based unified framework for these two tasks, and show how it can be efficiently trained and tested.	Semantic Scholar
Using a variety of loss functions, extensive experiments are conducted on three popular datasets (two medium-scale datasets containing few thousands of samples, and one web-scale dataset containing one million samples).	Semantic Scholar
Experiments demonstrate that our framework gives promising results compared to competing baseline cross-modal search techniques, thus confirming its efficacy.	Semantic Scholar
To ensure that a robot is able to accomplish an extensive range of tasks, it is necessary to achieve a flexible combination of multiple behaviors.	Semantic Scholar
This is because the design of task motions suited to each situation would become increasingly difficult as the number of situations and the types of tasks performed by them increase.	Semantic Scholar
To handle the switching and combination of multiple behaviors, we propose a method to design dynamical systems based on point attractors that accept (i) “instruction signals” for instruction-driven switching.	Semantic Scholar
We incorporate the (ii) “instruction phase” to form a point attractor and divide the target task into multiple subtasks.	Semantic Scholar
By forming an instruction phase that consists of point attractors, the model embeds a subtask in the form of trajectory dynamics that can be manipulated using sensory and instruction signals.	Semantic Scholar
Our model comprises two deep neural networks: A convolutional autoencoder and a multiple time-scale recurrent neural network.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we apply the proposed method to manipulate soft materials.	Semantic Scholar
To evaluate our model, we design a cloth-folding task that consists of four subtasks and three patterns of instruction signals, which indicate the direction of motion.	Semantic Scholar
The results depict that the robot can perform the required task by combining subtasks based on sensory and instruction signals.	Semantic Scholar
And, our model determined the relations among these signals using its internal dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
An ongoing challenge in the rapidly evolving app market ecosystem is to maintain the integrity of app categories.	Semantic Scholar
At the time of registration, app developers have to select, what they believe, is the most appropriate category for their apps.	Semantic Scholar
Besides the inherent ambiguity of selecting the right category, the approach leaves open the possibility of misuse and potential gaming by the registrant.	Semantic Scholar
Periodically, the app store will refine the list of categories available and potentially reassign the apps.	Semantic Scholar
However, it has been observed that the mismatch between the description of the app and the category it belongs to, continues to persist.	Semantic Scholar
Although some common mechanisms (e.g., a complaint-driven or manual checking) exist, they limit the response time to detect miscategorized apps and still open the challenge on categorization.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce FRAC+: (FR)amework for (A)pp (C)ategorization.	Semantic Scholar
FRAC+ has the following salient features: (i) it is based on a data-driven topic model and automatically suggests the categories appropriate for the app store, and (ii) it can detect miscategorizated apps.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments attest to the performance of FRAC+.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on Google Play shows that FRAC+’s topics are more aligned with Google’s new categories and 0.35-1.10 percent game apps are detected to be miscategorized.	Semantic Scholar
Multiway array decomposition methods have been shown to be promising statistical tools for identifying neural activity in the EEG spectrum.	Semantic Scholar
They blindly decompose the EEG spectrum into spatial-temporal-spectral patterns by taking into account inherent relationships among signals acquired at different frequencies and sensors.	Semantic Scholar
Our study evaluates the stability of spatial-temporal-spectral patterns derived by one particular method, parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC).	Semantic Scholar
We focused on patterns’ stability over time and in population and divided the complete data set containing data from 50 healthy subjects into several subsets.	Semantic Scholar
Our results suggest that the patterns are highly stable in time, as well as among different subgroups of subjects.	Semantic Scholar
Further, we show with simultaneously acquired fMRI data that power fluctuations of some patterns have stable correspondence to hemodynamic fluctuations in large-scale brain networks.	Semantic Scholar
We did not find such correspondence for power fluctuations in standard frequency bands, the common way of dealing with EEG data.	Semantic Scholar
Altogether, our results suggest that PARAFAC is a suitable method for research in the field of large-scale brain networks and their manifestation in EEG signal.	Semantic Scholar
Unmanned blimps are a safe and reliable alternative to conventional drones when flying above people.	Semantic Scholar
On-board real-time tracking of their pose and velocities is a necessary step toward autonomous navigation.	Semantic Scholar
There is a need for an easily deployable technology that is able to accurately and robustly estimate the pose and velocities of a blimp in 6 DOF, as well as unexpected applied forces and torques, in an uncontrolled environment.	Semantic Scholar
We present two multiplicative extended Kalman filters using ultrawideband radio sensors and a gyroscope to address this challenge.	Semantic Scholar
One filter is updated using a dynamics model of the blimp, whereas the other uses a constant speed model.	Semantic Scholar
We describe a set of experiments in which these estimators have been implemented on an embedded flight controller.	Semantic Scholar
They were tested and compared in accuracy and robustness in a hardware-in-loop simulation as well as on a real blimp.	Semantic Scholar
This approach can be generalized to any lighter than air robot to track it with the necessary accuracy, precision, and robustness to allow autonomous navigation.	Semantic Scholar
This paper addresses the controller design problem for global fixed-time synchronization of delayed neural networks (DNNs) with discontinuous activations.	Semantic Scholar
To solve this problem, adaptive control and state feedback control laws are designed.	Semantic Scholar
Then based on the two controllers and two lemmas, the error system is proved to be globally asymptotically stable and even fixed-time stable.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, some sufficient and easy checked conditions are derived to guarantee the global synchronization of drive and response systems in fixed time.	Semantic Scholar
It is noted that the settling time functional for fixed-time synchronization is independent on initial conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Our fixed-time synchronization results contain the finite-time results as the special cases by choosing different values of the two controllers.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations.	Semantic Scholar
There are compelling computational models of many properties of the primate ventral visual stream, but a gap remains between the models and the physiology.	Semantic Scholar
To facilitate ongoing refinement of these models, we have compiled diverse information from the electrophysiology literature into a statistical model of inferotemporal (IT) cortex responses.	Semantic Scholar
This is a purely descriptive model, so it has little explanatory power.	Semantic Scholar
However it is able to directly incorporate a rich and extensible set of tuning properties.	Semantic Scholar
So far, we have approximated tuning curves and statistics of tuning diversity for occlusion, clutter, size, orientation, position, and object selectivity in early versus late response phases.	Semantic Scholar
We integrated the model with the V-REP simulator, which provides stimulus properties in a simulated physical environment.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast with the empirical model presented here, mechanistic models are ultimately more useful for understanding neural systems.	Semantic Scholar
However, a detailed empirical model may be useful as a source of labeled data for optimizing and validating mechanistic models, or as a source of input to models of other brain areas.	Semantic Scholar
Three-dimensional mapping of submerged industrial facilities or underwater sites with complex geometries is still a challenge for nowadays autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), which are restricted to more simple survey missions.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a complete framework to plan and execute autonomous missions to map a region of interest, coping with the particularities of the underwater domain.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed solution consists of the following steps: First, if a previous model is not available, a preliminary bathymetry of the area to be covered is gathered and an octree representation is created.	Semantic Scholar
Next, using this a priori model, an offline view-planner computes a minimum set of sensor configurations to cover the volume of interest by taking into account the mapping sensor and the vehicle safety constraints.	Semantic Scholar
It also computes the free path to be followed by the AUV to traverse all these sensor configurations.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the planned mission is executed while an online simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm prevents the AUV from drifting, ensuring that the planned path is correctly followed.	Semantic Scholar
Preliminary results regarding the view planner have been obtained in a shipwreck site with the Girona 500 AUV, while results involving the whole framework have been achieved using the Gazebo simulator and a realistic AUV model equipped with a multibeam sonar mounted on a pan & tilt unit.	Semantic Scholar
The muscle-synergy hypothesis is a widely used method for describing simple motion patterns and how the central nervous system deals with the complexity of controlling a large set of muscles in parallel.	Semantic Scholar
However, the physiological interpretation of synergies and the mathematical techniques behind their computation are still far from being properly standardized.	Semantic Scholar
This letter proposes a novel approach to obtaining detailed and accurate information about how muscular synergies are triggered during different stages of a given motion.	Semantic Scholar
In that regard, a way to find the number of muscle synergies working in parallel is introduced based on the appearance of unexpected high-frequencies in the time series of electromyographic (EMG) signals during synergy extraction.	Semantic Scholar
This phenomenon allows the definition of a robust threshold for the number of synergies.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed methods are tested on muscle synergies computed from superficial EMG signals recorded during wheel steering.	Semantic Scholar
The results show the advantage of the proposed approach in relation to the currently used methods that require segmenting the signal according to the stages of the movement, and suggest future increases in the understanding of motor control from a neurological point of view.	Semantic Scholar
An autonomous, adaptive, and intelligent electroadhesive material handling system has been presented in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
The system has been proposed and defined based on the identification of a system need through a comprehensive literature review and laboratory-based experimental tests.	Semantic Scholar
The proof of the proposed concept has been implemented by a low cost and novel electroadhesive pad design and manufacture process, and a mechatronic and reconfigurable platform, where force, humidity, and capacitive sensors have been employed.	Semantic Scholar
This provides a solution to an autonomous elelctroadhesive material handling system that is environmentally and substrate material adaptive.	Semantic Scholar
The results have shown that the minimum voltage can be applied to robustly grasp different materials under different environment conditions.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed system is particularly useful for pick-and-place applications where various types of materials and changing environments exist such as robotic material handling applications in the textile and waste recycling industry.	Semantic Scholar
Relational program reasoning is concerned with formally comparing pairs of executions of programs.	Semantic Scholar
Prominent examples of relational reasoning are program equivalence checking (which considers executions from different programs) and detecting illicit information flow (which considers two executions of the same program).	Semantic Scholar
The abstract logical foundations of relational reasoning are, by now, sufficiently well understood.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we address some of the challenges that remain to make the reasoning practicable.	Semantic Scholar
Two major ones are dealing with the feature richness of programming languages such as C and with the weakly structured control flow that many real-world programs exhibit.	Semantic Scholar
A popular approach to control this complexity is to define the analyses on the level of an intermediate program representation (IR) such as one generated by modern compilers.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we describe the ideas and insights behind IR-based relational verification.	Semantic Scholar
We present a program equivalence checker for C programs that operates on LLVM IR.	Semantic Scholar
To extend the reach of the approach and to make it more efficient, we show how dynamic analyses can be employed to support and strengthen the static verification.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by automatically verifying equivalence of functions from different implementations of the standard C library.	Semantic Scholar

We explore classifier training for data sets with very few labels.	Semantic Scholar
We investigate this task using a neural network for nonnegative data.	Semantic Scholar
The network is derived from a hierarchical normalized Poisson mixture model with one observed and two hidden layers.	Semantic Scholar
With the single objective of likelihood optimization, both labeled and unlabeled data are naturally incorporated into learning.	Semantic Scholar
The neural activation and learning equations resulting from our derivation are concise and local.	Semantic Scholar
As a consequence, the network can be scaled using standard deep learning tools for parallelized GPU implementation.	Semantic Scholar
Using standard benchmarks for nonnegative data, such as text document representations, MNIST, and NIST SD19, we study the classification performance when very few labels are used for training.	Semantic Scholar
In different settings, the network's performance is compared to standard and recently suggested semisupervised classifiers.	Semantic Scholar
While other recent approaches are more competitive for many labels or fully labeled data sets, we find that the network studied here can be applied to numbers of few labels where no other system has been reported to operate so far.	Semantic Scholar

Multilayer bootstrap network builds a gradually narrowed multilayer nonlinear network from bottom up for unsupervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction.	Semantic Scholar
Each layer of the network is a nonparametric density estimator.	Semantic Scholar
It consists of a group of k-centroids clusterings.	Semantic Scholar
Each clustering randomly selects data points with randomly selected features as its centroids, and learns a one-hot encoder by one-nearest-neighbor optimization.	Semantic Scholar
Geometrically, the nonparametric density estimator at each layer projects the input data space to a uniformly-distributed discrete feature space, where the similarity of two data points in the discrete feature space is measured by the number of the nearest centroids they share in common.	Semantic Scholar
The multilayer network gradually reduces the nonlinear variations of data from bottom up by building a vast number of hierarchical trees implicitly on the original data space.	Semantic Scholar
Theoretically, the estimation error caused by the nonparametric density estimator is proportional to the correlation between the clusterings, both of which are reduced by the randomization steps.	Semantic Scholar
This manuscript introduces the end-to-end embedding of a CNN into a HMM, while interpreting the outputs of the CNN in a Bayesian framework.	Semantic Scholar
The hybrid CNN-HMM combines the strong discriminative abilities of CNNs with the sequence modelling capabilities of HMMs.	Semantic Scholar
Most current approaches in the field of gesture and sign language recognition disregard the necessity of dealing with sequence data both for training and evaluation.	Semantic Scholar
With our presented end-to-end embedding we are able to improve over the state-of-the-art on three challenging benchmark continuous sign language recognition tasks by between 15 and 38% relative reduction in word error rate and up to 20% absolute.	Semantic Scholar
We analyse the effect of the CNN structure, network pretraining and number of hidden states.	Semantic Scholar
We compare the hybrid modelling to a tandem approach and evaluate the gain of model combination.	Semantic Scholar
A neuronal population is a computational unit that receives a multivariate, time-varying input signal and creates a related multivariate output.	Semantic Scholar
These neural signals are modeled as stochastic processes that transmit information in real time, subject to stochastic noise.	Semantic Scholar
In a stationary environment, where the input signals can be characterized by constant statistical properties, the systematic relationship between its input and output processes determines the computation carried out by a population.	Semantic Scholar
When these statistical characteristics unexpectedly change, the population needs to adapt to its new environment if it is to maintain stable operation.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the general concept of homeostatic plasticity, we propose a simple compositional model of adaptive networks that achieve invariance with regard to undesired changes in the statistical properties of their input signals and maintain outputs with well-defined joint statistics.	Semantic Scholar
To achieve such invariance, the network model combines two functionally distinct types of plasticity.	Semantic Scholar
An abstract stochastic process neuron model implements a generalized form of intrinsic plasticity that adapts marginal statistics, relying only on mechanisms locally confined within each neuron and operating continuously in time, while a simple form of Hebbian synaptic plasticity operates on synaptic connections, thus shaping the interrelation between neurons as captured by a copula function.	Semantic Scholar
The combined effect of both mechanisms allows a neuron population to discover invariant representations of its inputs that remain stable under a wide range of transformations (e.g., shifting, scaling and (affine linear) mixing).	Semantic Scholar
The probabilistic model of homeostatic adaptation on a population level as presented here allows us to isolate and study the individual and the interaction dynamics of both mechanisms of plasticity and could guide the future search for computationally beneficial types of adaptation.

This letter presents a novel controller for robotic hands, which regulates the grasp stiffness by manipulating the pose and the finger joint stiffness of hands with multiple degrees of freedom while guaranteeing grasp stability.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach is inspired by the observations of human motor behavior, which reveal a coordinated pattern of stiffening among the hand fingers, along with a predictive selection of the hand pose to achieve a reliable grasp.	Semantic Scholar
The first adjusts the magnitude of the grasp stiffness, while the latter manipulates its overall geometry (shape).	Semantic Scholar
The realization of a similar control approach in robotic hands can result in a reduction of the software complexity and also promote a novel mechanical design approach, in which the finger stiffness profiles of the hand are adjusted by only one active component.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed control is validated with a fully actuated Allegro Hand, while trying to achieve predefined grasp stiffness profiles or modifications of an initial one.	Semantic Scholar
Blind image deconvolution is one of the main low-level vision problems with wide applications.	Semantic Scholar
Many previous works manually design regularization to simultaneously estimate the latent sharp image and the blur kernel under maximum a posterior framework.	Semantic Scholar
However, it has been demonstrated that such joint estimation strategies may lead to the undesired trivial solution.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a novel perspective, using a stable feedback control system, to simulate the latent sharp image propagation.	Semantic Scholar
The controller of our system consists of regularization and guidance, which decide the sparsity and sharp features of latent image, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the formational model of blind image is introduced into the feedback process to avoid the image restoration deviating from the stable point.	Semantic Scholar
The stability analysis of the system indicates the latent image propagation in blind deconvolution task can be efficiently estimated and controlled by cues and priors.	Semantic Scholar
Thus the kernel estimation used for image restoration becomes more precision.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that our system is effective on image propagation, and can perform favorably against the state-of-the-art blind image deconvolution methods on different benchmark image sets and special blurred images.	Semantic Scholar
Many classification tasks require both labeling objects and determining label associations for parts of each object.	Semantic Scholar
Example applications include labeling segments of images or determining relevant parts of a text document when the training labels are available only at the image or document level.	Semantic Scholar
This task is usually referred to as multi-instance (MI) learning, where the learner typically receives a collection of labeled (or sometimes unlabeled) bags, each containing several segments (instances).	Semantic Scholar
We propose a semisupervised MI learning method for multilabel classification.	Semantic Scholar
Most MI learning methods treat instances in each bag as independent and identically distributed samples.	Semantic Scholar
However, in many practical applications, instances are related to each other and should not be considered independent.	Semantic Scholar
Our model discovers a latent low-dimensional space that captures structure within each bag.	Semantic Scholar
Further, unlike many other MI learning methods, which are primarily developed for binary classification, we model multiple classes jointly, thus also capturing possible dependencies between different classes.	Semantic Scholar
We develop our model within a semisupervised framework, which leverages both labeled and, typically, a larger set of unlabeled bags for training.	Semantic Scholar
We develop several efficient inference methods for our model.	Semantic Scholar
We first introduce a Markov chain Monte Carlo method for inference, which can handle arbitrary relations between bag labels and instance labels, including the standard hard-max MI assumption.	Semantic Scholar
We also develop an extension of our model that uses stochastic variational Bayes methods for inference, and thus scales better to massive data sets.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments show that our approach outperforms several MI learning and standard classification methods on both bag-level and instance-level label prediction.	Semantic Scholar
All code for replicating our experiments is available from https://github.com/hsoleimani/MLTM.	Semantic Scholar
We present an automatic approach for the task of reconstructing a 2-D floor plan from unstructured point clouds of building interiors.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach emphasizes accurate and robust detection of building structural elements and, unlike previous approaches, does not require prior knowledge of scanning device poses.	Semantic Scholar
The reconstruction task is formulated as a multiclass labeling problem that we approach using energy minimization.	Semantic Scholar
We use intuitive priors to define the costs for the energy minimization problem and rely on accurate wall and opening detection algorithms to ensure robustness.	Semantic Scholar
We provide detailed experimental evaluation results, both qualitative and quantitative, against state-of-the-art methods and labeled ground-truth data.	Semantic Scholar

There are various kinds of brain monitoring techniques, including local field potential, near-infrared spectroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography, functional MRI, electroencephalography (EEG), and magnetoencephalography.	Semantic Scholar
Among those techniques, EEG is the most widely used one due to its portability, low setup cost, and noninvasiveness.	Semantic Scholar
Apart from other advantages, EEG signals also help to evaluate the ability of the smelling organ.	Semantic Scholar
In such studies, EEG signals, which are recorded during smelling, are analyzed to determine the subject lacks any smelling ability or to measure the response of the brain.	Semantic Scholar
The main idea of this study is to show the emotional difference in EEG signals during perception of valerian, lotus flower, cheese, and rosewater odors by the EEG gamma wave.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method was applied to the EEG signals, which were taken from five healthy subjects in the conditions of eyes open and eyes closed at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.	Semantic Scholar
In order to represent the signals, we extracted features from the gamma band of the EEG trials by continuous wavelet transform with the selection of Morlet as a wavelet function.	Semantic Scholar
Then the -nearest neighbor algorithm was implemented as the classifier for recognizing the EEG trials as valerian, lotus flower, cheese, and rosewater.	Semantic Scholar
We achieved an average classification accuracy rate of 87.50% with the 4.3 standard deviation value for the subjects in eyes-open condition and an average classification accuracy rate of 94.12% with the 2.9 standard deviation value for the subjects in eyes-closed condition.	Semantic Scholar
The results prove that the proposed continuous wavelet transform–based feature extraction method has great potential to classify the EEG signals recorded during smelling of the present odors.	Semantic Scholar
It has been also established that gamma-band activity of the brain is highly associated with olfaction.	Semantic Scholar
This letter combines the fast zero-moment-point approaches that work well in practice with the broader range of capabilities of a trajectory optimization formulation, by optimizing over body motion, footholds, and center of pressure simultaneously.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce a vertex-based representation of the support-area constraint, which can treat arbitrarily oriented point-, line-, and area-contacts uniformly.	Semantic Scholar
This generalization allows us to create motions, such as quadrupedal walking, trotting, bounding, pacing, combinations, and transitions between these, limping, bipedal walking, and push recovery all with the same approach.	Semantic Scholar
This formulation constitutes a minimal representation of the physical laws (unilateral contact forces) and kinematic restrictions (range of motion) in legged locomotion, which allows us to generate diverse motions in less than a second.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the feasibility of the generated motions on a real quadruped robot.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce a method for modeling a configuration of objects in 2D or 3D images using a mathematical “skeletal linking structure” which will simultaneously capture the individual shape features of the objects and their positional information relative to one another.	Semantic Scholar
The objects may either have smooth boundaries and be disjoint from the others or share common portions of their boundaries with other objects in a piecewise smooth manner.	Semantic Scholar
These structures include a special class of “Blum medial linking structures”, which are intrinsically associated to the configuration and build upon the Blum medial axes of the individual objects.	Semantic Scholar
We give a classification of the properties of Blum linking structures for generic configurations.	Semantic Scholar
The skeletal linking structures add increased flexibility for modeling configurations of objects by relaxing the Blum conditions and they extend in a minimal way the individual “skeletal structures” which have been previously used for modeling individual objects and capturing their geometric properties.	Semantic Scholar
This allows for the mathematical methods introduced for single objects to be significantly extended to the entire configuration of objects.	Semantic Scholar
These methods not only capture the internal shape structures of the individual objects but also the external structure of the neighboring regions of the objects.	Semantic Scholar
In the subsequent second paper (Damon and Gasparovic in Shape and positional geometry of multi-object configurations) we use these structures to identify specific external regions which capture positional information about neighboring objects, and we develop numerical measures for closeness of portions of objects and their significance for the configuration.	Semantic Scholar
This allows us to use the same mathematical structures to simultaneously analyze both the shape properties of the individual objects and positional properties of the configuration.	Semantic Scholar
This provides a framework for analyzing the statistical properties of collections of similar configurations such as for applications to medical imaging.	Semantic Scholar

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive brain imaging technique that describes neural electrical activation with good temporal resolution.	Semantic Scholar
Source localization is required for clinical and functional interpretations of EEG signals, and most commonly is achieved via the dipole model; however, the number of dipoles in the brain should be determined for a reasonably accurate interpretation.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a dipole source localization (DSL) method that adaptively estimates the dipole number by using a novel information criterion.	Semantic Scholar
Since the particle filtering process is nonparametric, it is not clear whether conventional information criteria such as Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) can be applied.	Semantic Scholar
In the proposed method, multiple particle filters run in parallel, each of which respectively estimates the dipole locations and moments, with the assumption that the dipole number is known and fixed; at every time step, the most predictive particle filter is selected by using an information criterion tailored for particle filters.	Semantic Scholar
We tested the proposed information criterion first through experiments on artificial datasets; these experiments supported the hypothesis that the proposed information criterion would outperform both AIC and BIC.	Semantic Scholar
We then analyzed real human EEG datasets collected during an auditory short-term memory task using the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
We found that the alpha-band dipoles were localized to the right and left auditory areas during the auditory short-term memory task, which is consistent with previous physiological findings.	Semantic Scholar
These analyses suggest the proposed information criterion can work well in both model and real-world situations.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents preliminary results of the application of two-Kinect cameras system on a two-wheeled indoor mobile robot for off-line optimal path planning and execution.	Semantic Scholar
In our approach, the robot makes use of depth information delivered by the vision system to accurately model its surrounding environment through image processing techniques.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, a Genetic Algorithm is implemented to generate a collision-free optimal path linking an initial configuration of the mobile robot (Source) to a final configuration (Target).	Semantic Scholar
After that, Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial is used to smooth the generated optimal path.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, an Adaptive Fuzzy-Logic controller is designed to keep track of a mobile robot on the desired smoothed path (by transmitting the appropriate right and left velocities using wireless communication).	Semantic Scholar
In parallel, sensor fusion (odometry sensors and Kinect sensors) is used to estimate the current position and orientation of the robot using Kalman filter.	Semantic Scholar
The validation of the proposed solution is carried out using the differentially-driven mobile robot, RobuTER, to successfully achieve safe motion (without colliding with obstacles) in an indoor environment.	Semantic Scholar
Methods from computational topology are becoming more and more popular in computer vision and have shown to improve the state-of-the-art in several tasks.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we investigate the applicability of topological descriptors in the context of 3D surface analysis for the classification of different surface textures.	Semantic Scholar
We present a comprehensive study on topological descriptors, investigate their robustness and expressiveness and compare them with state-of-the-art methods including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).	Semantic Scholar
Results show that class-specific information is reflected well in topological descriptors.	Semantic Scholar
The investigated descriptors can directly compete with non-topological descriptors and capture complementary information.	Semantic Scholar
As a consequence they improve the state-of-the-art when combined with non-topological descriptors.	Semantic Scholar
To detect changes in an environment, one has to decide whether a set of recent observations is incompatible with a set of previous observations.	Semantic Scholar
For binary, lidar-based grid maps, this is essentially the case when the laser beam traverses a voxel that has been observed as occupied, or when the beam is reflected by a voxel that has been observed as empty.	Semantic Scholar
However, in real-world environments, some voxels are neither completely occupied nor completely free.	Semantic Scholar
These voxels have to be modeled by real-valued variables, whose estimation is an inherently statistical process.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, it is nontrivial to decide whether two sets of observations emerge from the same underlying true map values, and hence from an unchanged environment.	Semantic Scholar
Our main idea is to account for the statistical nature of the estimation by leveraging the full map posteriors instead of only the most likely maps.	Semantic Scholar
Closed-form solutions of posteriors over real-valued grid maps have been introduced recently.	Semantic Scholar
We leverage a similarity measure on these posteriors to score each point in time according to the probability that it constitutes a change in the hidden map value.	Semantic Scholar
While the proposed approach works for any type of real-valued grid map that allows the computation of the full posterior, we provide all formulas for the well-known reflection maps and the recently introduced decay-rate maps.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce and compare different similarity measures and show that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches in simulated and real-world experiments.	Semantic Scholar
This letter proposes a novel technique for the real-time estimation of the human feet ground reaction forces (GRFs) and centers of pressure (CoP) from the whole-body CoP and body configuration.	Semantic Scholar
The estimated variables are used for the estimation of the overloading torques in human joints during double support, with the aim to provide an evaluation of the human ergonomics while performing heavy manipulation tasks with a robot, or when exposed to an external force.	Semantic Scholar
The estimation of the feet GRFs and CoP is achieved using a synergistic approach that combines a simplified geometrical model of the whole-body CoP and a learning technique to address the underdetermined force distribution problem.	Semantic Scholar
First, a statically equivalent serial chain (SESC) model which enables the whole-body CoP estimation is identified.	Semantic Scholar
Then, the estimated whole-body CoP and the simplified body pose information are used for the training and validation of the learning technique.	Semantic Scholar
The displacements between the feet CoP estimated using the synergistic model and the values measured using insole sensors, along with the GRFs vectors are finally used for the estimation of the body overloading joint torques.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed synergistic model is first validated experimentally in five subjects.	Semantic Scholar
Next, its real-time efficacy is assessed in a human–robot load sharing task, in which the robot trajectories are optimized to minimize the effect of the external load on the human joints.	Semantic Scholar
Micro air vehicles often have limited versatility with restrictions on endurance, agility, hover capability, and payload.	Semantic Scholar
A hybrid vehicle is proposed that addresses these constraints using a tailsitter design and novel dual tilting rotors.	Semantic Scholar
Transition between hover and forward flight is achieved by rotating the body with control authority provided by only the tilting rotors in a minimally actuated design.	Semantic Scholar
The addition of tilting rotors allows for improved actuation capacity and control throughout transition.	Semantic Scholar
A cascaded control methodology is presented that accounts for large body rotations using the resolved tilt-twist method.	Semantic Scholar
Nonlinear backstepping converts the control forces and moments to actuator inputs while considering the unique vehicle dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
A prototype vehicle is constructed with the control strategy running in an embedded flight controller and transition is demonstrated experimentally.	Semantic Scholar
The vehicle is able to maintain control authority throughout transition while also achieving increased efficiency in forward flight.	Semantic Scholar
This letter discusses the development of a mosaicking algorithm for building large- and high-resolution confocal images.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the nature of optics and vision systems in general, there is still a dilemma between choosing a wide field-of-view and high resolution.	Semantic Scholar
The most accepted solution is to opt for a high-resolution optics and expand the FOV algorithmically thanks to mosaicking approaches.	Semantic Scholar
The study reported in this letter consists of online and real-time construction of large mosaics using individual confocal images with a micrometer resolution.	Semantic Scholar
These individual images are provided by a confocal laser endomicroscopy system which can grab in vivo real-time images through a minimally invasive access.	Semantic Scholar
The acquisition of the confocal images is achieved by moving the imaging probe on the studied sample surface with a constant contact between the probe and the sample.	Semantic Scholar
The mosaicking algorithm proposed in this letter deals with the combination of both the robot inputs and the image registrations.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method has demonstrated very promising performances in terms of accuracy and robustness with regard to image noise (poor image quality or loss of contact between the probe and the sample) as well as misregistration issues.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments carried out with a highly accurate robotic system and a ground truth obtained by conventional optical microscopy demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach.	Semantic Scholar
unknown	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a method, namely $\epsilon$ CCA, for collision avoidance in dynamic environments among interacting agents, such as other robots or humans.	Semantic Scholar
Given a preferred motion by a global planner or driver, the method computes a collision-free local motion for a short time horizon, which respects the actuator constraints and allows for smooth and safe control.	Semantic Scholar
The method builds on the concept of reciprocal velocity obstacles and extends it to respect the kinodynamic constraints of the robot and account for a grid-based map representation of the environment.	Semantic Scholar
The method is best suited for large multirobot settings, including heterogeneous teams of robots, in which computational complexity is of paramount importance and the robots interact with one another.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we consider a set of motion primitives for the robot and solve an optimization in the space of control velocities with additional constraints.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, we propose a cooperative approach to compute safe velocity partitions in the distributed case.	Semantic Scholar
We describe several instances of the method for distributed and centralized operation and formulated both as convex and nonconvex optimizations.	Semantic Scholar
We compare the different variants and describe the benefits and tradeoffs both theoretically and in extensive experiments with various robotic platforms: robotic wheelchairs, robotic boats, humanoid robots, small unicycle robots, and simulated cars.	Semantic Scholar
We proposed a kind of naturally combined shape-color affine moment invariants (SCAMI), which consider both shape and color affine transformations simultaneously in one single system.	Semantic Scholar
In the real scene, color and shape deformations always exist in images simultaneously.	Semantic Scholar
Simple shape invariants or color invariants can not be qualified for this situation.	Semantic Scholar
The conventional method is just to make a simple linear combination of the two factors.	Semantic Scholar
Meanwhile, the manual selection of weights is a complex issue.	Semantic Scholar
Our construction method is based on the multiple integration framework.	Semantic Scholar
The integral kernel is assigned as the continued product of the shape and color invariant cores.	Semantic Scholar
It is the first time to directly derive an invariant to dual affine transformations of shape and color.	Semantic Scholar
The manual selection of weights is no longer necessary, and both the shape and color transformations are extended to affine transformation group.	Semantic Scholar
With the various of invariant cores, a set of lower-order invariants are constructed and the completeness and independence are discussed detailedly.	Semantic Scholar
A set of SCAMIs, which called SCAMI24, are recommended, and the effectiveness and robustness have been evaluated on both synthetic and real datasets.	Semantic Scholar

Real social networks contain many communities, where members within each community are densely connected with each other, while they are sparsely connected with the members outside of the community.	Semantic Scholar
Since each member can join multiple communities simultaneously, communities in social networks are usually overlapping with each other.	Semantic Scholar
How to efficiently and effectively identify overlapping communities in a large social network becomes a fundamental problem in the big data era.	Semantic Scholar
Most existing studies on community finding focused on non-overlapping communities based on several well-known community fitness metrics.	Semantic Scholar
However, recent investigations have shown that these fitness metrics may suffer free rider and separation effects where the overlapping region of two communities always belongs to the denser one, rather to both of them.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study the overlapping community detection problem in social networks that not only takes the quality of the found overlapping communities but also incorporate both free rider and separation effects on the found communities into consideration.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, in this paper, we first propose a novel community fitness metric - triangle based fitness metric, for overlapping community detection that can minimize the free rider and separation effects on found overlapping communities, and show that the problem is NP-hard.	Semantic Scholar
We then propose an efficient yet scalable algorithm for the problem that can deliver a feasible solution.	Semantic Scholar
We finally validate the effectiveness of the proposed fitness metric and evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, through conducting extensive experiments on real-world datasets with over 100 million vertices and edges.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is very promising.	Semantic Scholar
In industry, many problems are considered as the decentralized resource-constrained multi-project scheduling problem (DRCMPSP).	Semantic Scholar
Existing approaches encounter difficulties in dealing with large DRCMPSP cases while respecting the information privacy requirements of the project agents.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we tackle DRCMPSP by formulating it as a multi-unit combinatorial auction (Wellman et al.	Semantic Scholar
in Games Econ Behav 35(1):271–303, 2001), which does not require sensitive private project information.	Semantic Scholar
To handle the hardness of bidder valuation, we introduce the capacity query which uses different item capacity profiles to efficiently elicit valuation information from bidders.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the capacity query, we adopt two existing strategies (Gonen and Lehmann in Proceedings of the 2nd ACM conference on electronic commerce, pp 13–20, 2000) for solving multi-unit winner determination problems to find good allocations of the DRCMPSP auctions.	Semantic Scholar
The first strategy employs a greedy allocation process, which can rapidly find good allocations by allocating the bidder with the best answer after each query.	Semantic Scholar
The second strategy is based on a branch-and-bound process to improve the results of the first strategy, by searching for a better sequence of granting the bids from the bidders.	Semantic Scholar
Empirical results indicate that the two strategies can find good solutions with higher quality than state-of-the-art decentralized approaches, and scale well to large-scale problems with thousands of activities from tens of projects.	Semantic Scholar
McKibben actuators, comprised of an elastomeric tube wrapped in inextensible fibers, were developed in the 1950s and have been used primarily in pneumatic applications.	Semantic Scholar
Mc-Kibben actuators provide superior force and power density at a lower cost compared to many conventional actuators due to their simple design.	Semantic Scholar
This paper explores driving McKibben actuators with high-pressure hydraulics and reflects on some challenges associated with modeling the actuators at hydraulic pressures.	Semantic Scholar
Twelve actuators were designed, fabricated, and tested experimentally over a range of contraction ratios.	Semantic Scholar
Four modeling approaches were evaluated against experimental data including a new model that eliminates some of the limitations of existing models by predicting output force as a function of initial actuator geometry only and capturing the nonlinear variation in elastomer wall thickness as the actuator is strained.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results suggest that the existing McKibben force models presented in this paper are not as accurate as the new model for tracking total axial force generation.	Semantic Scholar
The absolute value of the error from experimental values of each of the four models ranged from 9.1% for the new model developed in this paper to 9.9%, 10.0%, and 10.5% for the three other existing approaches, but the new model has unique advantages in modeling hydraulic McKibben actuators that require thicker tube walls.	Semantic Scholar
This study lays the ground work for future research in modeling soft robots comprised of compliant actuators powered hydraulically at high pressures.	Semantic Scholar

The body structures of tendon-driven musculoskeletal humanoids are complex, and accurate modeling is difficult, because they are made by imitating the body structures of human beings.	Semantic Scholar
For this reason, we have not been able to move them accurately like ordinary humanoids driven by actuators in each axis, and large internal muscle tension and slack of tendon wires have emerged by the model error between its geometric model and the actual robot.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we construct a joint-muscle mapping (JMM) using a neural network (NN), which expresses a nonlinear relationship between joint angles and muscle lengths, and aim to move tendon-driven musculoskeletal humanoids accurately by updating the JMM online from data of the actual robot.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, the JMM is updated online by using the vision of the robot so that it moves to the correct position (Vision Updater).	Semantic Scholar
Also, we execute another update to modify muscle antagonisms correctly (Antagonism Updater).	Semantic Scholar
By using these two updaters, the error between the target and actual joint angles decrease to about 40% in 5 min, and we show through a manipulation experiment that the tendon-driven musculoskeletal humanoid Kengoro becomes able to move as intended.	Semantic Scholar
This novel system can adapt to the state change and growth of robots, because it updates the JMM online successively.	Semantic Scholar

This letter presents an automated method for creating spatial maps of soil condition with an outdoor mobile robot.	Semantic Scholar
Effective soil mapping on farms can enhance yields, reduce inputs, and help protect the environment.	Semantic Scholar
Traditionally, data are collected manually at an arbitrary set of locations, then soil maps are constructed offline using kriging, a form of Gaussian process regression.	Semantic Scholar
This process is laborious and costly, limiting the quality and resolution of the resulting information.	Semantic Scholar
Instead, we propose to use an outdoor mobile robot for automatic collection of soil condition data, building soil maps online and also adapting the robot's exploration strategy on-the-fly based on the current quality of the map.	Semantic Scholar
We show how using kriging variance as a reward function for robotic exploration allows for both more efficient data collection and better soil models.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents the theoretical foundations for our proposal and an experimental comparison of exploration strategies using soil compaction data from a field generated with a mobile robot.	Semantic Scholar
In the literature on robotics and multibody dynamics, the concept of average angular velocity has received considerable attention in recent years.	Semantic Scholar
We address the question of whether the average angular velocity defines an orientation frame that depends only on the current robot configuration and provide a simple algebraic condition to check whether this holds.	Semantic Scholar
In the language of geometric mechanics, this condition corresponds to requiring the flatness of the mechanical connection associated with the robotic system.	Semantic Scholar
Here, however, we provide both a reinterpretation and a proof of this result accessible to readers with a background in rigid body kinematics and multibody dynamics but not necessarily acquainted with differential geometry, still providing precise links to the geometric mechanics literature.	Semantic Scholar
This should help spreading the algebraic condition beyond the scope of geometric mechanics, contributing to a proper utilization and understanding of the concept of average angular velocity.	Semantic Scholar
We consider the problem of privacy enforcement for dynamic systems using the technique of obfuscation.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach captures the trade-off between privacy and utility, in a formal reactive framework.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we model a dynamic system as an automaton or labeled transition system with predefined secret behaviors.	Semantic Scholar
The system generates event strings for some useful computation (utility).	Semantic Scholar
At the same time, it must hide its secret behaviors from any outside observer of its behavior (privacy).	Semantic Scholar
We formally capture both privacy and utility specifications within the model of the system.	Semantic Scholar
We propose as obfuscation mechanism for privacy enforcement the use of edit functions that suitably alter the output behavior of the system by inserting, deleting, or replacing events in its output strings.	Semantic Scholar
The edit function must hide secret behaviors by making them observationally equivalent to non-secret behaviors, while at the same time satisfying the utility requirement on the output strings.	Semantic Scholar
We develop algorithmic procedures that synthesize a correct-by-construction edit function satisfying both privacy and utility specifications.	Semantic Scholar
The synthesis procedure is based on the solution of a game where the edit function must react to the system moves by suitable output editing.	Semantic Scholar
After presenting an explicit algorithm for solving for the winning strategies of the game, we present two complementary symbolic implementations to address scalability of our methodology.	Semantic Scholar
The first symbolic implementation uses a direct encoding of the explicit algorithm using binary decision diagrams (BDDs).	Semantic Scholar
The second symbolic implementation reframes the synthesis of edit functions as a supervisory control problem and then applies a recently-developed tool for solving supervisory control problems using BDDs.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results comparing the two symbolic implementations are provided.	Semantic Scholar
A standard procedure for evaluating the performance of classification algorithms is k-fold cross validation.	Semantic Scholar
Since the training sets for any pair of iterations in k-fold cross validation are overlapping when the number of folds is larger than two, the resulting accuracy estimates are considered to be dependent.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, the overlapping of training sets is shown to be irrelevant in determining whether two fold accuracies are dependent or not.	Semantic Scholar
Then a statistical method is proposed to test the appropriateness of assuming independence for the accuracy estimates in k-fold cross validation.	Semantic Scholar
This method is applied on 20 data sets, and the experimental results suggest that it is generally appropriate to assume that the fold accuracies are independent.	Semantic Scholar
The cross validation of non-overlapping training sets can make fold accuracies to be dependent.	Semantic Scholar
However, this dependence almost has no impact on estimating the sample variance of fold accuracies, and hence they can generally be assumed to be independent.	Semantic Scholar
The research question addressed by this study was: What information should be presented to or hidden from decision makers in order to facilitate high performance in decision tasks?	Semantic Scholar
Previous research on information search is limited because of its focus on analytic information acquisition methods; analytic because of the focus on maximizing expected utility; acquisition because of the focus on what information should be added or searched for.	Semantic Scholar
Implementing these methods requires reliable assessments of probabilities, cue weights, and cue values and does not provide suggestions on how to restrict or remove information.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we present four heuristics, or simple rules, for acquiring and restricting information that only require an understanding of the distribution of known and unknown information (information imbalance and complete attribute pairs).	Semantic Scholar
The rules were tested on a range of analytic and heuristic decision strategies within two-option decision tasks across 15 real-world environments.	Semantic Scholar
Though the rules are transparent and easy to communicate (create a balance of information between options and within cues) and require little information to perform, the simulation results show that the rules were generally effective across all environments.	Semantic Scholar
For almost every combination of rule and strategy, the heuristic restriction rules were shown to be more likely to increase rather than decrease accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
In every combination, the heuristic acquisition rules were shown to increase accuracy more than acquiring information that did not adhere to the rules.	Semantic Scholar
Further statistical and mathematical analysis showed that rules are mediated by strategies’ full information accuracy and estimates of missing information.	Semantic Scholar
We present a new vectorial total variation method that addresses the problem of color consistent image filtering.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach is inspired from the double-opponent cell representation in the human visual cortex.	Semantic Scholar
Existing methods of vectorial total variation regularizers have insufficient (or no) coupling between the color channels and thus may introduce color artifacts.	Semantic Scholar
We address this problem by introducing a novel coupling between the color channels related to a pullbackmetric from the opponent space to the data (RGB color) space.	Semantic Scholar
Our energy is a non-convex, non-smooth higher-order vectorial total variation approach and promotes color consistent image filtering via a coupling term.	Semantic Scholar
For a convex variant, we show well-posedness and existence of a solution in the space of vectorial bounded variation.	Semantic Scholar
For the higher-order scheme we employ a half-quadratic strategy, which model the non-convex energy terms as the infimum of a sequence of quadratic functions.	Semantic Scholar
In experiments, we elaborate on traditional image restoration applications of inpainting, deblurring and denoising.	Semantic Scholar
Regarding the latter, we demonstrate state of the art restoration quality with respect to structure coherence and color consistency.	Semantic Scholar
In estimating the frequency spectrum of real-world time series data, we must violate the assumption of infinite-length, orthogonal components in the Fourier basis.	Semantic Scholar
While it is widely known that care must be taken with discretely sampled data to avoid aliasing of high frequencies, less attention is given to the influence of low frequencies with period below the sampling time window.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we derive an analytic expression for the side-lobe attenuation of signal components in the frequency domain representation.	Semantic Scholar
This expression allows us to detail the influence of individual frequency components throughout the spectrum.	Semantic Scholar
The first consequence is that the presence of low-frequency components introduces a 1/f component across the power spectrum, with a scaling exponent of .	Semantic Scholar
This scaling artifact could be composed of diffuse low-frequency components, which can render it difficult to detect a priori.	Semantic Scholar
Further, treatment of the signal with standard digital signal processing techniques cannot easily remove this scaling component.	Semantic Scholar
While several theoretical models have been introduced to explain the ubiquitous 1/f scaling component in neuroscientific data, we conjecture here that some experimental observations could be the result of such data analysis procedures.	Semantic Scholar
This letter describes the improvement of two methods of detecting high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) and their use to localize epileptic seizure onset zones (SOZs).	Semantic Scholar
The wavelet transform (WT) method was improved by combining the complex Morlet WT with Shannon entropy to enhance the temporal-frequency resolution during HFO detection.	Semantic Scholar
And the matching pursuit (MP) method was improved by combining it with an adaptive genetic algorithm to improve the speed and accuracy of the calculations for HFO detection.	Semantic Scholar
The HFOs detected by these two methods were used to localize SOZs in five patients.	Semantic Scholar
A comparison shows that the improved WT method provides high specificity and quick localization and that the improved MP method provides high sensitivity.	Semantic Scholar
Many small insects such as water striders can leap from water surface.	Semantic Scholar
Inspired by their jumping capability, we present the design of a novel, miniature, water surface jumping robot in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
Jumping from water surface is more challenging than jumping from ground due to the liquid water surface.	Semantic Scholar
We address this problem by using carbon fiber strip to store energy, two wings to flap the water surface, a hollow body to initially support the robot, and an intermittent gear train to charge and release energy.	Semantic Scholar
With such a design, the final robot weighs around 12.5 g and has a maximum size of 10 cm.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that the robot can jump up to 9.5 cm in height, which is close to the predicted results from a dynamic model developed by us to capture the hydrodynamic behaviors of the robot during the whole jumping process.	Semantic Scholar
The research presented in this paper offers a new design of tiny robots for mimicking the water-jumping capability of aquatic insects.	Semantic Scholar
The robot, if equipped with sensors, can be employed for aquatic environmental monitoring of water quality.	Semantic Scholar
Force-based manipulation control strategies are evolving as a primary mechanism in robotics for performing the fine manipulation tasks typical within manufacturing assembly.	Semantic Scholar
The ability to systematically compare robotic system performance and quantify true advancement in fine manipulation is of utmost importance.	Semantic Scholar
Accordingly, the objectives of this paper are threefold: 1) creation of a peg-in-hole test method with associated performance metrics and a systematic data analysis strategy for performance benchmarking, 2) first demonstration of a recently developed manipulation controller piloting a robotic hand and its paired task-level logic for completing the peg-in-hole test, and 3) exemplifying the performance benchmarking technique by comparing two approaches for robotic insertions—the previously mentioned compliant hand, stiff arm system, and a stiff gripper, compliant arm system.	Semantic Scholar
Analyses reveal that the unconventional hand system can perform at and sometimes above the level of the gripper system in the developed peg-in-hole scenario.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the hand's active control of the peg's full Cartesian pose reduces positional error sensitivity and minimizes exerted insertion forces, highlighting the strategy's potential for fine manipulation tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Results indicate that robotic arms equipped with highly articulated and sensorized robotic hands can provide a truly realizable solution path for performing peg-in-hole tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) concerns the problem of how to improve classifiers’ performance through making use of prior knowledge from unlabeled data.	Semantic Scholar
Many SSL methods have been developed to integrate unlabeled data into the classifiers based on either the manifold or cluster assumption in recent years.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the graph-based approaches, following the manifold assumption, have achieved a promising performance in many real-world applications.	Semantic Scholar
However, most of them work well on small-scale data sets only and lack probabilistic outputs.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a scalable graph-based SSL framework through sparse Bayesian model is proposed by defining a graph-based sparse prior.	Semantic Scholar

Extensive experiments on various data sets verify that our algorithms can achieve comparable classification effectiveness and efficiency with much better scalability.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the generalization error bound is derived based on robustness analysis.	Semantic Scholar
Coordinate regression has established itself as one of the most successful current trends in model-based 6 degree of freedom (6-DOF) object pose estimation from a single image.	Semantic Scholar
The underlying idea is to train a system that can regress the three-dimensional coordinates of an object, given an input RGB or RGB-D image and known object geometry, followed by a robust procedure such as RANSAC to optimize the object pose.	Semantic Scholar
These coordinate regression based approaches exhibit state-of-the-art performance by using pixel-level cues to model the probability distribution of object parts within the image.	Semantic Scholar
However, they fail to capture global information at the object level to learn accurate foreground/background segmentation.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we show that combining global features for object segmentation and local features for coordinate regression results in pixel-accurate object boundary detections and consequently a substantial reduction in outliers and an increase in overall performance.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a deep architecture with an instance-level object segmentation network that exploits global image information for object/background segmentation and a pixel-level classification network for coordinate regression based on local features.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our approach on the standard ground-truth 6-DOF pose estimation benchmarks and show that our joint approach to accurate object segmentation and coordinate regression results in the state-of-the-art performance on both RGB and RGB-D 6-DOF pose estimation.	Semantic Scholar
Underwater robots beneath ocean waves can benefit from feedforward control to reduce position error.	Semantic Scholar
This letter proposes a method using model predictive control (MPC) to predict and counteract future disturbances from an ocean wave field.	Semantic Scholar
The MPC state estimator employs a linear wave theory (LWT) solver to approximate the component fluid dynamics under a wave field.	Semantic Scholar
Wave data from deployed ocean buoys are used to construct the simulated wave field.	Semantic Scholar
The MPC state estimator is used to optimize a set of control actions by gradient descent along a prediction horizon.	Semantic Scholar
The optimized control input minimizes a global cost function, the squared distance from the target state.	Semantic Scholar
The robot then carries out the optimized trajectory with an emphasis on real-time execution.	Semantic Scholar
Several prediction horizons are compared, with a horizon of 0.8 s selected as having a good balance of low error and fast computation.	Semantic Scholar
The controller with the chosen prediction horizon is simulated and found to show a 74% reduction in position error over traditional feedback control.	Semantic Scholar
Additional simulations are run where the MPC takes in noisy measurements of the wave field parameters.	Semantic Scholar
The MPC algorithm is shown to be resistant to sensor noise, showing a mean position error 44% lower than the noise-free feedback control case.	Semantic Scholar
Augmented reality (AR) enriches our physical world with digital content and media, such as three-dimensional models and videos, overlaying in real time the camera view of our smartphone, tablet, laptop, or glasses.	Semantic Scholar
Despite the recent massive interest for this technology, it is still not possible to receive rich haptic feedback when interacting with augmented environments.	Semantic Scholar
This lack is mainly due to the poor diffusion of suitable haptic interfaces, which should be easy to wear, lightweight, compact, and inexpensive.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we briefly review the state of the art on wearable haptics and its application in AR.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we present three AR use cases, considering tasks of manipulation, guidance, and gaming, using both external cameras with standard screens as well as fully wearable solutions, using the Microsoft HoloLens.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate these tasks enrolling a total of 34 subjects, analyzing performance and user experience when using a 3-DoF wearable device for the fingertip, a 2-DoF wearable device for the proximal finger phalanx, a vibrotactile ring, and a popular sensory substitution technique (interaction force displayed as a colored bar).	Semantic Scholar
Results show that providing haptic feedback through the wearable devices significantly improves the performance, intuitiveness, and comfort of the considered AR tasks.	Semantic Scholar
The reduction of muscular strength in elderly people and patients with neurological movement disorders drastically reduces the hand autonomy for performing several daily activities.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents preliminary results towards a novel supernumerary hand system, i.e., the SoftHand X, that aims to augment the grasping capabilities of people with reduced hand functionalities.	Semantic Scholar
The system consists of an active soft robotic hand and a passive gravity compensation mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
A primary issue in the design of this supernumerary limb is its placement with respect to the user's arm, due to its profound effects in terms of expected kinematics and dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
This letter addresses this problem with a detailed analysis based on theoretical performance indexes and experimental proofs.	Semantic Scholar
Starting from 16 different positions, 2 optimal positions are found with multivariate optimization and then they are experimentally evaluated by 11 healthy subjects performing standard clinical tests.	Semantic Scholar
Both analytical and experimental results identify these two positions as the closest to those of the human hand, assumed as the optimum.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, a questionnaire and subjects’ suggestion reveal one of them strongly favorite.	Semantic Scholar
Controlled natural language (CNL) has great potential to support human–machine interaction (HMI) because it provides an information representation that is both human readable and machine processable.	Semantic Scholar
We investigated the effectiveness of a CNL-based conversational interface for HMI in a behavioral experiment called simple human experiment regarding locally observed collective knowledge (Sherlock).	Semantic Scholar
In Sherlock, individuals acted in groups to discover and report information to the machine using natural language (NL), which the machine then processed into CNL.	Semantic Scholar
The machine fused responses from different users to form a common operating picture, a dashboard showing the level of agreement for distinct information.	Semantic Scholar
To obtain information to add to this dashboard, users explored the real world in a simulated crowdsourced sensing scenario.	Semantic Scholar
This scenario represented a simplified controlled analog for tactical intelligence (i.e., direct intelligence of the environment), which is key for rapidly planning military, law enforcement, and emergency operations.	Semantic Scholar
Overall, despite close to zero training, 74% of the users inputted NL that was machine interpretable and addressed the assigned tasks.	Semantic Scholar
An experimental manipulation aimed to increase user–machine interaction, however, did not improve performance as hypothesized.	Semantic Scholar
Nevertheless, results indicate that the conversational interface may be effective in assisting humans with collection and fusion of information in a crowdsourcing context.	Semantic Scholar
The success of autonomous systems will depend upon their ability to safely navigate human-centric environments.	Semantic Scholar
This motivates the need for a real-time, probabilistic forecasting algorithm for pedestrians, cyclists, and other agents since these predictions will form a necessary step in assessing the risk of any action.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a novel approach to probabilistic forecasting for pedestrians based on weighted sums of ordinary differential equations that are learned from historical trajectory information within a fixed scene.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting algorithm is embarrassingly parallel and is able to work at real-time speeds using a naive Python implementation.	Semantic Scholar
The quality of predicted locations of agents generated by the proposed algorithm is validated on a variety of examples and is considerably higher than existing state of the art approaches over long time horizons.	Semantic Scholar
There has been growing interest on agents that represent people’s interests or act on their behalf such as automated negotiators, self-driving cars, or drones.	Semantic Scholar
Even though people will interact often with others via these agent representatives, little is known about whether people’s behavior changes when acting through these agents, when compared to direct interaction with others.	Semantic Scholar
Here we show that people’s decisions will change in important ways because of these agents; specifically, we showed that interacting via agents is likely to lead people to behave more fairly, when compared to direct interaction with others.	Semantic Scholar
We argue this occurs because programming an agent leads people to adopt a broader perspective, consider the other side’s position, and rely on social norms—such as fairness—to guide their decision making.	Semantic Scholar
To support this argument, we present four experiments: in Experiment 1 we show that people made fairer offers in the ultimatum and impunity games when interacting via agent representatives, when compared to direct interaction; in Experiment 2, participants were less likely to accept unfair offers in these games when agent representatives were involved; in Experiment 3, we show that the act of thinking about the decisions ahead of time—i.e., under the so-called “strategy method”—can also lead to increased fairness, even when no agents are involved; and, finally, in Experiment 4 we show that participants were less likely to reach an agreement with unfair counterparts in a negotiation setting.	Semantic Scholar
We discuss theoretical implications for our understanding of the nature of people’s social behavior with agent representatives, as well as practical implications for the design of agents that have the potential to increase fairness in society.	Semantic Scholar

A novel statistical feature extraction method, called the neighborhood preserving neural network (NPNN), is proposed in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
NPNN can be viewed as a nonlinear data-driven fault detection technique through preserving the local geometrical structure of normal process data.	Semantic Scholar
"The ""local geometrical structure "" means that each sample can be constructed as a linear combination of its neighbors."	Semantic Scholar
NPNN is characterized by adaptively training a nonlinear neural network which takes the local geometrical structure of the data into consideration.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, in order to extract uncorrelated and faithful features, NPNN adopts orthogonal constraints in the objective function.	Semantic Scholar
Through backpropagation and eigen decomposition (ED) technique, NPNN is optimized to extract low-dimensional features from original high-dimensional process data.	Semantic Scholar
After nonlinear feature extraction, Hotelling T2 statistic and the squared prediction error (SPE) statistic are utilized for the fault detection tasks.	Semantic Scholar
The advantages of the proposed NPNN method are demonstrated by both theoretical analysis and case studies on the Tennessee Eastman (TE) benchmark process.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experimental results show the superiority of NPNN in terms of missed detection rate (MDR) and false alarm rate (FAR).	Semantic Scholar
The source code of NPNN can be found in https://github.com/htzhaoecust/npnn.	Semantic Scholar
Over the last 5 years, methods based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have shown impressive performance improvements for object detection and recognition problems.	Semantic Scholar
This has been made possible due to the availability of large annotated datasets, a better understanding of the non-linear mapping between input images and class labels as well as the affordability of GPUs.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present the design details of a deep learning system for unconstrained face recognition, including modules for face detection, association, alignment and face verification.	Semantic Scholar
The quantitative performance evaluation is conducted using the IARPA Janus Benchmark A (IJB-A), the JANUS Challenge Set 2 (JANUS CS2), and the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset.	Semantic Scholar
The IJB-A dataset includes real-world unconstrained faces of 500 subjects with significant pose and illumination variations which are much harder than the LFW and Youtube Face datasets.	Semantic Scholar
JANUS CS2 is the extended version of IJB-A which contains not only all the images/frames of IJB-A but also includes the original videos.	Semantic Scholar
Some open issues regarding DCNNs for face verification problems are then discussed.	Semantic Scholar
This paper addresses the problem of H∞ state estimation for a class of stochastic memristor-based neural networks with time-varying delays.	Semantic Scholar
Under the framework of Filippov solution, the stochastic memristor-based neural networks are transformed into systems with interval parameters.	Semantic Scholar
The present paper is the first to investigate the H∞ state estimation problem for continuous-time Itô-type stochastic memristor-based neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
By means of Lyapunov functionals and some stochastic technique, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure that the estimation error system is asymptotically stable in the mean square with a prescribed H∞ performance.	Semantic Scholar
An explicit expression of the state estimator gain is given in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).	Semantic Scholar
Compared with other results, our results reduce control gain and control cost effectively.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the theoretical results.	Semantic Scholar
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) updates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a noisy gradient computed from a random batch, and each batch evenly updates the network once in an epoch.	Semantic Scholar
This model applies the same training effort to each batch, but it overlooks the fact that the gradient variance, induced by Sampling Bias and Intrinsic Image Difference, renders different training dynamics on batches.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we develop a new training strategy for SGD, referred to as Inconsistent Stochastic Gradient Descent (ISGD) to address this problem.	Semantic Scholar
The core concept of ISGD is the inconsistent training, which dynamically adjusts the training effort w.r.t the loss.	Semantic Scholar
ISGD models the training as a stochastic process that gradually reduces down the mean of batch's loss, and it utilizes a dynamic upper control limit to identify a large loss batch on the fly.	Semantic Scholar
ISGD stays on the identified batch to accelerate the training with additional gradient updates, and it also has a constraint to penalize drastic parameter changes.	Semantic Scholar
ISGD is straightforward, computationally efficient and without requiring auxiliary memories.	Semantic Scholar
A series of empirical evaluations on real world datasets and networks demonstrate the promising performance of inconsistent training.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents the experimental evaluation of a bilateral feedback law for the teleoperation of an underactuated dynamic system: the Cart-Pole.	Semantic Scholar
This physical system illustrates another simple model, the Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP); a popular template for legged robot control and, in this letter, the mapping channel between the operator and robot.	Semantic Scholar
We develop a scaling strategy based on geometric and kinematic similarity in order to generate dynamically feasible trajectories for the LIP with a natural frequency different than the human's.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, by modifying the classic equations for the Cart-Pole, we show how it can competently represent the proposed template quantitatively and visually.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments where a human operator dynamically controls slave systems with slower or faster natural frequencies illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
This study is a step toward building a human–machine interface that dynamically synchronize operator and legged robot in order to eventually achieve complex motor behaviors.	Semantic Scholar
Teleoperated robotic surgery allows filtering and scaling the hand motion to achieve high precision during the surgical interventions.	Semantic Scholar
Teleoperation represents a very complex sensory-motor task, mainly due to the kinematic and kinetic redundancies that characterize the human motor control.	Semantic Scholar
It requires an intensive training phase to acquire sufficient familiarity with the master–slave architecture.	Semantic Scholar
We estimated the hand stiffness modulation during the execution of a simulated suturing task in teleoperation, with two different master devices, and in free hand.	Semantic Scholar
Kinematic data of eight right-handed users were acquired, using electromagnetic and optical tracking systems, and analyzed using a musculoskeletal model.	Semantic Scholar
Through inverse dynamics, muscular activation was computed and used to obtain the joint torque and stiffness, leading to end-point stiffness estimation.	Semantic Scholar
The maximal stiffness value and its angular displacement with respect to the trajectory tangent were computed.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that there is a difference in how the main stiffness axis was modulated by using the two master devices with respect to free hand, with higher values and variability for the serial link manipulator.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, a directional modulation of the hand stiffness through the trajectory was found, showing that the users were aligning the direction of the main stiffness axis perpendicularly to the trajectory.	Semantic Scholar
The dentate gyrus forms a critical link between the entorhinal cortex and CA3 by providing a sparse version of the signal.	Semantic Scholar
Concurrent with this increase in sparsity, a widely accepted theory suggests the dentate gyrus performs pattern separation—similar inputs yield decorrelated outputs.	Semantic Scholar
Although an active region of study and theory, few logically rigorous arguments detail the dentate gyrus’s (DG) coding.	Semantic Scholar
We suggest a theoretically tractable, combinatorial model for this action.	Semantic Scholar
The model provides formal methods for a highly redundant, arbitrarily sparse, and decorrelated output signal.To explore the value of this model framework, we assess how suitable it is for two notable aspects of DG coding: how it can handle the highly structured grid cell representation in the input entorhinal cortex region and the presence of adult neurogenesis, which has been proposed to produce a heterogeneous code in the DG.	Semantic Scholar
We find tailoring the model to grid cell input yields expansion parameters consistent with the literature.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the heterogeneous coding reflects activity gradation observed experimentally.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we connect this approach with more conventional binary threshold neural circuit models via a formal embedding.	Semantic Scholar
Automatically recognizing and localizing wide ranges of human actions are crucial for video understanding.	Semantic Scholar
Towards this goal, the THUMOS challenge was introduced in 2013 to serve as a benchmark for action recognition.	Semantic Scholar
Until then, video action recognition, including THUMOS challenge, had focused primarily on the classification of pre-segmented (i.e., trimmed) videos, which is an artificial task.	Semantic Scholar
In THUMOS 2014, we elevated action recognition to a more practical level by introducing temporally untrimmed videos.	Semantic Scholar
These also include ‘background videos’ which share similar scenes and backgrounds as action videos, but are devoid of the specific actions.	Semantic Scholar
The three editions of the challenge organized in 2013–2015 have made THUMOS a common benchmark for action classification and detection and the annual challenge is widely attended by teams from around the world.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we describe the THUMOS benchmark in detail and give an overview of data collection and annotation procedures.	Semantic Scholar
We present the evaluation protocols used to quantify results in the two THUMOS tasks of action classification and temporal action detection.	Semantic Scholar
We also present results of submissions to the THUMOS 2015 challenge and review the participating approaches.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, we include a comprehensive empirical study evaluating the differences in action recognition between trimmed and untrimmed videos, and how well methods trained on trimmed videos generalize to untrimmed videos.	Semantic Scholar
We conclude by proposing several directions and improvements for future THUMOS challenges.	Semantic Scholar

When proof assistants and theorem provers implement the metatheory of logical systems, they must deal with a range of syntactic expressions (e.g., types, formulas, and proofs) that involve variable bindings.	Semantic Scholar
Since most mature proof assistants do not have built-in methods to treat bindings, they have been extended with various packages and libraries that allow them to encode such syntax using, for example, de Bruijn numerals.	Semantic Scholar
We put forward the argument that bindings are such an intimate aspect of the structure of expressions that they should be accounted for directly in the underlying programming language support for proof assistants and not via packages and libraries.	Semantic Scholar
We present an approach to designing programming languages and proof assistants that directly supports bindings in syntax.	Semantic Scholar
The roots of this approach can be found in the mobility of binders between term-level bindings, formula-level bindings (quantifiers), and proof-level bindings (eigenvariables).	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the combination of Church’s approach to terms and formulas (found in his Simple Theory of Types) and Gentzen’s approach to proofs (found in his sequent calculus) yields a framework for the interaction of bindings with a full range of logical connectives and quantifiers.

We will also illustrate how that framework provides a direct and semantically clean treatment of computation and reasoning with syntax containing bindings.	Semantic Scholar
Some implemented systems, which support this intimate and built-in treatment of bindings, will be briefly described.	Semantic Scholar

This tutorial is concerned with the robot manipulator kinematic functionality that has been available since MATLAB release 2016b.	Semantic Scholar
Neurons communicate nonlinearly through spike activities.	Semantic Scholar
Generalized linear models (GLMs) describe spike activities with a cascade of a linear combination across inputs, a static nonlinear function, and an inhomogeneous Bernoulli or Poisson process, or Cox process if a self-history term is considered.	Semantic Scholar
This structure considers the output nonlinearity in spike generation but excludes the nonlinear interaction among input neurons.	Semantic Scholar
Recent studies extend GLMs by modeling the interaction among input neurons with a quadratic function, which considers the interaction between every pair of input spikes.	Semantic Scholar
However, quadratic effects may not fully capture the nonlinear nature of input interaction.	Semantic Scholar
We therefore propose a staged point-process model to describe the nonlinear interaction among inputs using a few hidden units, which follows the idea of artificial neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
The output firing probability conditioned on inputs is formed as a cascade of two linear-nonlinear (a linear combination plus a static nonlinear function) stages and an inhomogeneous Bernoulli process.	Semantic Scholar
Parameters of this model are estimated by maximizing the log likelihood on output spike trains.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike the iterative reweighted least squares algorithm used in GLMs, where the performance is guaranteed by the concave condition, we propose a modified Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) algorithm, which directly calculates the Hessian matrix of the log likelihood, for the nonlinear optimization in our model.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed model is tested on both synthetic data and real spike train data recorded from the dorsal premotor cortex and primary motor cortex of a monkey performing a center-out task.	Semantic Scholar
Performances are evaluated by discrete-time rescaled Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, where our model statistically outperforms a GLM and its quadratic extension, with a higher goodness-of-fit in the prediction results.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the staged point-process model describes nonlinear interaction among input neurons with fewer parameters than quadratic models, and the modified L-M algorithm also demonstrates fast convergence.	Semantic Scholar
This paper investigates the stability and lag synchronization for memristor-based fuzzy Cohen-Grossberg bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks with mixed delays (asynchronous time delays and continuously distributed delays) and impulses.	Semantic Scholar
By applying the inequality analysis technique, homeomorphism theory and some suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, some new sufficient conditions for the uniqueness and global exponential stability of equilibrium point are established.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we obtain several sufficient criteria concerning globally exponential lag synchronization for the proposed system based on the framework of Filippov solution, differential inclusion theory and control theory.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, some examples with numerical simulations are given to illustrate the feasibility and validity of obtained results.	Semantic Scholar
Trajectory tracking of micro UAVs requires accurate thrust and velocity estimates.	Semantic Scholar
High-quality motion control of quadrotors typically employs accurate high-speed optical sensing indoors.	Semantic Scholar
However, these measurements are not available outdoors, and GPS is unreliable and inadequate for performance motion control.	Semantic Scholar
We have developed small embedded force sensors that mount between a micro UAV's airframe and motors—forces generated by the rotors are measured as they are transmitted to the rigid body of the aircraft.	Semantic Scholar
The direct force measurements can be directly integrated with a model of the mapping between aircraft motion and induced rotor forces.	Semantic Scholar
From this, the translational velocities of the rotors relative to the local wind can be measured, and thus the overall velocity of the aircraft can be inferred.	Semantic Scholar
We have assembled a proof-of-concept quadrotor platform with all four rotors fitted with force sensors, and demonstrate accurate measurement of a quadrotor's lateral velocity during prescribed motions using the onboard force sensors.	Semantic Scholar
The vertical velocity measurement was found to be insensitive.	Semantic Scholar
Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) is an efficient method for solving the problem of approximate similarity search in high-dimensional spaces.	Semantic Scholar
Through LSH, a high-dimensional similarity join can be processed in the same way as hash join, making the cost of joining two large datasets linear.	Semantic Scholar
By judicially analyzing the properties of multiple LSH algorithms, we propose a generic method to speed up the process of joining two large datasets using LSH.	Semantic Scholar
The crux of our method lies in the way which we identify a set of representative points to reduce the number of LSH lookups.	Semantic Scholar
Theoretical analyzes show that our proposed method can greatly reduce the number of lookup operations and retain the same result accuracy compared to executing LSH lookups for every query point.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of our method by showing that the same principle can be applied to LSH algorithms for three different metrics: the Euclidean distance (QALSH), Jaccard similarity measure (MinHash), and Hamming distance (sequence hashing).	Semantic Scholar
Results from experimental studies using real datasets confirm our error analyzes and show significant improvements of our method over the state-of-the-art LSH method: to achieve over 0.95 recall, we only need to operate LSH lookups for at most 15 percent of the query points.	Semantic Scholar
Reliable and robust balancing controllers are key elements of whole-body control frameworks for humanoid robots.	Semantic Scholar
Passivity-based balancing controllers have been proposed and tested successfully in various scenarios involving different types of ground surfaces.	Semantic Scholar
This letter extends the passivity considerations for covering not only the robot and the controller but also the ground floor in order to guarantee an appropriate behavior, even when the underlying ground surface is not stable.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed extension is validated with experiments using the humanoid robot TOrque-controlled humanoid RObot (TORO).	Semantic Scholar
This paper investigates the distributed differential game tracking problem for nonlinear multi-agent systems with output constraint under a fixed directed graph.	Semantic Scholar
Each follower can be taken as strict-feedback structure with uncertain nonlinearities and input saturation.	Semantic Scholar
Firstly, by utilizing the command filtered backstepping technique, the distributed tracking control problem of multi-agent systems in strict-feedback form can be transformed into an equivalent distributed differential game problem of tracking error dynamics in affine form by designing a distributed feedforward tracking controller, in which neural networks (NNs) and the auxiliary system are introduced to deal with the unknown nonlinearities and input saturation, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
Especially, a novel barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is firstly introduced to tackle with the output constraint.	Semantic Scholar
Subsequently, by using adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) technique, the distributed zero-sum differential game strategy is derived, in which a critic network is constructed to approximate the cooperative cost function online with a novel updating law.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, the whole distributed control scheme not only guarantees the closed-loop signals to be cooperatively uniformly ultimately bounded (CUUB), but also ensures the cooperative cost function to be minimized.	Semantic Scholar
Meanwhile, the output constraint and input saturation are not violated.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
We investigate the use of Deep Neural Networks for the classification of image datasets where texture features are important for generating class-conditional discriminative representations.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we first derive the size of the feature space for some standard textural features extracted from the input dataset and then use the theory of Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension to show that hand-crafted feature extraction creates low-dimensional representations which help in reducing the overall excess error rate.	Semantic Scholar
As a corollary to this analysis, we derive for the first time upper bounds on the VC dimension of Convolutional Neural Network as well as Dropout and Dropconnect networks and the relation between excess error rate of Dropout and Dropconnect networks.	Semantic Scholar
The concept of intrinsic dimension is used to validate the intuition that texture-based datasets are inherently higher dimensional as compared to handwritten digits or other object recognition datasets and hence more difficult to be shattered by neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
We then derive the mean distance from the centroid to the nearest and farthest sampling points in an n-dimensional manifold and show that the Relative Contrast of the sample data vanishes as dimensionality of the underlying vector space tends to infinity.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we address the problem of cooperative mapping (CM) using datasets collected by multiple users at different times, when the transformation between the users’ starting poses is unknown.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we formulate CM as a constrained optimization problem, in which each user's independently estimated trajectory and map are merged together by imposing geometric constraints between commonly observed point and line features.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, we provide an algorithm for efficiently solving the CM problem, by taking advantage of its structure.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed solution is proven to be batch-least-squares (BLS) optimal over all users’ datasets, while it is less memory demanding and lends itself to parallel implementations.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, our solution is shown to be faster than the standard BLS solution, when the overlap between the users’ data is small.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, our algorithm is resource-aware as it is able to consistently trade accuracy for lower processing cost, by retaining only an informative subset of the common-feature constraints.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results based on visual and inertial measurements collected from multiple users within large buildings are used to assess the performance of the proposed CM algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Plenoptic cameras capture the directional information of the light distribution from a scene.	Semantic Scholar
This is accomplished by positioning a microlens array between the main lens and the sensor.	Semantic Scholar
This configuration obtains multiple projections for a point in the object space, which allows to retrieve the point’s depth on a single exposure.	Semantic Scholar
In recent years, several studies recover depth and shape from the lightfield data using several cues.	Semantic Scholar
Nonetheless, references regarding the depth capabilities of a standard plenoptic camera with different zoom and focus settings are scarce.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we formalize a forward projection model and consider projection geometry cues to improve a metric reconstruction methodology for a calibrated standard plenoptic camera.	Semantic Scholar
The metric reconstruction methodology is used to evaluate the depth estimation accuracy under certain zoom and focus settings.	Semantic Scholar
The reconstruction is applied to new datasets captured for this purpose with objects placed at depths between 0.05 and 2.00 meters.	Semantic Scholar
The results indicate that these cameras are able to reconstruct accurately points within the depth range analyzed by appropriately choosing the zoom and focus depth settings.	Semantic Scholar
The zoom is a determinant factor on the reconstruction accuracy and the focus depth allows to determine the reconstruction depth range.	Semantic Scholar

This letter is based on the inverse perspective mapping technique combined with a road lanes detection algorithm capable of detecting straight and curved lanes.	Semantic Scholar
Then, a clothoid model is used to extract pertinent information from the detected road markers.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the performance of the proposed approach is illustrated through simulations carried out with the well-known motorcycle simulator “BikeSim.” The results are very promising since the algorithm is capable of estimating, in real time, the road geometry and the vehicle location with a better accuracy than the one given by the commercial GPS.

We present a generic data-driven method to address the problem of manipulating a three-dimensional (3-D) compliant object (CO) with heterogeneous physical properties in the presence of unknown disturbances.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we do not assume a prior knowledge about the deformation behavior of the CO and type of the disturbance (e.g., internal or external).	Semantic Scholar
We also do not impose any constraints on the CO's physical properties (e.g., shape, mass, and stiffness).	Semantic Scholar
The proposed optimal iterative algorithm incorporates the provided visual feedback data to simultaneously learn and estimate the deformation behavior of the CO in order to accomplish the desired control objective.	Semantic Scholar
To demonstrate the capabilities and robustness of our algorithm, we fabricated two novel heterogeneous compliant phantoms and performed experiments on the da Vinci Research Kit.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results demonstrated the adaptivity, robustness, and accuracy of the proposed method and, therefore, its suitability for a variety of medical and industrial applications involving CO manipulation.	Semantic Scholar
"To address the classical selectivity estimation problem for OLAP queries in relational databases, a radically different approach called <monospace>PlanBouquet</monospace> was recently proposed in <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref1""> [1]</xref> , wherein the estimation process is completely abandoned and replaced with a calibrated discovery mechanism."	Semantic Scholar
The beneficial outcome of this new construction is that provable guarantees on worst-case performance, measured as Maximum Sub-Optimality (<italic>MSO</italic>), are obtained thereby facilitating robust query processing.	Semantic Scholar
The <monospace> PlanBouquet</monospace> formulation suffers, however, from a systemic drawback—the MSO bound is a function of not only the query, but also the optimizer's behavioral profile over the underlying database platform.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, there are adverse consequences: (i) the bound value becomes highly variable, depending on the specifics of the current operating environment, and (ii) it becomes infeasible to compute the value without substantial investments in preprocessing overheads.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we first present <monospace>SpillBound</monospace>, a new query processing algorithm that retains the core strength of the <monospace>PlanBouquet</monospace> discovery process, but reduces the bound dependency to only the query.	Semantic Scholar
It does so by incorporating plan termination and selectivity monitoring mechanisms in the database engine.	Semantic Scholar
"Specifically, <monospace>SpillBound</monospace> delivers a worst-case multiplicative bound, of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$D^2+3D$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""venkatesh-ieq1-2664827.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$D$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""venkatesh-ieq2-2664827.gif""/> </alternatives></inline-formula> is simply the number of error-prone predicates in the user query."	Semantic Scholar
Consequently, the bound value becomes independent of the optimizer and the database platform, and the guarantee can be issued simply by query inspection.	Semantic Scholar
"We go on to prove that <monospace>SpillBound</monospace> is within an <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$O(D)$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""venkatesh-ieq3-2664827.gif""/> </alternatives></inline-formula> factor of the <italic>best possible</italic> deterministic selectivity discovery algorithm in its class."	Semantic Scholar
We next devise techniques to bridge this quadratic-to-linear MSO gap by introducing the notion of <italic>contour alignment</italic>, a characterization of the nature of plan structures along the <italic> boundaries</italic> of the selectivity space.	Semantic Scholar
"Specifically, we propose a variant of <monospace>SpillBound</monospace>, called <monospace>AlignedBound</monospace>, which exploits the alignment property and provides a guarantee in the range <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mathbf {[2D+2,D^2+3D]}$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""venkatesh-ieq4-2664827.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula>."	Semantic Scholar
Finally, a detailed empirical evaluation over the standard decision-support benchmarks indicates that: (i) <monospace>SpillBound </monospace> provides markedly superior performance w.r.t.	Semantic Scholar
"MSO as compared to <monospace>PlanBouquet</monospace>, and (ii) <monospace>AlignedBound</monospace> provides additional benefits for query instances that are challenging for <monospace>SpillBound</monospace>, often coming close to the ideal of MSO linearity in <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$D$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""venkatesh-ieq5-2664827.gif""/> </alternatives></inline-formula>."	Semantic Scholar
From an absolute perspective, <monospace>AlignedBound</monospace> evaluates virtually all the benchmark queries considered in our study with MSO of around <bold>10</bold> or lesser.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, in an overall sense, <monospace>SpillBound</monospace> and <monospace>AlignedBound</monospace> offer a substantive step forward in the long-standing quest for robust query processing.	Semantic Scholar
Sociologists have long converged that the evolution of a Social Networking  Service(SNS) is driven by the interplay between users’ preferences (reflected in user-item interaction behavior) and the social network structure (reflected in user-user interaction behavior).	Semantic Scholar
Nevertheless, traditional approaches either modeled these two kinds of behaviors in isolation or relied on a static assumption of a SNS.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, it is still unclear how do the roles of the dynamic social network structure and users’ historical preferences affect the evolution of SNSs.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, can transforming the underlying social theories in the platform evolution modeling process benefit both behavior prediction tasks?	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we incorporate the underlying social theories to explain and model the evolution of users’ two kinds of behaviors in SNSs.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we present two kinds of representations for users’ behaviors: a direct (latent) representation that presumes users’ behaviors are represented directly (latently) by their historical behaviors.	Semantic Scholar
Under each representation, we associate each user's two kinds of behaviors with two vectors at each time.	Semantic Scholar
Then, for each representation, we propose the corresponding learning model to fuse the interplay between users’ two kinds of behaviors.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed models for both user preference prediction and social link suggestion.	Semantic Scholar
It is well-known that exploiting label correlations is important to multi-label learning.	Semantic Scholar
Existing approaches either assume that the label correlations are global and shared by all instances; or that the label correlations are local and shared only by a data subset.	Semantic Scholar
In fact, in the real-world applications, both cases may occur that some label correlations are globally applicable and some are shared only in a local group of instances.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, it is also a usual case that only partial labels are observed, which makes the exploitation of the label correlations much more difficult.	Semantic Scholar
That is, it is hard to estimate the label correlations when many labels are absent.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a new multi-label approach GLOCAL dealing with both the full-label and the missing-label cases, exploiting global and local label correlations simultaneously, through learning a latent label representation and optimizing label manifolds.	Semantic Scholar
The extensive experimental studies validate the effectiveness of our approach on both full-label and missing-label data.	Semantic Scholar
Shortest path query is one of the most fundamental and classic problems in graph analytics, which returns the complete shortest path between any two vertices.	Semantic Scholar
However, in many real-life scenarios, only critical vertices on the shortest path are desirable and it is unnecessary to search for the complete path.	Semantic Scholar

The significance of the vertices can be predefined.	Semantic Scholar
The key strategy for seeking the sketch is to apply off-line preprocessed distance oracle to accelerate on-line real-time queries.	Semantic Scholar
This allows us to omit unnecessary vertices and obtain the most representative sketch of the shortest path directly.	Semantic Scholar

Experiments on large-scale real-world networks validate that our algorithms are of high efficiency and accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose an approach for merging three-dimensional maps represented as pose graphs of point clouds.	Semantic Scholar
Our method can effectively deal with typical distortions affecting simultaneous localization and mapping-generated maps.	Semantic Scholar
Traditional map merging techniques that use a single rigid body transformation to relate the reference frames of different maps.	Semantic Scholar
Instead, our approach achieves more accurate results by eliminating the inconsistencies resulting from distortions affecting the inputs, and can succeed in those situations where traditional approaches fail for substantial deformations.	Semantic Scholar
The core idea behind our solution is to localize the robot in a reference map by using the data from another map as observations.	Semantic Scholar
We validated our approach on publicly available datasets, and provide quantitative results that confirm its effectiveness on challenging instances of the merging problem.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a Deep Learning approach to the visual question answering task, where machines answer to questions about real-world images.	Semantic Scholar
By combining latest advances in image representation and natural language processing, we propose Ask Your Neurons, a scalable, jointly trained, end-to-end formulation to this problem.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to previous efforts, we are facing a multi-modal problem where the language output (answer) is conditioned on visual and natural language inputs (image and question).	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our approaches on the DAQUAR as well as the VQA dataset where we also report various baselines, including an analysis how much information is contained in the language part only.	Semantic Scholar
To study human consensus, we propose two novel metrics and collect additional answers which extend the original DAQUAR dataset to DAQUAR-Consensus.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we evaluate a rich set of design choices how to encode, combine and decode information in our proposed Deep Learning formulation.	Semantic Scholar
A social approach can be exploited for the Internet of Things (IoT) to manage a large number of connected objects.	Semantic Scholar
These objects operate as autonomous agents to request and provide information and services to users.	Semantic Scholar
Establishing trustworthy relationships among the objects greatly improves the effectiveness of node interaction in the social IoT and helps nodes overcome perceptions of uncertainty and risk.	Semantic Scholar
However, there are limitations in the existing trust models.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a comprehensive model of trust is proposed that is tailored to the social IoT.	Semantic Scholar
The model includes ingredients such as trustor, trustee, goal, trustworthiness evaluation, decision, action, result, and context.	Semantic Scholar
Building on this trust model, we clarify the concepts of trust in the social IoT in five aspects such as: 1) mutuality of trustor and trustee; 2) inferential transfer of trust; 3) transitivity of trust; 4) trustworthiness update; and 5) trustworthiness affected by dynamic environment.	Semantic Scholar
With network connectivities that are from real-world social networks, a series of simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the social IoT operated with the proposed trust model.	Semantic Scholar
An experimental IoT network is used to further validate the proposed trust model.	Semantic Scholar

The basal ganglia are considered vital to action selection - a hypothesis supported by several biologically plausible computational models.	Semantic Scholar
Of the several subnuclei of the basal ganglia, the globus pallidus externa (GPe) has been thought of largely as a relay nucleus, and its intrinsic connectivity has not been incorporated in significant detail, in any model thus far.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we incorporate newly revealed subgroups of neurons within the GPe into an existing computational model of the basal ganglia, and investigate their role in action selection.	Semantic Scholar
Three main results ensued.	Semantic Scholar
First, using previously used metrics for selection, the new extended connectivity improved the action selection performance of the model.	Semantic Scholar
Second, low frequency theta oscillations were observed in the subpopulation of the GPe (the TA or 'arkypallidal' neurons) which project exclusively to the striatum.	Semantic Scholar
These oscillations were suppressed by increased dopamine activity - revealing a possible link with symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	Semantic Scholar
Third, a new phenomenon was observed in which the usual monotonic relationship between input to the basal ganglia and its output within an action 'channel' was, under some circumstances, reversed.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, at high levels of input, further increase of this input to the channel could cause an increase of the corresponding output rather than the more usually observed decrease.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, this phenomenon was associated with the prevention of multiple channel selection, thereby assisting in optimal action selection.	Semantic Scholar
Examination of the mechanistic origin of our results showed the so-called 'prototypical' GPe neurons to be the principal subpopulation influencing action selection.	Semantic Scholar
They control the striatum via the arkypallidal neurons and are also able to regulate the output nuclei directly.	Semantic Scholar
Taken together, our results highlight the role of the GPe as a major control hub of the basal ganglia, and provide a mechanistic account for its control function.	Semantic Scholar
Modeling and implementation of the nonlinear neural system with physiologically plausible dynamic behaviors are considerably meaningful in the field of computational neuroscience.	Semantic Scholar
This study introduces a novel hardware platform to investigate the dynamical behaviors within the nonlinear subthalamic nucleus-external globus pallidus system.	Semantic Scholar

Join query is one of the most fundamental database query types useful in relational database management systems.	Semantic Scholar
However, the available solutions so far have been beset by higher costs in comparison to other query types.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we develop a novel solution to accelerate the processing of sort-merge join queries with low match rates.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, our solution makes use of hierarchical indexes to identify result-yielding regions in the solution space in order to take advantage of result sparseness.	Semantic Scholar
Further, in addition to one-dimensional equi-join query processing, our solution supports processing of multidimensional similarity join queries.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that our solution is superior to the best existing method in a low match rate setting; the method achieves a speedup factor of 4.8 for join queries with a match rate of 5 percent.	Semantic Scholar
Within the area of multi-agent systems, normative systems are a widely used framework for the coordination of interdependent activities.	Semantic Scholar
A crucial problem associated with normative systems is that of synthesising norms that will effectively accomplish a coordination task and that the agents will comply with.	Semantic Scholar
Many works in the literature focus on the on-line synthesis of a single, evolutionarily stable norm (convention) whose compliance forms a rational choice for the agents and that effectively coordinates them in one particular coordination situation that needs to be identified and modelled as a game in advance.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we introduce a framework for the automatic off-line synthesis of evolutionarily stable normative systems that coordinate the agents in multiple interdependent coordination situations that cannot be easily identified in advance nor resolved separately.	Semantic Scholar
Our framework roots in evolutionary game theory.	Semantic Scholar
It considers multi-agent systems in which the potential conflict situations can be automatically enumerated by employing MAS simulations along with basic domain information.	Semantic Scholar
Our framework simulates an evolutionary process whereby successful norms prosper and spread within the agent population, while unsuccessful norms are discarded.	Semantic Scholar
The outputs of such a natural selection process are sets of codependent norms that, together, effectively coordinate the agents in multiple interdependent situations and are evolutionarily stable.	Semantic Scholar
We empirically show the effectiveness of our approach through empirical evaluation in a simulated traffic domain.	Semantic Scholar
Pose estimation, tracking, and action recognition of articulated objects from depth images are important and challenging problems, which are normally considered separately.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a unified paradigm based on Lie group theory is proposed, which enables us to collectively address these related problems.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach is also applicable to a wide range of articulated objects.	Semantic Scholar
Empirically it is evaluated on lab animals including mouse and fish, as well as on human hand.	Semantic Scholar
On these applications, it is shown to deliver competitive results compared to the state-of-the-arts, and non-trivial baselines including convolutional neural networks and regression forest methods.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, new sets of annotated depth data of articulated objects are created which, together with our code, are made publicly available.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce a novel data-driven approach to discover and decode features in the neural code coming from large population neural recordings with minimal assumptions, using cohomological feature extraction.	Semantic Scholar
We apply our approach to neural recordings of mice moving freely in a box, where we find a circular feature.	Semantic Scholar
We then observe that the decoded value corresponds well to the head direction of the mouse.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, we capture head direction cells and decode the head direction from the neural population activity without having to process the mouse's behavior.	Semantic Scholar
Interestingly, the decoded values convey more information about the neural activity than the tracked head direction does, with differences that have some spatial organization.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we note that the residual population activity, after the head direction has been accounted for, retains some low-dimensional structure that is correlated with the speed of the mouse.	Semantic Scholar
We investigate the problem of colourising a point cloud using an arbitrary mobile mapping device and an independent camera.	Semantic Scholar

In this paper, we propose MV-FTL, a multi-version flash transition layer (FTL) that provides page-level multi-version management.	Semantic Scholar
By extending a unique characteristic of solid-state drives (SSDs), the out-of-place (OoP) update to multi-version management, MV-FTL can both guarantee atomic page updates from each transaction and provide concurrency without requiring redundant log data writes as well.	Semantic Scholar
For evaluation, we first modified SQLite, a lightweight database management system (DBMS), to cooperate with MV-FTL.	Semantic Scholar
Owing to the architectural simplicity of SQLite, we clearly show that MV-FTL improves both the performance and the concurrency aspects of the system.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, to prove the effectiveness in a full-fledged enterprise-level DBMS, we modified MyRocks, a MySQL variant by Facebook, to use our new Patch Compaction algorithm, which deeply relies on MV-FTL.	Semantic Scholar
The TPC-C and LinkBench benchmark tests demonstrated that MV-FTL reduces the overall amount of writes, implying that MV-FTL can be effective in such DBMSs.	Semantic Scholar
Soft-bodied robots, due to their intrinsic compliance, have shown great potential for operating within unstructured environment and interacting with unknown objects.	Semantic Scholar
This letter deals with automatic design and fabrication of soft robots.	Semantic Scholar
From a structure point of view, we synthesize a soft cable-driven gripper by recasting its mechanical design as a topology optimization problem.	Semantic Scholar
Building on previous work on compliant mechanism optimization, we model the interactions between the gripper and objects more practically, in form of pressure loadings and friction tractions, and furthermore, we investigate how the interaction uncertainties affect the optimization solution by varying the contact location and area.	Semantic Scholar
The optimized soft fingers were three-dimensionally printed and then assembled to build a gripper.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments show that the gripper can handle a large range of unknown objects of different shapes and weights (up to 1 kg), with different grasping modes.	Semantic Scholar

Estimation of the temporal changes to a city is useful for city management, disaster recovery operations, and understanding natural phenomena.	Semantic Scholar
When several types of data are available for this task, the optimal type should be chosen depending on the changes that need to be detected.	Semantic Scholar
However, data of the desired type are not always available, particularly historical data.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we propose two methods for detecting changes in a city, which can be used in complement to process available data types and detect changes in selected targets.	Semantic Scholar
The first method estimates the presence of buildings by comparing street-level images and a 2D city map of buildings created at different points in time.	Semantic Scholar
This method uses the Structure from Motion (SfM) technique to reconstruct a point cloud of the structures of the city, and matches the point cloud with the 3D building structures recovered from its 2D map.	Semantic Scholar
While 2D city maps are available for most cities, most are not very accurate.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, this method is designed to overcome these inaccuracies and thus is widely applicable.	Semantic Scholar
On the other hand, the method cannot detect the following types of scene change: wall paintings, buildings that were reconstructed and closely restored to their previous shape, pedestrians, cars, and vegetation.	Semantic Scholar
The second method uses a pair of street-level images that are roughly aligned with GPS data collected at different points in time to detect such scene changes.	Semantic Scholar
This method uses the features of a convolutional neural network (CNN) in combination with superpixel segmentation to address inaccurate image alignment and it also enables change detection with pixel-level accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, the second method is scalable for large-scale estimation because it can quickly detect scene changes by merely using an image pair without performing large-scale SfM.	Semantic Scholar
The authors consider the proper use of these two methods to enable temporal city modeling in various situations.	Semantic Scholar
We experimentally apply these methods to cities damaged by the tsunami that struck Japan in 2011 and the results show their effectiveness.	Semantic Scholar

We propose the ambiguity problem for the foreground object segmentation task and motivate the importance of estimating and accounting for this ambiguity when designing vision systems.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we distinguish between images which lead multiple annotators to segment different foreground objects (ambiguous) versus minor inter-annotator differences of the same object.	Semantic Scholar
Taking images from eight widely used datasets, we crowdsource labeling the images as “ambiguous” or “not ambiguous” to segment in order to construct a new dataset we call STATIC.	Semantic Scholar
Using STATIC, we develop a system that automatically predicts which images are ambiguous.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments demonstrate the advantage of our prediction system over existing saliency-based methods on images from vision benchmarks and images taken by blind people who are trying to recognize objects in their environment.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we introduce a crowdsourcing system to achieve cost savings for collecting the diversity of all valid “ground truth” foreground object segmentations by collecting extra segmentations only when ambiguity is expected.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments show our system eliminates up to 47% of human effort compared to existing crowdsourcing methods with no loss in capturing the diversity of ground truths.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents the use of shape memory alloy (SMA) spring actuators with real-time cooling to control the motion of the minimally invasive neurosurgical intracranial robot (MINIR-II).	Semantic Scholar
A new actuation mechanism involving the passage of water as the cooling medium and air as the medium to drive out the water has been developed to facilitate real-time control of the springs.	Semantic Scholar
Control parameters, such as current, water flow rates, SMA predisplacement, and gauge pressure of the compressed air, are identified from the SMA thermal model and from the actuation mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
In-depth modeling and characterization have been performed regarding these parameters to optimize the robot motion speed.	Semantic Scholar
Forced water cooling has also been compared with forced air cooling and proved to be the superior method to achieve higher robot speed.	Semantic Scholar
An improved robot design and a magnetic-resonance-imaging-compatible experimental platform have been developed for the implementation of the actuation mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
Cable-driven robots enable compact design by allowing actuators to be mounted away from joints.	Semantic Scholar
This kind of actuation is desired in surgical robots.	Semantic Scholar
The cables in these robots must remain under tension at all times in order to have optimum performance.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, the knowledge of initial value of cable tension is significant.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, in surgery, haptic feedback is vital for diagnosis of healthy tissue and to prevent damaging tissue with excessive force.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, cable pretension was estimated indirectly by estimating stiffness parameter of cables.	Semantic Scholar
Then, external forces acting on the robot were estimated in all four quadrants by using cable stretch and dynamic-based methods utilizing system dynamics and unscented Kalman filter (UKF).	Semantic Scholar
We assessed the effectiveness of these methods on the third link of Raven-II surgical robot platform.	Semantic Scholar
From experiments with the tension estimation technique, it can be determined if the cable pretension is in the safe range.	Semantic Scholar
Also, both the cable stretch and UKF-based methods can be used to estimate external forces on all quadrants.	Semantic Scholar

The proposed approach has been experimentally validated on a robotic arm (i.e., the Kuka LWR4+) attached to a human subject wrist.	Semantic Scholar
Two experimental sessions have been carried out in order to: 1) evaluate the differences between our approach and the one proposed in “Dynamical movement primitives: Learning attractor models for motor behaviors” (A. J. Ijspeert et al., Neural Comput., 2013) in terms of reconstruction error between the demonstrated trajectory and the learned one, and in terms of memory size required to record the database of DMP parameters; and 2) measure the generalization level of the proposed system with respect to the variation of the object positions by evaluating the success rate of the task execution.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach allows 1) reproducing the user's personal motion style with high accuracy and 2) efficiently generalizing with respect to the change of object position.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, a significant reduction of memory allocation for the database can be achieved, with a consequent significant computational time saving.	Semantic Scholar

By employing a suitable Lyapunov functional candidate, we derive some new delay independent sufficient conditions for the global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point for the neutral-type Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with time delays.	Semantic Scholar
The obtained stability conditions can be completely characterized by the networks parameters of the neutral systems under consideration.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, it is easy to verify the applicability of our results by simply using some algebraic manipulations of the conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Some numerical examples are also given to show the effectiveness of the derived analytical results.	Semantic Scholar

A theoretical and experimental analysis related to the effect of noise in the task of vertex identification in unknown shapes is presented.	Semantic Scholar
Shapes are seen as real functions of their closed boundary.	Semantic Scholar
An alternative global perspective of curvature is examined providing insight into the process of noise-enabled vertex localization.	Semantic Scholar
The analysis reveals that noise facilitates in the localization of certain vertices.	Semantic Scholar
The concept of noising is thus considered and a relevant global method for localizing Global Vertices is investigated in relation to local methods under the presence of increasing noise.	Semantic Scholar
Theoretical analysis reveals that induced noise can indeed help localizing certain vertices if combined with global descriptors.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments with noise and a comparison to localized methods validate the theoretical results.	Semantic Scholar
Many domain-specific websites host a profile page for each entity (e.g., locations on Foursquare, movies on IMDb, and products on Amazon) for users to post comments on.	Semantic Scholar
When commenting on an entity, users often mention other entities for reference or comparison.	Semantic Scholar
Compared with web pages and tweets, the problem of disambiguating the mentioned entities in user comments has not received much attention.	Semantic Scholar
This paper investigates linking fine-grained locations in Foursquare comments.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate that the focal location, i.e., the location that a comment is posted on, provides rich contexts for the linking task.	Semantic Scholar
To exploit such information, we represent the Foursquare data in a graph, which includes locations, comments, and their relations.	Semantic Scholar
A probabilistic model named FocalLink  is proposed to estimate the probability that a user mentions a location when commenting on a focal location, by following different kinds of relations.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that FocalLink is consistently superior under different collective linking settings.	Semantic Scholar
Our understanding of neural population coding has been limited by a lack of analysis methods to characterize spiking data from large populations.	Semantic Scholar
The biggest challenge comes from the fact that the number of possible network activity patterns scales exponentially with the number of neurons recorded ().	Semantic Scholar
Here we introduce a new statistical method for characterizing neural population activity that requires semi-independent fitting of only as many parameters as the square of the number of neurons, requiring drastically smaller data sets and minimal computation time.	Semantic Scholar
The model works by matching the population rate (the number of neurons synchronously active) and the probability that each individual neuron fires given the population rate.	Semantic Scholar
We found that this model can accurately fit synthetic data from up to 1000 neurons.	Semantic Scholar
We also found that the model could rapidly decode visual stimuli from neural population data from macaque primary visual cortex about 65 ms after stimulus onset.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we used the model to estimate the entropy of neural population activity in developing mouse somatosensory cortex and, surprisingly, found that it first increases, and then decreases during development.	Semantic Scholar
This statistical model opens new options for interrogating neural population data and can bolster the use of modern large-scale in vivo Ca and voltage imaging tools.	Semantic Scholar
Locomotion of legged robots on arbitrary terrain using multiple contacts is yet an open problem.	Semantic Scholar
To tackle it, a common approach is to rely on reduced template models (e.g., the linear inverted pendulum).	Semantic Scholar
However, most of existing template models are based on some restrictive hypotheses that limit their range of applications.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, reduced models are generally not able to cope with the constraints of the robot complete model, such as the kinematic limits.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a complete solution relying on a generic template model, based on the centroidal dynamics, able to quickly compute multicontact locomotion trajectories for any legged robot on arbitrary terrains.	Semantic Scholar
The template model relies on exact dynamics and is thus not limited by arbitrary assumption.	Semantic Scholar
We also propose a generic procedure to handle feasibility constraints due to the robot's whole body as occupancy measures, and a systematic way to approximate them using offline learning in simulation.	Semantic Scholar
An efficient solver is finally obtained by introducing an original second-order approximation of the centroidal wrench cone.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness and the versatility of the approach are demonstrated in several multicontact scenarios with two humanoid robots both in reality and in simulation.	Semantic Scholar
Snake robots offer a useful and unique mobility platform for search-and-rescue applications.	Semantic Scholar
However, existing prototypes made of rigid links and joints are hampered by a lack of flexibility that limits their utility in highly cluttered, maze-like environments, and their heavy weight limits their energy-efficiency and performance in three-dimensional (3-D) tasks.	Semantic Scholar
To address these challenges, this letter presents a new approach using cylindrical, origami continuum modules driven by internal cables and electric motors, as well as a local feedback control system on each module.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, we can distribute actuation, sensing, and control for highly scalable soft robotic continuum origami systems.	Semantic Scholar
Using this approach, we develop a 3-D origami robotic snake that is able to locomote using lateral undulation and sidewinding gaits similar to those used by biological snakes.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed snake robot is a continuously deformable, lightweight, modular, and low cost robotic system made of a folded thin plastic body.	Semantic Scholar
We detail the design, fabrication, and control of this first 3-D origami robotic snake prototype, focusing on the analysis of locomotion parameters for each gait.	Semantic Scholar
We experimentally search for the optimal parameters for both types of locomotion, with maximum speeds characterized as 40.5 mm/s (0.1 body-lengths per second) for lateral undulation and 35 mm/s (0.09 body-lengths per second) for sidewinding locomotion.	Semantic Scholar

The rise of herbicide resistant weed species has re-invigorated research in nonchemical methods for weed management.	Semantic Scholar
Robots, such as AgBot II, that can detect and classify weeds as they traverse a field are a key enabling factor for individualised treatment of weed species.	Semantic Scholar
Integral to the invidualized treatment of weed species are the the nonherbicide methods through which the weeds are managed.	Semantic Scholar
This letter explores mechanical methods as an alternative to weed management.	Semantic Scholar
Three implements are considered: below-surface tilling (arrow hoe), above-surface tilling (tines), and a cutting mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
These mechanisms were evaluated in a controlled field with varying rates of application to herbicide-resistant weeds of interest for Queensland, Australia.	Semantic Scholar
Statistical analysis demonstrated the efficacy of these implements and highlighted the importance of early intervention.	Semantic Scholar

Technological advances are being made to assist humans in performing ordinary tasks in everyday settings.	Semantic Scholar
A key issue is the interaction with objects of varying size, shape, and degree of mobility.	Semantic Scholar
Autonomous assistive robots must be provided with the ability to process visual data in real time so that they can react adequately for quickly adapting to changes in the environment.	Semantic Scholar
Reliable object detection and recognition is usually a necessary early step to achieve this goal.	Semantic Scholar
In spite of significant research achievements, this issue still remains a challenge when real-life scenarios are considered.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we present a vision system for assistive robots that is able to detect and recognize objects from a visual input in ordinary environments in real time.	Semantic Scholar
The system computes color, motion, and shape cues, combining them in a probabilistic manner to accurately achieve object detection and recognition, taking some inspiration from vision science.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, with the purpose of processing the input visual data in real time, a graphical processing unit (GPU) has been employed.	Semantic Scholar
The presented approach has been implemented and evaluated on a humanoid robot torso located at realistic scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
For further experimental validation, a public image repository for object recognition has been used, allowing a quantitative comparison with respect to other state-of-the-art techniques when realworld scenes are considered.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, a temporal analysis of the performance is provided with respect to image resolution and the number of target objects in the scene.	Semantic Scholar
Shape from shading (SfS) and stereo are two fundamentally different strategies for image-based 3-D reconstruction.	Semantic Scholar
While approaches for SfS infer the depth solely from pixel intensities, methods for stereo are based on a matching process that establishes correspondences across images.	Semantic Scholar
This difference in approaching the reconstruction problem yields complementary advantages that are worthwhile being combined.	Semantic Scholar
So far, however, most “joint” approaches are based on an initial stereo mesh that is subsequently refined using shading information.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we follow a completely different approach.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a joint variational method that combines both cues within a single minimisation framework.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we fuse a Lambertian SfS approach with a robust stereo model and supplement the resulting energy functional with a detail-preserving anisotropic second-order smoothness term.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we extend the resulting model in such a way that it jointly estimates depth, albedo and illumination.	Semantic Scholar
This in turn makes the approach applicable to objects with non-uniform albedo as well as to scenes with unknown illumination.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments for synthetic and real-world images demonstrate the benefits of our combined approach: They not only show that our method is capable of generating very detailed reconstructions, but also that joint approaches are feasible in practice.	Semantic Scholar
Label ordering, the specification of subset–superset relationships for segmentation labels, has been of increasing interest in image segmentation as they allow for complex regions to be represented as a collection of simple parts.	Semantic Scholar
Recent advances in continuous max-flow segmentation have widely expanded the possible label orderings from binary background/foreground problems to extendable frameworks in which the label ordering can be specified.	Semantic Scholar
This article presents Directed Acyclic Graph Max-Flow image segmentation which is flexible enough to incorporate any label ordering without constraints.	Semantic Scholar
This framework uses augmented Lagrangian multipliers and primal–dual optimization to develop a highly parallelized solver implemented using GPGPU.	Semantic Scholar
This framework is validated on synthetic, natural, and medical images illustrating its general applicability.	Semantic Scholar
Several methods have been proposed by researchers to detect cyber attacks in Cyber–Physical Systems (CPSs).	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a comprehensive approach for conducting experiments to assess the effectiveness of such methods in the context of a robot (Amigobot) that includes both cyber and physical components.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach includes a method for performing vulnerability analysis, several methods for attack detection, and guidelines for conducting experimental studies in the context of cyber security.	Semantic Scholar
The method for vulnerability analysis makes use of the Failure-Attack-CounTermeasure (FACT) graph.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental study to evaluate methods for attack detection comprises of three experiments.	Semantic Scholar
These methods have been implemented and evaluated, within and across all three experiments, with respect to their effectiveness, detection speed, and durability for injection, scaling, and stealthy attacks.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed guidelines define key phases and artifacts for conducting such experiments and are an adaptation of those used in Software Engineering.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes deployment strategies for consumer unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to maximize the stationary coverage of a target area and to guarantee the continuity of the service through energy replenishment operations at ground charging stations.	Semantic Scholar
The three main contributions of our work are as follows.	Semantic Scholar
1) A centralized optimal solution is proposed for the joint problem of UAV positioning for a target coverage ratio and scheduling the charging operations of the UAVs that involves travel to the ground station.	Semantic Scholar
2) A distributed game-theory-based scheduling strategy is proposed using normal-form games with rigorous analysis on performance bounds.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, a bio-inspired scheme using attractive/repulsive spring actions are used for distributed positioning of the UAVs.	Semantic Scholar
3) The cost-benefit tradeoffs of different levels of cooperation among the UAVs for the distributed charging operations is analyzed.	Semantic Scholar
This paper demonstrates that the distributed deployment using only 1-hop messaging achieves approximation of the centrally computed optimum, in terms of coverage and lifetime.	Semantic Scholar
Dressing is a fundamental task of everyday living and robots offer an opportunity to assist people with motor impairments.	Semantic Scholar
While several robotic systems have explored robot-assisted dressing, few have considered how a robot can manage errors in human pose estimation, or adapt to human motion in real time during dressing assistance.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, estimating pose changes due to human motion can be challenging with vision-based techniques since dressing is often intended to visually occlude the body with clothing.	Semantic Scholar
We present a method to track a person's pose in real time using capacitive proximity sensing.	Semantic Scholar
This sensing approach gives direct estimates of distance with low latency, has a high signal-to-noise ratio, and has low computational requirements.	Semantic Scholar
Using our method, a robot can adjust for errors in the estimated pose of a person and physically follow the contours and movements of the person while providing dressing assistance.	Semantic Scholar
As part of an evaluation of our method, the robot successfully pulled the sleeve of a hospital gown and a cardigan onto the right arms of 10 human participants, despite arm motions and large errors in the initially estimated pose of the person's arm.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that a capacitive sensor is unaffected by visual occlusion of the body and can sense a person's body through cotton clothing.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes the first derivation, implementation, and experimental validation of light field image-based visual servoing.	Semantic Scholar
Light field image Jacobians are derived based on a compact light field feature representation that is close to the form measured directly by light field cameras.	Semantic Scholar
We also enhance feature detection and correspondence by enforcing light field geometry constraints, and directly estimate the image Jacobian without knowledge of point depth.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach is implemented over a standard visual servoing control loop, and applied to a custom-mirror-based light field camera mounted on a robotic arm.	Semantic Scholar
Light field image-based visual servoing is then validated in both simulation and experiment.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the proposed method outperforms conventional monocular and stereo image-based visual servoing under field-of-view constraints and occlusions.	Semantic Scholar

This article describes our technical approach regarding the tricycle, the stimulator, and the inertial-sensor-based control strategy used for training and during the race.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the cycling device's independence, the same setting and stimulation pattern can be used for either regular or ergometer-based cycling.	Semantic Scholar
Regarding the bike architecture, the focus was on using standard components as much as possible and enabling an easy and autonomous transfer between the wheelchair and the tricycle.	Semantic Scholar
Together with our paraplegic pilot [spinal cord injury (SCI) lesion level T5/6, American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale Grade A], we developed a training plan and an electrode setting that was continuously improved upon over the course of 18 months.	Semantic Scholar

At the Cybathlon, our athlete completed the 750-m race, taking fourth place with a new personal record of 6 min and 44 s. With our work, we showed that an inertial-sensor-based joint-angle estimation can be used for smooth and effective FES cycling.	Semantic Scholar
Crowdsourcing has been shown to be effective in a wide range of applications, and is seeing increasing use.	Semantic Scholar
A large-scale crowdsourcing task often consists of thousands or millions of atomic tasks, each of which is usually a simple task such as binary choice or simple voting.	Semantic Scholar
To distribute a large-scale crowdsourcing task to limited crowd workers, a common practice is to pack a set of atomic tasks into a task bin and send to a crowd worker in a batch.	Semantic Scholar
It is challenging to decompose a large-scale crowdsourcing task and execute batches of atomic tasks, which ensures reliable answers at a minimal total cost.	Semantic Scholar
Large batches lead to unreliable answers of atomic tasks, while small batches incur unnecessary cost.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we investigate a general crowdsourcing task decomposition problem, called the Smart Large-scAle task DE composer (SLADE) problem, which aims to decompose a large-scale crowdsourcing task to achieve the desired reliability at a minimal cost.	Semantic Scholar
We prove the NP-hardness of the SLADE problem and propose solutions in both  homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
For the homogeneous SLADE problem, where all the atomic tasks share the same reliability requirement, we propose a greedy heuristic algorithm and an efficient and effective approximation framework using an optimal priority queue (OPQ) structure with provable approximation ratio.	Semantic Scholar
For the heterogeneous SLADE problem, where the atomic tasks can have different reliability requirements, we extend the OPQ-based framework leveraging a partition strategy, and also prove its approximation guarantee.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solutions through extensive experiments on representative crowdsourcing platforms.	Semantic Scholar

The pathway to the maxillary sinus is anatomically curved and narrow.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, the conventional approach using a straight endoscope and surgical tools is difficult to diagnose and treat some blind regions of the maxillary sinus through the nostrils.	Semantic Scholar
Such cases are usually dealt with by an approach with an external incision that causes large invasive surgery.	Semantic Scholar
In order to approach the blind regions without any external incision, a new bendable device and an image-guided robotic approach for the maxillary sinus surgery are required.	Semantic Scholar
This work reports design, development, and validation of an image-guided dual master–slave robotic system for the maxillary sinus surgery.	Semantic Scholar
Initially, specifications of the robotic system for sinus surgery are decided by analysis of the anatomical structure of the sinus.	Semantic Scholar
A method for determining the design parameters of continuum type salve robot is also presented.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the specifications and the design parameter determining method, a compact design of bendable dual slave robotic system for inspection and biopsy operation of the maxillary sinus area is devised and workspace analysis for verifying the robot design is conducted.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of the dual master–slave system equipped with flexible devices is validated through several phantom tests.	Semantic Scholar
The results suggest that bendable end-effectors and navigation software are useful to navigate and treat blind regions inside general sinus areas as well as the maxillary sinus.	Semantic Scholar
User preferences play a significant role in market analysis.	Semantic Scholar
In the database literature, there has been extensive work on query primitives, such as the well known top-k query that can be used for the ranking of products based on the preferences customers have expressed.	Semantic Scholar
Still, the fundamental operation that evaluates the similarity between products is typically done ignoring these preferences.	Semantic Scholar
Instead products are depicted in a feature space based on their attributes and similarity is computed via traditional distance metrics on that space.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we utilize the rankings of the products based on the opinions of their customers in order to map the products in a user-centric space where similarity calculations are performed.	Semantic Scholar
We identify important properties of this mapping that result in upper and lower similarity bounds, which in turn permit us to utilize conventional multidimensional indexes on the original product space in order to perform these user-centric similarity computations.	Semantic Scholar
We show how interesting similarity calculations that are motivated by the commonly used range and nearest neighbor queries can be performed efficiently, while pruning significant parts of the data set based on the bounds we derive on the user-centric similarity of products.	Semantic Scholar
We consider the problem of finding grasp contacts that are optimal under a given grasp quality function on arbitrary objects.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach formulates a framework for contact-level grasping as a path finding problem in the space of supercontact grasps.	Semantic Scholar
The initial supercontact grasp contains all grasps and in each step along a path grasps are removed.	Semantic Scholar
For this, we introduce and formally characterize search space structure and cost functions under which minimal cost paths correspond to optimal grasps.	Semantic Scholar
Our formulation avoids expensive exhaustive search and reduces computational cost by several orders of magnitude.	Semantic Scholar
We present admissible heuristic functions and exploit approximate heuristic search to further reduce the computational cost while maintaining  bounded suboptimality for resulting grasps.	Semantic Scholar
We exemplify our formulation with point-contact grasping for which we define domain specific heuristics and demonstrate optimality and bounded suboptimality by comparing against exhaustive and uniform cost search on example objects.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we explain how to restrict the search graph to satisfy grasp constraints for modeling hand kinematics.	Semantic Scholar
We also analyze our algorithm empirically in terms of created and visited search states and resultant effective branching factor.	Semantic Scholar
To accomplish more ambitious scientific goals of interplanetary nanosatellite missions, a certain set of technological challenges need to be addressed to enhance systems performance.	Semantic Scholar
An area of particular interest is mission autonomy.	Semantic Scholar
Increasing the degree of mission autonomy might help overcoming the limitations imposed by the typical low data rate and the simplified ground segment of small missions.	Semantic Scholar
This research aims at supporting the development of more autonomous spacecraft by exploiting the potentialities of artificial intelligence.	Semantic Scholar
An artificial neural network is proposed to enable a set of autonomous operations, for example to select what payload data are useful for the mission and must be sent to Earth, and what data can be discarded.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm is developed and tested on a case study represented by a CubeSat mission to a near Earth asteroid that requires the autonomous detection of an impact event on the asteroid surface.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed algorithm demonstrates the feasibility of a novel training approach based on optimized datasets created directly in-situ using images taken by the spacecraft on-board camera.	Semantic Scholar
The validity of the algorithm is demonstrated through several simulations, considering different scenarios and disturbances.	Semantic Scholar
The research presented in this paper can be extended to other applications of the artificial neural networks, such as autonomous failure detection and isolation, also in conjunction with other artificial intelligence approaches.	Semantic Scholar
A key prerequisite for planning manipulation together with locomotion of humanoids in complex environments is to find a valid end-pose with a feasible stance location and a full-body configuration that is balanced and collision-free.	Semantic Scholar
Prior work based on the inverse dynamic reachability map assumed that the feet are placed next to each other around the stance location on a horizontal plane, and the success rate was correlated with the coverage density of the sampled space, which in turn is limited by the memory required for storing the map.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a framework that uses a paired forward-inverse dynamic reachability map to exploit a greater modularity of the robot's inherent kinematic structure.	Semantic Scholar
The combinatorics of this novel decomposition allows greater coverage in the high-dimensional configuration space while reducing the number of stored samples.	Semantic Scholar
This permits drawing samples from a much richer dataset to effectively plan end-poses for both single-handed and bimanual tasks on uneven terrains.	Semantic Scholar
This novel method was demonstrated on the 38-DoF NASA Valkyrie humanoid by utilizing and exploiting whole body redundancy for accomplishing manipulation tasks on uneven terrains while avoiding obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
Random forests algorithms have been widely used in many classification and regression applications.	Semantic Scholar
However, the theory of random forests lags far behind their applications.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a novel random forests classification algorithm based on cooperative game theory.	Semantic Scholar
The Banzhaf power index is employed to evaluate the power of each feature by traversing possible feature coalitions.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, we call the proposed algorithm Banzhaf random forests (BRFs).	Semantic Scholar
Unlike the previously used information gain ratio, which only measures the power of each feature for classification and pays less attention to the intrinsic structure of the feature variables, the Banzhaf power index can measure the importance of each feature by computing the dependency among the group of features.	Semantic Scholar
More importantly, we have proved the consistency of BRFs, which narrows the gap between the theory and applications of random forests.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on several UCI benchmark data sets and three real world applications show that BRFs perform significantly better than existing consistent random forests on classification accuracy, and better than or at least comparable with Breiman's random forests, support vector machines (SVMs) and k-nearest neighbors (KNNs) classifiers.

In this paper we focus on gender classification from face images.	Semantic Scholar
Despite advances in equipment as well as methods, automatic face image processing for recognition or even just for the extraction of demographics, is still a challenging task in unrestricted scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
Our tests are aimed at carrying out an extensive comparison of a feature based approach with two score based ones.	Semantic Scholar
When directly using features, we first apply different operators to extract the corresponding feature vectors, and then stack such vectors.	Semantic Scholar
These are classified by a SVM-based approach.	Semantic Scholar
When using scores, the different operators are applied in a completely separate way, so that each of them produces the corresponding scores.	Semantic Scholar
Answers are then either fed to a SVM, or compared pairwise to exploit Likelihood Ratio.	Semantic Scholar
The testbeds used for experiments are EGA database, which presents a good balance with respect to demographic features of stored face images, and GROPUS, an increasingly popular benchmark for massive experiments.	Semantic Scholar
The obtained performances confirm that feature level fusion achieves an often better classification accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
However, it is computationally expensive.	Semantic Scholar
We contribute to the research on this topic in three ways: 1) we show that the proposed score level fusion approaches, though less demanding, can achieve results that are comparable to feature level fusion, or even slightly better given that we fuse a particular set of experts; the main advantage over the featurebased approach relying on chained vectors, is that it is not required to evaluate Preprint submitted to Computer Vision and Image Understanding September 9, 2016	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a new method to fully control complete 4-image-DoF manipulation of laparoscopic instruments [with remote center of motion (RCM) mechanism] based on the geometric features of a designed marker in a 2-D image.	Semantic Scholar
Our marker encodes the configuration of the instruments by computing geometric features among the projected image points from segmented areas in hue-saturation-value (HSV) space.	Semantic Scholar
We can then construct an image geometric feature vector to locally characterize the configuration of a laparoscopic instrument.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we design an image-based kinematic controller to asymptotically track a planned trajectory using the constructed feature vector as the feedback.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our integration of rotation distinguishing marker and kinematic controller by several experiments in terms of illumination-invariance, rotation angle accuracy, and controller performance.	Semantic Scholar
Sparse coding algorithms with continuous latent variables have been the subject of a large number of studies.	Semantic Scholar
However, discrete latent spaces for sparse coding have been largely ignored.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we study sparse coding with latents described by discrete instead of continuous prior distributions.	Semantic Scholar
We consider the general case in which the latents (while being sparse) can take on any value of a finite set of possible values and in which we learn the prior probability of any value from data.	Semantic Scholar
This approach can be applied to any data generated by discrete causes, and it can be applied as an approximation of continuous causes.	Semantic Scholar
As the prior probabilities are learned, the approach then allows for estimating the prior shape without assuming specific functional forms.	Semantic Scholar
To efficiently train the parameters of our probabilistic generative model, we apply a truncated expectation-maximization approach (expectation truncation) that we modify to work with a general discrete prior.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate the performance of the algorithm by applying it to a variety of tasks: (1) we use artificial data to verify that the algorithm can recover the generating parameters from a random initialization, (2) use image patches of natural images and discuss the role of the prior for the extraction of image components, (3) use extracellular recordings of neurons to present a novel method of analysis for spiking neurons that includes an intuitive discretization strategy, and (4) apply the algorithm on the task of encoding audio waveforms of human speech.

The diverse set of numerical experiments presented in this letter suggests that discrete sparse coding algorithms can scale efficiently to work with realistic data sets and provide novel statistical quantities to describe the structure of the data.	Semantic Scholar
This letter investigates the straight path following problem for a class of underactuated bioinspired snake robots on ground with unknown and varied friction coefficients.	Semantic Scholar
Existing works usually design control input requiring the exact values of these friction coefficients, which however rely on the specific operating terrain and may not always be known a priori.	Semantic Scholar
By virtue of backstepping technique, we present a novel adaptive controller that can perform the path following tasks and meanwhile it can compensate for unknown and varied friction coefficients in real time.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, it is proved via LaSalle–Yoshizawa theorem that the path following errors converge to zero asymptotically and all the parameter estimates are bounded.	Semantic Scholar
Simulations and experiments on an eight-link snake robot are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.	Semantic Scholar
Movement in echinoderms is facilitated by the coordinated activity of thousands of individually addressable and reversibly adhesive tube feet.	Semantic Scholar

Gait modes, such as level walking, stair ascent/descent, and ramp ascent/descent, show different lower-limb kinematic and kinetic characteristics.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, an accurate detection of these modes is critical for a wearable robot to provide appropriate power assistance.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a fast gait-mode-detection method based on a body sensor system is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
A fuzzy logic algorithm is used to estimate the likelihoods of gait modes in real time.	Semantic Scholar
Since the proposed fast gait mode detection makes it possible to select appropriate kinematic and kinetic models for each gait mode, assistive torques required for assisting the human motions can be obtained more naturally and immediately.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed methods are all verified by experiments with a lower-limb exoskeletal assistive robot with transparent actuation by series elastic actuators, called the exoskeletal robotic orthosis for walking assistance.	Semantic Scholar
Four healthy subjects participated in the experiments.	Semantic Scholar
All subjects were asked to perform different gait modes using their normal and simulated abnormal gaits, i.e., blocking the knee joint of one leg during walking.	Semantic Scholar
Latency and success rate of gait mode detection are selected as performance criteria.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness of the proposed gait-mode-based assistive strategy is evaluated using electromyography muscular activities.	Semantic Scholar
Heterogeneous networks are networks consisting of different types of objects and links.	Semantic Scholar
They can be found in several fields, ranging from the Internet to social sciences, biology, epidemiology, geography, finance, and many others.	Semantic Scholar
In the literature, several methods have been proposed for the analysis of network data, but they usually focus on homogeneous networks, where all the objects are of the same type, and links among them describe a single type of relationship.	Semantic Scholar
More recently, the complexity of real scenarios has impelled researchers to design methods for the analysis of heterogeneous networks, especially focused on classification and clustering tasks.	Semantic Scholar
However, they often make assumptions on the structure of the network that are too restrictive or do not fully exploit different forms of network correlation and autocorrelation.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, when nodes which are the main subject of the classification task are linked to several nodes of the network having missing values, standard methods can lead to either building incomplete classification models or to discarding possibly relevant dependencies (correlation or autocorrelation).

In this paper, we propose an ensemble learning approach for multi-type classification.	Semantic Scholar
We adopt the system Mr-SBC, which is originally able to analyze heterogeneous networks of arbitrary structure, within an ensemble learning approach.	Semantic Scholar
The ensemble allows us to improve the classification accuracy of Mr-SBC by exploiting i) the possible presence of correlation and autocorrelation phenomena, and ii) the classification of instances (which contain missing values) of other node types in the network.	Semantic Scholar
As a beneficial side effect, we have also that the models are more stable in terms of standard deviation of the accuracy, over different samples used for training.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments performed on real-world datasets show that the proposed method is able to significantly outperform the standard implementation of Mr-SBC.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, it gives Mr-SBC the advantage of outperforming four other well-known algorithms for the classification of data organized in a network.	Semantic Scholar

Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) holds as a classical method to build large scale machine learning models over big data.	Semantic Scholar
A stochastic gradient is typically calculated from a limited number of samples (known as mini-batch), which potentially incurs a high variance and causes the estimated parameters to bounce around the optimal solution.	Semantic Scholar
To improve the stability of stochastic gradient, recent years have witnessed the proposal of several semi-stochastic gradient descent algorithms, which distinguish themselves from standard SGD by incorporating global information into gradient computation.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we contribute a novel stratified semi-stochastic gradient descent (S3GD) algorithm to this nascent research area, accelerating the optimization of a large family of composite convex functions.	Semantic Scholar
Though theoretically converging faster, prior semi-stochastic algorithms are found to suffer from high iteration complexity, which makes them even slower than SGD in practice on many datasets.	Semantic Scholar
In our proposed S3GD, the semi-stochastic gradient is calculated based on efficient manifold propagation, which can be numerically accomplished by sparse matrix multiplications.	Semantic Scholar
This way S3GD is able to generate a highly-accurate estimate of the exact gradient from each mini-batch with largely-reduced computational complexity.	Semantic Scholar
Theoretic analysis reveals that the proposed S3GD elegantly balances the geometric algorithmic convergence rate against the space and time complexities during the optimization.	Semantic Scholar
The efficacy of S3GD is also experimentally corroborated on several large-scale benchmark datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Lisanne Bainbridge's 1983 paper, Ironies of Automation, has had considerable influence on human–machine research, prescience in predicting automation-related concerns that have led to incidents and accidents, and relevance to issues that are manifested to this day.	Semantic Scholar
Bainbridge's paper displays influences of several researchers, but Rasmussen's work on operator performance in process systems has perhaps been most influential.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike those who had earlier considered operator input a unidimensional aspect of system performance to be considered equally with other system elements, Rasmussen viewed operator performance as multidimensional—to be considered, with training and experience, in examining the operator role in system operations.	Semantic Scholar
Expanding on his work and applying it to automated systems, Bainbridge described how automation fundamentally altered the role of the human operator in system performance.	Semantic Scholar
Requiring the operator to oversee an automated system that could function more accurately and more reliably than he or she could, can affect system performance in the event that operator intervention is needed.	Semantic Scholar
The influence of the insights Bainbridge provided on the effects of automation on system performance could be seen in both research on automation and in the recognition of ironies discussed in subsequent automation-related accidents.	Semantic Scholar
Its inspiration to researchers, accident investigators, regulators, and managers continues to this day as automation development and its implementation continue unabated.	Semantic Scholar
Online approximation of the optimal station-keeping strategy for a marine craft subject to an irrotational current is considered.	Semantic Scholar
An approximate policy that minimizes a user-defined cost function over an infinite time horizon is obtained using an actor-critic-identifier-based adaptive dynamic programming technique.	Semantic Scholar
The hydrodynamic drift dynamics are assumed to be unknown; therefore, a concurrent learning-based system identifier is developed to identify the unknown model parameters.	Semantic Scholar
The identified model is used to implement an adaptive model-based reinforcement learning technique to estimate the unknown value function.	Semantic Scholar
The developed policy guarantees uniformly ultimately bounded convergence of the vehicle to the desired station and uniformly ultimately bounded convergence of the approximated policies to the optimal polices without the requirement of persistence of excitation.	Semantic Scholar
The developed strategy is validated using an autonomous underwater vehicle, where the three degrees-of-freedom in the horizontal plane are regulated.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments are conducted in a second-magnitude spring located in central Florida.	Semantic Scholar
Importance: A mystery illness striking U.S. and Canadian diplomats to Cuba (and now China) “has confounded the FBI, the State Department and US intelligence agencies” (Lederman, Weissenstein, & Lee, 2017).	Semantic Scholar
Sonic explanations for the so-called health attacks have long dominated media reports, propelled by peculiar sounds heard and auditory symptoms experienced.	Semantic Scholar
Sonic mediation was justly rejected by experts.	Semantic Scholar
We assessed whether pulsed radiofrequency/microwave radiation (RF/MW) exposure can accommodate reported facts in diplomats, including unusual ones.	Semantic Scholar
Observations: (1) Noises: Many diplomats heard chirping, ringing or grinding noises at night during episodes reportedly triggering health problems.	Semantic Scholar
Some reported that noises were localized with laser-like precision or said the sounds seemed to follow them (within the territory in which they were perceived).	Semantic Scholar
Pulsed RF/MW engenders just these apparent “sounds” via the Frey effect.	Semantic Scholar
Perceived “sounds” differ by head dimensions and pulse characteristics and can be perceived as located behind in or above the head.	Semantic Scholar
Ability to hear the “sounds” depends on high-frequency hearing and low ambient noise.	Semantic Scholar
(2) Signs/symptoms: Hearing loss and tinnitus are prominent in affected diplomats and in RF/MW-affected individuals.	Semantic Scholar
Each of the protean symptoms that diplomats report also affect persons reporting symptoms from RF/MW: sleep problems, headaches, and cognitive problems dominate in both groups.	Semantic Scholar
Sensations of pressure or vibration figure in each.	Semantic Scholar
Both encompass vision, balance, and speech problems and nosebleeds.	Semantic Scholar
Brain injury and brain swelling are reported in both.	Semantic Scholar
(3) Mechanisms: Oxidative stress provides a documented mechanism of RF/MW injury compatible with reported signs and symptoms; sequelae of endothelial dysfunction (yielding blood flow compromise), membrane damage, blood-brain barrier disruption, mitochondrial injury, apoptosis, and autoimmune triggering afford downstream mechanisms, of varying persistence, that merit investigation.	Semantic Scholar
(4) Of note, microwaving of the U.S. embassy in Moscow is historically documented.	Semantic Scholar
Conclusions and relevance: Reported facts appear consistent with pulsed RF/MW as the source of injury in affected diplomats.	Semantic Scholar
Nondiplomats citing symptoms from RF/MW, often with an inciting pulsed-RF/MW exposure, report compatible health conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Under the RF/MW hypothesis, lessons learned for diplomats and for RF/MW-affected civilians may each aid the other.	Semantic Scholar
Rule extraction from black box models is critical in domains that require model validation before implementation, as can be the case in credit scoring and medical diagnosis.	Semantic Scholar
Though already a challenging problem in statistical learning in general, the difficulty is even greater when highly nonlinear, recursive models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are fit to data.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we study the extraction of rules from second-order RNNs trained to recognize the Tomita grammars.	Semantic Scholar
We show that production rules can be stably extracted from trained RNNs and that in certain cases, the rules outperform the trained RNNs.	Semantic Scholar
System verification is often hindered by the absence of formal models.	Semantic Scholar
Peled et al.	Semantic Scholar
proposed black-box checking as a solution to this problem.	Semantic Scholar
This technique applies active automata learning to infer models of systems with unknown internal structure.	Semantic Scholar
This kind of learning relies on conformance testing to determine whether a learned model actually represents the considered system.	Semantic Scholar
Since conformance testing may require the execution of a large number of tests, it is considered the main bottleneck in automata learning.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we describe a randomised conformance testing approach which we extend with fault-based test selection.	Semantic Scholar
To show its effectiveness we apply the approach in learning experiments and compare its performance to a well-established testing technique, the partial W-method.	Semantic Scholar
This evaluation demonstrates that our approach significantly reduces the cost of learning.	Semantic Scholar
In multiple experiments, we reduce the cost by at least one order of magnitude.	Semantic Scholar
Generating optimal trajectories for a large numbers of vehicles in real-time becomes extremely challenging when including realistic dynamic models and time-varying obstacle constraints.	Semantic Scholar
We present a novel method to efficiently produce time-optimal collision-free trajectories in complex non-convex maze-like environments while enforcing nonlinear constraints on velocity, acceleration, jerk, and snap.	Semantic Scholar
The approach combines two complementary numerical techniques for optimal control: level set reachability analysis and pseudospectral orthogonal collocation.	Semantic Scholar
Applied in a multi-agent prioritized planning framework, the methodology allows for heterogeneous sizes, dynamics, endpoint conditions, and individualized optimization objectives, while achieving linear scaling in computation time relative to the number of vehicles.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation examples are shown with up to 26 static obstacles and 32 quadcopters in a tightly constrained space with average computation times of 1–3.5 s per vehicle, depending on scenario complexity.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we answer two interleaved questions.	Semantic Scholar
The first one is, having a redundant serial manipulator with a given cyclic task, how can we benefit simultaneously from both natural dynamics modification (NDM) and kinematic redundancy resolution to reduce the actuators’ torque?	Semantic Scholar
Here, the NDM is done by devising parallel nonlinear monoarticular compliances (MACs), which span one joint, and nonlinear biarticular compliances (BACs), which pass over two joints.	Semantic Scholar
We take advantage of kinematic redundancy to exploit the robot's natural dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
The second question is how do kinematic redundancy resolution and the NDM interact to minimize the cost?	Semantic Scholar
To answer these questions, we cast the problem of simultaneous modification and exploitation of natural dynamics into a constrained multiobjective optimization problem.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the set of optimal compliances has an analytical solution as a parametric function of joint trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
Accordingly, we study how the components of cost function affect the profile of optimal compliant elements.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method is implemented on a simulated planar 3-DoF manipulator and a simulated nonplanar 4-DoF manipulator for three different tasks.	Semantic Scholar
The results shed light on how kinematic redundancy resolution influences efficiency of using MACs and BACs and, consequently, increases attainable gains from the NDM.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, analysis of the results specifies the roles of mono- and BACs and especially explains the reason behind the particular importance of having BACs to reduce the actuation cost.	Semantic Scholar
Video-based face, expression, and scene recognition are fundamental problems in human–machine interaction, especially when there is a short-length video.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a new derivative sparse representation approach for face and texture recognition using short-length videos.	Semantic Scholar
First, it builds local linear subspaces of dynamic texture segments by computing spatiotemporal directional derivatives in a cylinder neighborhood within dynamic textures.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike traditional methods, a nonbinary texture coding technique is proposed to extract high-order derivatives using continuous circular and cylinder regions to avoid aliasing effects.	Semantic Scholar
Then, these local linear subspaces of texture segments are mapped onto a Grassmann manifold via sparse representation.	Semantic Scholar
A new joint sparse representation algorithm is developed to establish the correspondences of subspace points on the manifold for measuring the similarity between two dynamic textures.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on the Honda/UCSD, the CMU motion of body, the YouTube, and the DynTex datasets show that the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in dynamic texture recognition, and achieved the encouraging highest accuracy reported to date on the challenging YouTube face dataset.

The encouraging experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in video-based face recognition in human–machine system applications.	Semantic Scholar

This letter presents a system for manipulating microscale objects in an obstacle prone environment using push manipulations based on a learned model.	Semantic Scholar
The path planning is done using a RRT* search algorithm adapted for this setup and the manipulation is done using a regression model trained on manipulation data collected a priori .	Semantic Scholar
This model is used to capture the dynamics of the micropart and its interaction with the environment such as frictional contacts and other uncertainties that are difficult to model explicitly.	Semantic Scholar
The push manipulation is done using probes attached to micromanipulators capable of high-resolution movements.	Semantic Scholar
The setup is demonstrated through simulations using two manipulators and a LEGO inspired micropart as it is pushed through different trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments include performing push manipulations in the presence of obstacles, with single and multiple manipulators, and demonstrating the use of the system to perform a microassembly task.	Semantic Scholar
The major contribution is a working manipulation system for microparts that implicitly models difficult to model aspects like uncertainties in the environment, such as physical phenomena in the microscale like friction, and the contact interactions between microparts.	Semantic Scholar
Reliable propagation of information through large networks, e.g., communication networks, social networks, or sensor networks is very important in many applications concerning marketing, social networks, and wireless sensor networks.	Semantic Scholar
However, social ties of friendship may be obsolete, and communication links may fail, inducing the notion of uncertainty in such networks.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we address the problem of optimizing information propagation in uncertain networks given a constrained budget of edges.	Semantic Scholar
We show that this problem requires to solve two NP-hard subproblems: the computation of expected information flow, and the optimal choice of edges.	Semantic Scholar
To compute the expected information flow to a source vertex, we propose the F-tree as a specialized data structure, that identifies independent components of the graph for which the information flow can either be computed analytically and efficiently, or for which traditional Monte-Carlo sampling can be applied independently of the remaining network.	Semantic Scholar
For the problem of finding the optimal edges, we propose a series of heuristics that exploit properties of this data structure.	Semantic Scholar
Our evaluation shows that these heuristics lead to high quality solutions, thus yielding high information flow, while maintaining low running time.	Semantic Scholar
Farmers are under growing pressure to intensify production to feed a growing population while managing environmental impact.	Semantic Scholar
Robotics has the potential to address these challenges by replacing large complex farm machinery with fleets of small autonomous robots.	Semantic Scholar
This article presents our research toward the goal of developing teams of autonomous robots that perform typical farm coverage operations.	Semantic Scholar
Making a large fleet of autonomous robots economical requires the use of inexpensive sensors, such as cameras for localization and obstacle avoidance.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we describe a vision-based obstacle detection system that continually adapts to environmental and illumination variations and a visionassisted localization system that can guide a robot along crop rows with a complex appearance.	Semantic Scholar
Large fleets of robots will become time-consuming to monitor, control, and resupply.	Semantic Scholar
To reduce this burden, we describe a vision-based docking system for autonomously refilling liquid supplies and an interface for controlling multiple robots.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose an algorithm for the training of neural network control policies for quadrotors.	Semantic Scholar
The learned control policy computes control commands directly from sensor inputs and is, hence, computationally efficient.	Semantic Scholar
An imitation learning algorithm produces a policy that reproduces the behavior of a supervisor.	Semantic Scholar
The supervisor provides demonstrations of path following and collision avoidance maneuvers.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the generalization ability of neural networks, the resulting policy performs local collision avoidance, while following a global reference path.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm uses a time-free model-predictive path-following controller as a supervisor.	Semantic Scholar
The controller generates demonstrations by following few example paths.	Semantic Scholar
This enables an easy-to-implement learning algorithm that is robust to errors of the model used in the model-predictive controller.	Semantic Scholar
The policy is trained on the real quadrotor, which requires collision-free exploration around the example path.	Semantic Scholar
An adapted version of the supervisor is used to enable exploration.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, the policy can be trained from a relatively small number of examples on the real quadrotor, making the training sample efficient.	Semantic Scholar
In manual control tasks, preview of the target trajectory ahead is often limited by poor lighting, objects, or display edges.	Semantic Scholar
This paper investigates the effects of limited preview, or preview time, in manual tracking tasks with single- and double-integrator controlled element dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
A quasi-linear human controller model is used to predict the human behavior adaptations offline, by finding the model parameters that yield optimal performance at each preview time.	Semantic Scholar
These predictions are then verified by fitting the same model to measurements from a human-in-the-loop experiment, where subjects performed a tracking task with eight different preview time settings between 0 and 2 s. Results show that the tracking performance improves and the model's “look-ahead” time parameters increase with increasing preview time.	Semantic Scholar
Beyond a certain preview time, approximately 0.6 s and 1.15 s in single- and double-integrator tasks, respectively, additional preview evokes no further adaptations.	Semantic Scholar
The offline model predictions closely match the experimental results, which thereby promises to facilitate similar quantitative insights in other tasks with restricted preview.	Semantic Scholar
We study numerically the memory that forgets, introduced in 1986 by Parisi by bounding the synaptic strength, with a mechanism that avoids confusion; allows remembering the pattern learned more recently; and has a physiologically very well-defined meaning.	Semantic Scholar
We analyze a number of features of this learning for a finite number of neurons and finite number of patterns.	Semantic Scholar
We discuss how the system behaves in the large but finite N limit.	Semantic Scholar
We analyze the basin of attraction of the patterns that have been learned, and we show that it is exponentially small in the age of the pattern.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the decentralized nature of the Semantic Web, the same real-world entity may be described in various data sources with different ontologies and assigned syntactically distinct identifiers.	Semantic Scholar
In order to facilitate data utilization and consumption in the Semantic Web, without compromising the freedom of people to publish their data, one critical problem is to appropriately interlink such heterogeneous data.	Semantic Scholar
This interlinking process is sometimes referred to as Entity Matching, i.e., finding which identifiers refer to the same real-world entity.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose two candidate selection algorithms to improve the scalability of entity matching systems.	Semantic Scholar
First of all, we propose HistSim that utilizes the matching histories of the instances to prune instance pairs that are not sufficiently similar to the same pool of other instances.	Semantic Scholar
A sigmoid function based thresholding method is proposed to automatically adjust the threshold for such commonality on-the-fly.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we propose DisNGram that selects candidate instance pairs by computing a character-level similarity metric on discriminating literal values that are chosen using domain-independent unsupervised learning.	Semantic Scholar
Instances are indexed on the chosen predicates' literal values to enable efficient look-up for similar instances.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, in order to be able to handle heterogeneous datasets with a large number of predicates, a mechanism for automatically determining predicate comparability is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our two candidate selection algorithms against six state-of-the-art systems on three Semantic Web datasets, and demonstrate that our proposed algorithms frequently outperform state-of-the-art systems on F1-score and runtime.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a novel cooperative navigation control for human–robot teams.	Semantic Scholar
Assuming that a human wants to reach a final location in a large environment with the help of a mobile robot, the robot must steer the human from the initial to the target position.	Semantic Scholar
The challenges posed by cooperative human–robot navigation are typically addressed by using haptic feedback via physical interaction.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast with that, in this paper, we describe a different approach, in which the human–robot interaction is achieved via wearable vibrotactile armbands.	Semantic Scholar
In the proposed work, the subject is free to decide her/his own pace.	Semantic Scholar
A warning vibrational signal is generated by the haptic armbands when a large deviation with respect to the desired pose is detected by the robot.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method has been evaluated in a large indoor environment, where 15 blindfolded human subjects were asked to follow the haptic cues provided by the robot.	Semantic Scholar
The participants had to reach a target area, while avoiding static and dynamic obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results revealed that the blindfolded subjects were able to avoid the obstacles and safely reach the target in all of the performed trials.	Semantic Scholar
A comparison is provided between the results obtained with blindfolded users and experiments performed with sighted people.	Semantic Scholar
State of the art Bayesian classification approaches typically maintain a posterior distribution over possible classes given available sensor observations (images).	Semantic Scholar
Yet, while these approaches fuse all classifier outputs thus far, they do not provide any indication regarding how reliable the posterior classification is, thus limiting its functionality in terms of autonomous systems and robotics.	Semantic Scholar
On the other hand, current deep learning based classifiers provide an uncertainty measure, thereby quantifying model uncertainty.	Semantic Scholar
However, they do so on a single frame basis and do not consider a sequential framework.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we develop a novel approach that infers a distribution over posterior class probabilities, while accounting for model uncertainty.	Semantic Scholar
This distribution enables reasoning about uncertainty in the posterior classification and, therefore, is of prime importance for robust classification, object-level perception in uncertain and ambiguous scenarios, and for safe autonomy in general.	Semantic Scholar
The distribution of the posterior class probability has no known analytical solution; thus, we propose to approximate this distribution via sampling.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our approach in simulation and using real images fed into a convolutional neural network classifier.	Semantic Scholar

Such genealogical datasets provide a great opportunity for social science analysts, historians, and the public to study a wide variety of topics in demography, family and household, kinship, stratification, and health.	Semantic Scholar
Nevertheless, the large scale and characteristics of the data such as hierarchical, spatiotemporal, and multidimensional also pose special challenges for effective data analysis.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we introduce GenealogyVis, a visual analytic system to analyze family history and evolution by using the China Multigenerational Panel Dataset-Liaoning, which has more than 1.5 million observations and provides socioeconomic, demographic, and other information for more than 260 000 residents, and further enable users to explore the correlation between the development of families and the social context of environments, economics, policies, and so on.

Haptic feedback is a critical but a clinically missing component in robotic minimally invasive surgeries.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a Gaussian process regression (GPR) based scheme to address the gripping force estimation problem for clinically commonly used elongated cable-driven surgical instruments.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the cable-driven mechanism property studies, and surgical robotic system properties, four different GPR filters were designed and analyzed, including one GPR filter with two-dimensional inputs, one GPR filter with three-dimensional inputs, one GPR unscented Kalman filter (UKF) with two-dimensional inputs, and one GPR UKF with three-dimensional inputs.

A widely used technique is 3D non-rigid registration to estimate the transformation between two instances of a deforming structure.	Semantic Scholar
Despite many previous developments on this topic, it remains a challenging problem.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we propose a novel approach to non-rigid registration combining two data spaces in order to robustly calculate the correspondences and transformation between two data sets.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we use point color as well as 3D location as these are the common outputs of RGB-D cameras.	Semantic Scholar
We have propose the Color Coherent Point Drift (CCPD) algorithm (an extension of the CPD method [1]).	Semantic Scholar
Evaluation is performed using synthetic and real data.	Semantic Scholar
The synthetic data includes easy shapes that allow evaluation of the effect of noise, outliers and missing data.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, an evaluation of realistic figures obtained using Blensor is carried out.	Semantic Scholar
Real data acquired using a general purpose Primesense Carmine sensor is used to validate the CCPD for real shapes.	Semantic Scholar
For all tests, the proposed method is compared to the original CPD showing better results in registration accuracy in most cases.	Semantic Scholar
Man-made environments tend to be abundant with planar homogeneous texture, which manifests as regularly repeating scene elements along a plane.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we propose to exploit such structure to facilitate high-level scene understanding.	Semantic Scholar
By robustly fitting a texture projection model to optimal dominant frequency estimates in image patches, we arrive at a projective-invariant method to localize such generic, semantically meaningful regions in multi-planar scenes.	Semantic Scholar
The recovered projective parameters also allow an affine-ambiguous rectification in real-world images marred with outliers, room clutter, and photometric severities.	Semantic Scholar
Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations are performed that show our method outperforms existing representative work for both rectification and detection.	Semantic Scholar
The potential of homogeneous texture for two scene understanding tasks is then explored.	Semantic Scholar
Firstly, in environments where vanishing points cannot be reliably detected, or the Manhattan assumption is not satisfied, homogeneous texture detected by the proposed approach is shown to provide alternative cues to obtain a scene geometric layout.	Semantic Scholar
Second, low-level feature descriptors extracted upon affine rectification of detected texture are found to be not only class-discriminative but also complementary to features without rectification, improving recognition performance on the 67-category MIT benchmark of indoor scenes.	Semantic Scholar
One of our configurations involving deep ConvNet features outperforms most current state-of-the-art work on this dataset, achieving a classification accuracy of 76.90%.	Semantic Scholar
The approach is additionally validated on a set of 31 categories (mostly outdoor man-made environments exhibiting regular, repeating structure), being a subset of the large-scale Places2 scene dataset.	Semantic Scholar
The statistical dependencies that independent component analysis (ICA) cannot remove often provide rich information beyond the linear independent components.	Semantic Scholar
It would thus be very useful to estimate the dependency structure from data.	Semantic Scholar
While such models have been proposed, they have usually concentrated on higher-order correlations such as energy (square) correlations.	Semantic Scholar
Yet linear correlations are a fundamental and informative form of dependency in many real data sets.	Semantic Scholar
Linear correlations are usually completely removed by ICA and related methods so they can only be analyzed by developing new methods that explicitly allow for linearly correlated components.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we propose a probabilistic model of linear nongaussian components that are allowed to have both linear and energy correlations.	Semantic Scholar
The precision matrix of the linear components is assumed to be randomly generated by a higher-order process and explicitly parameterized by a parameter matrix.	Semantic Scholar
The estimation of the parameter matrix is shown to be particularly simple because using score-matching (Hyvärinen, 2005), the objective function is a quadratic form.	Semantic Scholar
Using simulations with artificial data, we demonstrate that the proposed method improves the identifiability of nongaussian components by simultaneously learning their correlation structure.	Semantic Scholar
Applications on simulated complex cells with natural image input, as well as spectrograms of natural audio data, show that the method finds new kinds of dependencies between the components.	Semantic Scholar

This study deals with dynamic object manipulation by a robot using a tool.	Semantic Scholar
In order to keep the contact between the held spatula and the manipulated object, a variety of movements satisfying conditions in acceleration dimension should be planned.	Semantic Scholar
However, it is quite difficult to assure the acceleration to stay in a certain range in case disturbances exist.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, this study proposes a control architecture for acceleration control and discusses how to develop a controller suitable for dynamic object manipulation.	Semantic Scholar

Soft robots are able to complete tasks that traditional robots cannot, thus providing new opportunities for robots to navigate confined spaces.	Semantic Scholar
These tasks include pipe inspection and endoluminal surgical applications.	Semantic Scholar
The research objective of this letter is to present a design methodology for soft robots capable of traversing a cannula or pipe using only passive elements, a single pressure source, and while avoiding blockage, that is, avoiding full occlusion of the cannula to still allow fluid flow.	Semantic Scholar
The robot consists of three segments, each with actuators and valves, and is driven by hydraulics (water).	Semantic Scholar
The actuators were built using the FREE method and optimized for the specific task of traversing a cannula with a diameter of 19 mm.	Semantic Scholar
An experimental approach was used to create a pressure–volume relationship from the kinematic fiber-reinforced elastomer enclosure (FREE) model.	Semantic Scholar
The passive valves were built as flow restrictors and modeled with the nonlinear orifice equation.	Semantic Scholar
A simulation and grid search was performed over a range of valve coefficients.	Semantic Scholar
An objective function was then maximized to produce orifice coefficients that augmented extension of the robot per input pressure cycle.	Semantic Scholar
The physical robot was then constructed and tested in a cannula.	Semantic Scholar
This resulted in a robot that was serially actuated, never fully occluded the cannula, and was able to successfully locomote a cannula at a rate of $27\pm 4$ mm per two-second cycle.	Semantic Scholar
This experimental result was close to the simulated result of $28$mm per cycle.	Semantic Scholar
Plasticity is one of the most important properties of the nervous system, which enables animals to adjust their behavior to the ever-changing external environment.	Semantic Scholar
Changes in synaptic efficacy between neurons constitute one of the major mechanisms of plasticity.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, estimation of neural connections is crucial for investigating information processing in the brain.	Semantic Scholar
Although many analysis methods have been proposed for this purpose, most of them suffer from one or all the following mathematical difficulties: (1) only partially observed neural activity is available; (2) correlations can include both direct and indirect pseudo-interactions; and (3) biological evidence that a neuron typically has only one type of connection (excitatory or inhibitory) should be considered.	Semantic Scholar
To overcome these difficulties, a novel probabilistic framework for estimating neural connections from partially observed spikes is proposed in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
First, based on the property of a sum of random variables, the proposed method estimates the influence of unobserved neurons on observed neurons and extracts only the correlations among observed neurons.	Semantic Scholar
Second, the relationship between pseudo-correlations and target connections is modeled by neural propagation in a multiplicative manner.	Semantic Scholar
Third, a novel information-theoretic framework is proposed for estimating neuron types.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method was validated using spike data generated by artificial neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, it was applied to multi-unit data recorded from the CA1 area of a rat's hippocampus.	Semantic Scholar
The results confirmed that our estimates are consistent with previous reports.	Semantic Scholar
These findings indicate that the proposed method is useful for extracting crucial interactions in neural signals as well as in other multi-probed point process data.	Semantic Scholar
In daily life, most hand movements involve the simultaneous activation of multiple fingers.	Semantic Scholar
Models generated by semiunsupervised learning in which only individual finger activation data are used in training have recently been suggested for simultaneous and proportional control of prosthetic robot hands.	Semantic Scholar
Although training with many datasets should be avoided, simultaneous activation data need to be used, for example, when the model estimation of the simultaneous activation is very poor or highly coupled among the degrees-of-freedoms (DOFs).	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a method for generating a model using any type of activation data (individual, simultaneous, or both) by modifying the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with the Hadamard product (HP).	Semantic Scholar
The model provided by this method is called NMF-HP.	Semantic Scholar
NMF-HP has two advantages: First, it can use simultaneous activation data for training.	Semantic Scholar
Second, NMF-HP decouples coupled DOFs by forcing nonactive DOFs to be zero during the training phase.	Semantic Scholar
NMF-HP was tested in two cases (trained with only individual activation data and trained with both individual and simultaneous activation data) in offline and online experiments.	Semantic Scholar
In the offline test, NMF-HP outperformed the conventional semiunsupervised models for the simultaneous activation of the fingers.	Semantic Scholar
In the online test, NMF-HP was significantly better than NMF in the estimation of finger-motion intentions.	Semantic Scholar
This result contrasts with that of a previous study in which performance in the online test revealed a little difference between the models, possibly due to the human-embedded control.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, the result of this paper indicates that using simultaneous activation data and reducing the coupling among DOFs may be effective in enhancing the performance of the real-time control of a prosthetic robot hand.	Semantic Scholar
Effective handling of delicate objects remains a challenging problem in manufacturing.	Semantic Scholar
Instead of using a specialized gripper or control scheme, we present a solution involving gecko-inspired directional adhesives affixed to an industrial robot gripper and tactile sensor.	Semantic Scholar
The adhesives sustain large shear forces with very low pressure.	Semantic Scholar
They also release objects without residual adhesion when the grip is relaxed.	Semantic Scholar
It is desirable to predict the maximum forces and moments the gripper can exert without slipping.	Semantic Scholar
For this purpose the tactile sensor provides an estimate of the area of contact, and a force/torque sensor measures the overall force and moment.	Semantic Scholar
To resist forces and moments in multiple directions, it is best if the directional adhesives do not all have a single orientation.	Semantic Scholar
A chevron pattern strikes a good balance between performance and ease of fabrication.	Semantic Scholar
Sound source localization (SSL) in a robotic platform has been essential in the overall scheme of robot audition.	Semantic Scholar
It allows a robot to locate a sound source by sound alone.	Semantic Scholar
It has an important impact on other robot audition modules, such as source separation, and it enriches human–robot interaction by complementing the robot’s perceptual capabilities.	Semantic Scholar
The main objective of this review is to thoroughly map the current state of the SSL field for the reader and provide a starting point to SSL in robotics.	Semantic Scholar
To this effect, we present: the evolution and historical context of SSL in robotics; an extensive review and classification of SSL techniques and popular tracking methodologies; different facets of SSL as well as its state-of-the-art; evaluationmethodologies used for SSL; and a set of challenges and researchmotivations.

Video object codiscovery can leverage the weak semantic constraint implied by sentences that describe the video content.	Semantic Scholar
Our codiscovery method, like other object codetection techniques, does not employ any pretrained object models or detectors.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike most prior work that focuses on codetecting large objects which are usually salient both in size and appearance, our method can discover small or medium sized objects as well as ones that may be occluded for part of the video.	Semantic Scholar
More importantly, our method can codiscover multiple object instances of different classes within a single video clip.	Semantic Scholar
Although the semantic information employed is usually simple and weak, it can greatly boost performance by constraining the hypothesized object locations.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments show promising results on three datasets: an average IoU score of 0.423 on a new dataset with 15 object classes, an average IoU score of 0.373 on a subset of CAD-120 with 5 object classes, and an average IoU score of 0.358 on a subset of MPII-Cooking with 7 object classes.	Semantic Scholar
Our result on this subset of MPII-Cooking improves upon those of the previous state-of-the-art methods by significant margins.	Semantic Scholar
New entities are being created daily.	Semantic Scholar
Though the novelty of these entities naturally attracts mentions, due to lack of prior knowledge, it is more challenging to collect knowledge about such entities than pre-existing entities, whose KBs are comprehensively annotated through LBSNs and EBSNs.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we focus on knowledge harvesting for emerging spatial entities (ESEs), such as new businesses and venues, assuming we have only a list of ESE names.	Semantic Scholar
Existing techniques for knowledge base (KB) harvesting are primarily associated with information extraction from textual corpora.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast, we propose a multimodal method for event detection based on the complementary interaction of image, text, and user information between multi-source platforms, namely Flickr and Twitter.	Semantic Scholar
We empirically validate our harvesting approaches improve the quality of KB with enriched place and event knowledge.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a trajectory planner for humanoid robots based on nonlinear model predictive control that can generate trajectories with variable center of mass (COM) heights and adaptive foot positions in real-time.	Semantic Scholar
This is done by analytically formulating the zero moment point constraint as a quadratic function that includes the vertical COM state.	Semantic Scholar
This constraint is then combined with linear foot position constraints, constraints on the vertical COM state and a quadratic goal function to form a quadratically constrained quadratic program.	Semantic Scholar
This program is then solved via sequential quadratic programing.	Semantic Scholar
It can be solved in less than 5 ms on average with a 3.4 GHz CPU by taking advantage of the fact that the analytic problem formulation allows the analytical gradients to be computed, thus time consuming numerical differentiation is avoided and the gradient computation time is reduced from 12.4  to 0.12 ms. An experiment on a 3.5 Kg robot is conducted to verify the effectiveness of this algorithm in walking on a terrain where the two feet are at different heights.	Semantic Scholar
Lastly it is shown via simulation that the proposed approach can improve disturbance recovery capacity by up to 7%.	Semantic Scholar
The objective of this work was to develop and validate a novel unobtrusive method for measuring person's physiological response with a low-cost integrated sensory system for use in a physical control task.	Semantic Scholar
Two different sensory handles were designed (cylindrical and hemispherical shape) and used in a physical human–robot control task.	Semantic Scholar
Twenty-three participants underwent a measurement session with both handles, performing four different tasks for each handle.	Semantic Scholar
Two basic task conditions were permuted: physical load (high/low) and task dynamics (high/low).	Semantic Scholar
Electrocardiogram, photoplethysmogram, electrodermal activity, and peripheral skin temperature signals were recorded by sensory handles and a reference high-accuracy biosignal amplifier to determine the raw signal correlation between the measurement systems.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, several standardized physiological parameters were calculated and discussed for both systems.	Semantic Scholar
Results of raw signal correlation showed a high correlation between the reference measurement system and the sensory handles.	Semantic Scholar
Pearson's correlation coefficients were above 0.8 for most of the physiological signals in all task conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Some effect of physical load and high task dynamics was registered.	Semantic Scholar
In terms of signal quality, the hemispherical design outperformed the cylindrical design.	Semantic Scholar
Correlation results show that the proposed system correlates well with the reference system for all tasks.	Semantic Scholar
In terms of optimal design for signal quality and comfort, hemispherical handle shape is more appropriate.	Semantic Scholar
Unobtrusive nature and short setup time of such a method deems it appropriate for home use, monitoring, and research.	Semantic Scholar
The compliant structure of soft robotic systems enables a variety of novel capabilities in comparison to traditional rigid-bodied robots.	Semantic Scholar
A subclass of soft fluid-driven actuators known as fiber-reinforced elastomeric enclosures (FREEs) is particularly well suited as actuators for these types of systems.	Semantic Scholar
FREEs are inherently soft and can impart spatial forces without imposing a rigid structure.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, they can be configured to produce a large variety of force and moment combinations.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we explore the potential of combining multiple differently configured FREEs in parallel to achieve fully controllable multidimensional soft actuation.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we propose a novel methodology to represent and calculate the generalized forces generated by soft actuators as a function of their internal pressure.	Semantic Scholar
This methodology relies on the notion of a state dependent fluid Jacobian that yields a linear expression for force.	Semantic Scholar
We employ this concept to construct the set of all possible forces that can be generated by a soft system in a given state.	Semantic Scholar
This force zonotope can be used to inform the design and control of parallel combinations of soft actuators.	Semantic Scholar
The approach is verified experimentally with the parallel combination of three carefully designed actuators constrained to a 2DOF test platform.	Semantic Scholar
The force predictions matched measured values with a root-mean-square error of less than 1.5 N force and  $\mathbf {8 \times 10^{-3}}$ Nm moment, demonstrating the utility of the presented methodology.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we investigate the online generation of optimal trajectories for target tracking with a quadrotor while satisfying a set of image-based and actuation constraints.	Semantic Scholar
We consider a quadrotor equipped with a camera (either down or front-looking) with limited field of view.	Semantic Scholar
The aim is to follow in a smooth but reactive way a moving target while avoiding obstacles in the environment and occlusions in the image space.	Semantic Scholar
We propose vision-based approaches based on multiobjective optimization, especially with the occlusion constraint formulation.	Semantic Scholar
We design an online replanning strategy inspired from model predictive control that successively solves a nonlinear optimization problem.	Semantic Scholar
The problem is formulated as a nonlinear program (NLP) using differential flatness and finite parametrization with B-Splines.	Semantic Scholar
This allows a resolution by sequential quadratic programming (SQP) at a rate of 30 Hz.	Semantic Scholar
The robustness and reactivity of the replanning algorithm are demonstrated through realistic simulation results.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments validating the performance with a real quadrotor are also presented.	Semantic Scholar
In many realistic networks, the edges representing the interactions between nodes are time varying.	Semantic Scholar
Evidence is growing that the complex network that models the dynamics of the human brain has time-varying interconnections, that is, the network is evolving.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this evidence, we construct a patient- and data-specific evolving network model (comprising discrete-time dynamical systems) in which epileptic seizures or their terminations in the brain are also determined by the nature of the time-varying interconnections between the nodes.	Semantic Scholar
A novel and unique feature of our methodology is that the evolving network model remembers the data from which it was conceived from, in the sense that it evolves to almost regenerate the patient data even on presenting an arbitrary initial condition to it.	Semantic Scholar
We illustrate a potential utility of our methodology by constructing an evolving network from clinical data that aids in identifying an approximate seizure focus; nodes in such a theoretically determined seizure focus are outgoing hubs that apparently act as spreaders of seizures.	Semantic Scholar
We also point out the efficacy of removal of such spreaders in limiting seizures.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, using the active dual-mode twisted string actuation (TSA) mechanism and tiny tension sensors on the tendon strings, an anthropomorphic robot hand is newly designed in a compact manner.	Semantic Scholar
Thanks to the active dual-mode TSA mechanism, which is a miniaturized transmission, the proposed robot hand dose has a wide range of operation in terms of the grasping force and speed.	Semantic Scholar
It experimentally produces maximally the fingertip force 31.3 N and minimally the closing time of 0.5 s in average.	Semantic Scholar
Also, tiny tension sensor with the dimension of 4.7 (width) × 4.0 (height) × 10.75 (length) mm is newly presented and embedded at the fingertips in order to measure the tension on the tendon strings, which would allow the grasping force control.	Semantic Scholar
The kinetic and kinematic analyses are performed and the performance is verified by experiments.	Semantic Scholar

Many scenarios require access to locations that are difficult to reach; however, mobile and untethered robots for these applications operate on a limited reserve of energy.	Semantic Scholar
Researchers often design robots specifically to be able to wait for periods of time in low-power states, conserving energy, and protecting hardware during periods of inactivity.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we introduce a temporary anchor using a low-power hybrid electrostatic/gecko-inspired adhesive for robots such as quadrotors and wall-climbing systems to allow access to remote areas while providing the ability to safely hold a position for an extended duration.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a self-contained electrostatic and gecko-inspired adhesive anchor mechanism, which is particularly well suited for long-duration payload placement.	Semantic Scholar
With structural layers comprised of a rigid plate and a soft foam, this anchor distributes normal stress across the pad while maintaining the compliance required for effective use of the adhesives.	Semantic Scholar
This new approach to loading the hybrid adhesive increases the distance off-the-wall that a payload can be supported, even on rough surfaces.	Semantic Scholar
We model the capacity of the device and demonstrate carrying an 11.9 N load applied 12 mm off of a rough drywall surface with an adhesive area of 32 cm$^{-2}$.	Semantic Scholar
We also offer two innovations that extend the mission-duration of an electrostatic adhesive anchor.	Semantic Scholar
We show that polyimide, a common dielectric layer in flex circuits, is prone to failing over a period of hours while both polyethylene-terephthalate and polyethylene-napthalate films demonstrate long-term stability under the applied electrical field.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, to reduce the power consumption of the adhesive, we introduce the concept of power-cycling, and reduce power consumption by an order of magnitude while still maintaining over 85 percent adhesion strength.This temporary anchor can be scaled in size to suit a given application, with virtually no difference in power draw or required electronics.We model the payload capacity of the anchor, and demonstrate performance on a variety of surfaces.

At the core of graph mining lies independent expansion of substructures where a substructure (also referred to as a subgraph) independently grows into a number of larger substructures in each iteration.	Semantic Scholar
Such an independent expansion, invariably, leads to the generation of duplicates.	Semantic Scholar
In the presence of graph partitions, duplicates are generated both within and across partitions.	Semantic Scholar
Eliminating these duplicates (for correctness) not only incurs generation and storage cost but also additional computation for its elimination.	Semantic Scholar
Our primary aim is to design techniques to reduce generating duplicate substructures as we show that they cannot be eliminated.	Semantic Scholar
This paper introduces three constraint-based optimization techniques, each significantly improving the overall mining cost by reducing the number of duplicates generated.	Semantic Scholar
These alternatives provide flexibility to choose the right technique based on graph properties.	Semantic Scholar
We establish theoretical correctness of each technique as well as its analysis with respect to graph characteristics such as degree, number of unique labels, and label distribution.	Semantic Scholar
We also investigate the applicability of their combination for improvements in duplicate reduction.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we discuss the effects of the constraints with respect to the partitioning schemes used in graph mining.	Semantic Scholar
Our experiments demonstrate significant benefits of these constraints in terms of storage, computation, and communication cost (specific to partitioned approaches) across graphs with varied characteristics.	Semantic Scholar
The techniques of random matrices have played an important role in many machine learning models.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a new method to study the tail inequalities for sums of random matrices.	Semantic Scholar
Different from other work (Ahlswede & Winter, 2002; Tropp, 2012; Hsu, Kakade, & Zhang, 2012), our tail results are based on the largest singular value (LSV) and independent of the matrix dimension.	Semantic Scholar
Since the LSV operation and the expectation are noncommutative, we introduce a diagonalization method to convert the LSV operation into the trace operation of an infinitely dimensional diagonal matrix.	Semantic Scholar
In this way, we obtain another version of Laplace-transform bounds and then achieve the LSV-based tail inequalities for sums of random matrices.	Semantic Scholar
For a nonautonomous class of n-dimensional differential system with infinite delays, we give sufficient conditions for its global exponential stability, without showing the existence of an equilibrium point, or a periodic solution, or an almost periodic solution.	Semantic Scholar
We apply our main result to several concrete neural network models, studied in the literature, and a comparison of results is given.	Semantic Scholar
Contrary to usual in the literature about neural networks, the assumption of bounded coefficients is not required to obtain the global exponential stability.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we present numerical examples to illustrate the effectiveness of our results.	Semantic Scholar
Tactile sensing is one important element that can enable robots to interact with an unstructured world.	Semantic Scholar
By having tactile perception, a robot can explore its environment by touching objects.	Semantic Scholar
Like human skin, a tactile sensor that can provide rich information such as distributed normal and shear forces with high density can help the robot to recognize objects.	Semantic Scholar
In previous work, we introduced uSkin, a soft skin with distributed 3-axis force-sensitive elements and a center-to-center distance between the 3-axis load cells of 4.7 mm for the flat version.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a new structure for the distributed soft force transducer that reduces the crosstalk between the components of the 3-axis force measurements.	Semantic Scholar
Three dimensionally (3-D) printing the silicone structure eased the prototype production.	Semantic Scholar
However, the 3-D printed material has a higher hysteresis than the previously used Ecoflex.	Semantic Scholar
Microcontroller boards originally developed for the skin of iCub were implemented for uSkin, increasing the readout frequency and reducing the space requirements and number of wires.	Semantic Scholar
The sensor was installed on iCub and successfully used for shape exploration.	Semantic Scholar

In this letter, we present an innovative design of bioinspired soft pneumatic actuators with built-in pressure and position sensors.	Semantic Scholar
The soft actuator is designed with segmented bending to mimic human finger motion.	Semantic Scholar
Bending angles between segments are measured by the built-in position sensors.	Semantic Scholar
On each segment, a pressure sensor is also built in.	Semantic Scholar
The pressure and position sensors are made of conductive elastomers and coprinted into the soft actuator in a single process without assembly.	Semantic Scholar
These sensors are capable of providing feedback because of their innovative design and the piezoresistive effect of conductive elastomers.	Semantic Scholar
Analysis and characterization are conducted for the pressure and position sensors.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, a prototype gripper is designed and fabricated using the two proposed soft actuators for grasping demonstration.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed soft actuator has potential for applications that require closed-loop control.	Semantic Scholar

A long-standing and influential hypothesis in neural information processing is that early sensory networks adapt themselves to produce efficient codes of afferent inputs.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we show how a nonlinear recurrent network provides an optimal solution for the efficient coding of an afferent input and its history.	Semantic Scholar
We specifically consider the problem of producing lightweight codes, ones that minimize both ℓ1 and ℓ2 constraints on sparsity and energy, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
When embedded in a linear coding paradigm, this problem results in a non-smooth convex optimization problem.	Semantic Scholar
We employ a proximal gradient descent technique to develop the solution, showing that the optimal code is realized through a recurrent network endowed with a nonlinear soft thresholding operator.	Semantic Scholar
The training of the network connection weights is readily achieved through gradient-based local learning.	Semantic Scholar
If such learning is assumed to occur on a slower time-scale than the (faster) recurrent dynamics, then the network as a whole converges to an optimal set of codes and weights via what is, in effect, an alternative minimization procedure.	Semantic Scholar
Our results show how the addition of thresholding nonlinearities to a recurrent network may enable the production of lightweight, history-sensitive encoding schemes.	Semantic Scholar
Big sensing data is prevalent in both industry and scientific research applications where the data is generated with high volume and velocity.	Semantic Scholar
Cloud computing provides a promising platform for big sensing data processing and storage as it provides a flexible stack of massive computing, storage, and software services in a scalable manner.	Semantic Scholar
Current big sensing data processing on Cloud have adopted some data compression techniques.	Semantic Scholar
However, due to the high volume and velocity of big sensing data, traditional data compression techniques lack sufficient efficiency and scalability for data processing.	Semantic Scholar
Based on specific on-Cloud data compression requirements, we propose a novel scalable data compression approach based on calculating similarity among the partitioned data chunks.	Semantic Scholar
Instead of compressing basic data units, the compression will be conducted over partitioned data chunks.	Semantic Scholar
To restore original data sets, some restoration functions and predictions will be designed.	Semantic Scholar
MapReduce is used for algorithm implementation to achieve extra scalability on Cloud.	Semantic Scholar
With real world meteorological big sensing data experiments on U-Cloud platform, we demonstrate that the proposed scalable compression approach based on data chunk similarity can significantly improve data compression efficiency with affordable data accuracy loss.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we aim to segment and detect water in videos.	Semantic Scholar
Water detection is beneficial for appllications such as video search, outdoor surveillance, and systems such as unmanned ground vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles.	Semantic Scholar
The specific problem, however, is less discussed compared to general texture recognition.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we analyze several motion properties of water.	Semantic Scholar
First, we describe a video preprocessing step, to increase invariance against water reflections and water colours.	Semantic Scholar
Second, we investigate the temporal and spatial properties of water and derive corresponding local descriptors.	Semantic Scholar
The descriptors are used to locally classify the presence of water and a binary water detection mask is generated through spatio-temporal Markov Random Field regularization of the local classifications.	Semantic Scholar
Third, we introduce the Video Water Database, containing several hours of water and non-water videos, to validate our algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental evaluation on the Video Water Database and the DynTex database indicates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, outperforming multiple algorithms for dynamic texture recognition and material recognition.	Semantic Scholar

Next best view (NBV) planning is a central task for automated three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction in robotics.	Semantic Scholar
The most expensive phase of NBV computation is the view simulation step, where the information gain of a large number of candidate sensor poses are estimated.	Semantic Scholar
Usually, information gain is related to the visibility of unknown space from the simulated viewpoint.	Semantic Scholar
A well-established technique is to adopt a volumetric representation of the environment and to compute the NBV from ray casting by maximizing the number of unknown visible voxels.	Semantic Scholar
This letter explores a novel approach for NBV planning based on surfel representation of the environment.	Semantic Scholar
Surfels are oriented surface elements, such as circular disks, without explicit connectivity.	Semantic Scholar
A new kind of surfel is introduced to represent the frontier between empty and unknown space.	Semantic Scholar
Surfels are extracted during 3-D reconstruction, with minimal overhead, from a KinectFusion volumetric representation.	Semantic Scholar
Surfel rendering is used to generate images from each simulated sensor pose.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments in a real robot setup are reported.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach achieves better performance than volumetric algorithms based on ray casting implemented on graphics processing unit (GPU), with comparable results in terms of reconstruction quality.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, surfel-based NBV planning can be applied in larger environments as a volumetric representation is limited by GPU memory.	Semantic Scholar
Large-scale multi-class image classification is essential for big data applications.	Semantic Scholar
One of the challenges is to deal with situations in which the number of classes is very large and for which the standard one-versus-all method is not appropriate because its computational complexity is linear in the number of classes.	Semantic Scholar
Using a label tree is a popular way to reduce complexity.	Semantic Scholar
By organizing classes into a hierarchical structure, the number of classifier evaluations of a test sample when traveling from the root node to a leaf node is significantly reduced.	Semantic Scholar
Having a balanced learned tree is essential to this approach.	Semantic Scholar
The current methods for learning the tree structure use clustering techniques, such as k-means or spectral clustering, to group confusing classes into clusters associated with the nodes.	Semantic Scholar
However, the output tree in such cases might not be balanced.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a method for learning effective and balanced trees by jointly optimizing balance and confusion constraints.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on large-scale datasets including Caltech-256, SUN-397, ILSVRC2010-1K, and ImageNet-10K, show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar

Mining High Average-Utility Itemsets (HAUIs) in a quantitative database is an extension of the traditional problem of frequent itemset mining, having several practical applications.	Semantic Scholar
Discovering HAUIs is more challenging than mining frequent itemsets using the traditional support model since the average-utilities of itemsets do not satisfy the downward-closure property.	Semantic Scholar
To design algorithms for mining HAUIs that reduce the search space of itemsets, prior studies have proposed various upper-bounds on the average-utilities of itemsets.	Semantic Scholar
However, these algorithms can generate a huge amount of unpromising HAUI candidates, which result in high memory consumption and long runtimes.	Semantic Scholar
To address this problem, this paper proposes four tight average-utility upper-bounds, based on a vertical database representation, and three efficient pruning strategies.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, a novel generic framework for comparing average-utility upper-bounds is presented.	Semantic Scholar
Based on these theoretical results, an efficient algorithm named dHAUIM is introduced for mining the complete set of HAUIs.	Semantic Scholar
dHAUIM represents the search space and quickly compute upper-bounds using a novel IDUL structure.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments show that dHAUIM outperforms four state-of-the-art algorithms for mining HAUIs in terms of runtime on both real-life and synthetic databases.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, results show that the proposed pruning strategies dramatically reduce the number of candidate HAUIs.	Semantic Scholar

The largest family of density-ratio based estimators is obtained for unnormalized statistical models under the assumption of properness.	Semantic Scholar
They do not require normalization of the probability density function (PDF) because they are based on the density ratio of the same PDF at different points; therefore, the multiplicative normalization constant cancels out.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast with most existing work, a single necessary and sufficient condition is given here, rather than merely sufficient conditions for proper criteria for estimation.	Semantic Scholar
The condition implies that an extended Bregman divergence framework with data-dependent noise (Gutmann & Hirayama, 2011) gives the largest family of proper criteria in the present case.	Semantic Scholar
This properness yields consistent estimation as long as some mild conditions are satisfied.	Semantic Scholar

We propose a probabilistic filtering method which fuses joint measurements with depth images to yield a precise, real-time estimate of the end-effector pose in the camera frame.	Semantic Scholar
This avoids the need for frame transformations when using it in combination with visual object tracking methods.	Semantic Scholar
Precision is achieved by modeling and correcting biases in the joint measurements as well as inaccuracies in the robot model, such as poor extrinsic camera calibration.	Semantic Scholar
We make our method computationally efficient through a principled combination of Kalman filtering of the joint measurements and asynchronous depth-image updates based on the Coordinate Particle Filter.	Semantic Scholar
We quantitatively evaluate our approach on a dataset recorded from a real robotic platform, annotated with ground truth from a motion capture system.	Semantic Scholar
We show that our method is robust and accurate even under challenging conditions such as fast motion, significant and long-term occlusions, and time-varying biases.	Semantic Scholar

The Ankle Mimicking Prosthetic Foot 3 is an energy efficient bionic foot using the principle of optimal power distribution.	Semantic Scholar
The main challenge behind this research is focussed on retrieving as much energy as possible from the gait and to incorporate an electric actuator with minimized power consumption.	Semantic Scholar
The Ankle Mimicking Prosthetic (AMP-) Foot 2, as a proof-of-concept, showed the advantage of using the Explosive Elastic Actuator capable of delivering the full ankle torques (±120Nm) and power (±250W ) with only a 60W motor.	Semantic Scholar
The novelty of this work is focussend on the addition of an extra locking mechanism to the AMP-Foot 3 which bring additional assets such as natural adaptability to different walking speeds and slopes and an improved energy storage during early stance implying a greater reduction of the power requirements of the motor to only 50W while still being able to produce the peak output torque and power necessary for walking.

In this paper, we investigate the grasping of rigid objects in a unilateral robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS).	Semantic Scholar
We define a human-centered transparency that quantifies the natural action and perception in RAMIS.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate this human-centered transparency analysis for different values of gripper scaling—the scaling between the grasp aperture of the surgeon-side manipulator and the aperture of the surgical instrument grasper.	Semantic Scholar
A total of 31 participants performed teleoperated grasping and perceptual assessment of rigid objects in one of three gripper scaling conditions (fine, normal, and quick, trading off precision and responsiveness).	Semantic Scholar
A psychophysical analysis of the variability of the maximal grasping aperture during prehension and of the reported size of the object revealed that under normal and quick (but not under the fine) gripper scaling conditions, the teleoperated grasping with our system was similar to natural grasping and, therefore, human-centered transparent.	Semantic Scholar
We anticipate that using motor control and psychophysics for human-centered optimization of teleoperation control will eventually improve the usability of RAMIS.	Semantic Scholar
Semi- or fully autonomous personal aerial vehicles (PAVs) are currently studied and developed by public and private organizations as a solution for traffic congestion.	Semantic Scholar
While optimal collision-free navigation algorithms have been proposed for autonomous robots, trajectories and accelerations for PAVs should also take into account human comfort.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a reactive decentralized collision avoidance strategy that incorporates passenger physiological comfort based on the optimal reciprocal collision avoidance strategy.	Semantic Scholar
We study in simulation the effects of increasing PAV densities on the level of comfort, on the relative flight time and on the number of collisions per flight hour and demonstrate that our strategy reduces collision risk for platforms with limited dynamic range.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we validate our strategy with a swarm of ten quadcopters flying outdoors.	Semantic Scholar

First, we design a quality measure for the distance between two whole trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
By quality, we mean that the distance measure can capture the complex characteristics of trajectories as a whole including their varying lengths and their constrained movement in the road network space.	Semantic Scholar
Second, we develop an algorithm that transforms whole trajectories in a road network space into multidimensional data points in a euclidean space while preserving their relative distances in the transformed metric space.	Semantic Scholar
This transformation enables us to effectively shift the clustering task for whole mobile object trajectories in the complex road network space to the traditional clustering task for multidimensional data in a euclidean space.	Semantic Scholar
Third, we develop a cluster validation method for evaluating the clustering quality in both the transformed metric space and the road network space.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experimental evaluation with trajectories generated on real road network maps of different cities shows that TraceMob produces higher quality clustering results and outperforms existing approaches by an order of magnitude.	Semantic Scholar
Throughout the nervous system, information is commonly coded in activity distributed over populations of neurons.	Semantic Scholar
In idealized situations where a single, continuous stimulus is encoded in a homogeneous population code, the value of the encoded stimulus can be read out without bias.	Semantic Scholar
However, in many situations, multiple stimuli are simultaneously present; for example, multiple motion patterns might overlap.	Semantic Scholar
Here we find that when multiple stimuli that overlap in their neural representation are simultaneously encoded in the population, biases in the read-out emerge.	Semantic Scholar
Although the bias disappears in the absence of noise, the bias is remarkably persistent at low noise levels.	Semantic Scholar
The bias can be reduced by competitive encoding schemes or by employing complex decoders.	Semantic Scholar
To study the origin of the bias, we develop a novel general framework based on gaussian processes that allows an accurate calculation of the estimate distributions of maximum likelihood decoders, and reveals that the distribution of estimates is bimodal for overlapping stimuli.	Semantic Scholar
The results have implications for neural coding and behavioral experiments on, for instance, overlapping motion patterns.	Semantic Scholar

Many daily life tasks require precise control when making contact with surfaces.	Semantic Scholar
Ensuring a smooth transition from free motion to contact is crucial as incurring a large impact force may lead to unstable contact with the robot bouncing on the surface, i.e., chattering.	Semantic Scholar
Stabilizing the forces at contact is not possible as the impact lasts for less than a millisecond, leaving no time for the robot to react to the impact force.	Semantic Scholar
We present a strategy in which the robot adapts its dynamic before entering into contact.	Semantic Scholar
The speed is modulated so as to align with the surface.	Semantic Scholar
We leverage the properties of autonomous dynamical systems for immediate replanning and handling unforeseen perturbations and exploit local modulations of the dynamics to control for the smooth transitions at contact.	Semantic Scholar
We show theoretically and empirically that by using the modulation framework, the robot can stably touch the contact surface, even when the surface's location is uncertain, at a desired location, and finally, leave the surface or stop on the surface at a desired point.	Semantic Scholar

We present a framework which allows standard stereo reconstruction to be unified with a wide range of classic top-down cues from urban scene understanding.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting algorithm is analogous to the human visual system where conflicting interpretations of the scene due to ambiguous data can be resolved based on a higher level understanding of urban environments.	Semantic Scholar
The cues which are reformulated within the framework include: recognising common arrangements of surface normals and semantic edges (e.g .	Semantic Scholar
concave, convex and occlusion boundaries), recognising connected or coplanar structures such as walls, and recognising collinear edges (which are common on repetitive structures such as windows).	Semantic Scholar
Recognition of these common configurations has only recently become feasible, thanks to the emergence of large-scale reconstruction datasets.	Semantic Scholar
To demonstrate the importance and generality of scene understanding during stereo-reconstruction, the proposed approach is integrated with 3 different state-of-the-art techniques for bottom-up stereo reconstruction.	Semantic Scholar
The use of high-level cues is shown to improve performance by up to 15 % on the Middlebury 2014 and KITTI datasets.	Semantic Scholar
We further evaluate the technique using the recently proposed HCI stereo metrics, finding significant improvements in the quality of depth discontinuities, planar surfaces and thin structures.	Semantic Scholar
We present a framework for planning energy-efficient trajectories through strong and uncertain disturbances, such as ocean currents and wind fields.	Semantic Scholar
First, we develop an iterative optimization algorithm for path planning.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm samples smoothly deformed paths around the current best path estimate.	Semantic Scholar
Using these samples the best path guess is updated based upon a user-defined cost function.	Semantic Scholar
Second, we present a number of different trajectory comparison metrics that allow a vehicle to intelligently choose when to switch to newly planned paths based on new information gathered about uncertain environmental disturbances.	Semantic Scholar
Results are shown for a simulated environment, for a regional ocean modeling system ocean current dataset, and for field trials conducted on a windy lake with a Platypus Lutra autonomous boat.	Semantic Scholar
These results show that 1) our path planning algorithm is able to plan more energy-efficient paths than STOMP and A*-based methods, 2) our replanning method plans paths that are more energy-efficient in the presence of uncertainty than planning only on the ocean current forecast, and 3) our algorithm is robust enough to deal with environments where limited amounts of data are available.

Microrobotics is a promising field that can revolutionize fields such as minimally invasive surgery.	Semantic Scholar
Applications such as micromanipulation can be performed more effectively using multiple microsized agents.	Semantic Scholar
These can be performed more accurately with the help of robust controllers.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we design a leader–follower controller that can be used to perform coordinated motion tasks.	Semantic Scholar
A prescribed performance controller is designed for the leader micro-agent whereas a synchronization controller is designed for the follower.	Semantic Scholar
The main difference between our method and the literature is that our method can achieve a prespecified control performance.	Semantic Scholar
The positions of the micro-agents are obtained using microscopic images and image processing.	Semantic Scholar
The velocities and accelerations of the micro-agents are obtained using state observers.	Semantic Scholar

In this paper, a planar underactuated cable-driven micro–macro robot is presented.	Semantic Scholar
The system consists of two-link passive serial manipulator attached to a cable-suspended parallel robot.	Semantic Scholar
The system is conceived for applications requiring point-to-point motions inside large workspaces in the presence of obstacles: The serial arm allows us to reach points close to the obstacles that would not be reachable by the cable robot alone due to cable–obstacle interference.	Semantic Scholar
The kinematic and dynamic models are presented and the differential flatness framework is applied to make the system controllable for point-to-point movements.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, a multiobjective optimization framework is presented, which allows us to choose the design parameters that minimize two conflicting objective functions (movement time and control effort) for a given movement task.	Semantic Scholar
This novel approach allows designers to infer useful information about the influence of the design parameters on the dynamic performance of the system.	Semantic Scholar

Using this model, we analyze the impacts of critical variables on a patient's readmission risk by the manipulation of such variables.	Semantic Scholar
Through this analysis, effective intervention options to reduce readmission can be identified, which can provide a quantitative tool for designing personalized interventions to reduce COPD readmissions.	Semantic Scholar

Master–slave control is a common form of human–robot interaction for robotic surgery.	Semantic Scholar
To ensure seamless and intuitive control, a mechanism of self-adaptive motion scaling during teleoperaton is proposed in this letter.	Semantic Scholar
The operator can retain precise control when conducting delicate or complex manipulation, while the movement to a remote target is accelerated via adaptive motion scaling.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed framework consists of three components: 1) situation awareness, 2) skill level awareness, and 3) task awareness.	Semantic Scholar
The self-adaptive motion scaling ratio allows the operators to perform surgical tasks with high efficiency, forgoing the need of frequent clutching and instrument repositioning.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed framework has been verified on a da Vinci Research Kit to assess its usability and robustness.	Semantic Scholar
An in-house database is constructed for offline model training and parameter estimation, including both the kinematic data obtained from the robot and visual cues captured through the endoscope.	Semantic Scholar
Detailed user studies indicate that a suitable motion-scaling ratio can be obtained and adjusted online.	Semantic Scholar
The overall performance of the operators in terms of control efficiency and task completion is significantly improved with the proposed framework.	Semantic Scholar
We design an optimal, driver-adaptive supervisor for collision avoidance at an intersection.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm is able to identify optimal corrections to the human-decided inputs and to keep the system collision free.	Semantic Scholar
To determine the set of safe control actions, we exploit the notion of maximal controlled invariant set.	Semantic Scholar
We leverage results from scheduling theory to verify the safety of a given control input, and propose an efficient optimization algorithm providing optimal solutions with respect to the drivers’ intent.	Semantic Scholar
We also present an approximate supervisor algorithm that can be solved in polynomial time and has guaranteed error bounds.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we validate our approach with simulation results, as well as on naturalistic data.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce Visibly Linear Temporal Logic (VLTL), a linear-time temporal logic that captures the full class of Visibly Pushdown Languages over infinite words.	Semantic Scholar
The novel logic avoids fix points and instead provides natural temporal operators with simple and intuitive semantics.	Semantic Scholar
We prove that the complexities of the satisfiability and visibly pushdown model checking problems are the same as for other well known logics, like CaRet and the nested word temporal logic NWTL, which in contrast are strictly more limited in expressive power than VLTL.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, formulas of CaRet and NWTL can be translated inductively and in linear-time into VLTL.	Semantic Scholar
We describe a flexible robotic skin module that can measure proximity, contact and force, as well as algorithms for detecting obstacles, human hands, and affective touch gestures.	Semantic Scholar
The computational requirements of the proposed architecture are in line with the capabilities of a small microcontroller, allowing for a majority of the data to be processed colocated with the skin.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting system only communicates low-bandwidth information of interest, thereby solving challenges in routing high-bandwidth information and reducing the burden on a robot's central processing unit.	Semantic Scholar

The exact and reliable understanding of driver behavior characteristics has a large potential contribution to the active safety control system, advanced driver assistance system, and intelligent traffic system.	Semantic Scholar
This study presents a driver behavior characteristics identification strategy based on bionic intelligent algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
First, a driver behavior data acquisition system is established to be used with test subjects of different driving skill levels for driving data acquisition.	Semantic Scholar
The preview optimal curvature model, which directly reflects the driver's behavior characteristics based on its parameters, is then chosen as the ideal driver behavior model and is identified through the genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and back propagation neural network.

Moreover, this paper discusses the application of driver behavior characteristics identification in an integrated chassis control system (ICC), which integrates active front steering with electronic stability control.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, simulations are performed to verify the identification results and the application in the ICC by PanoSim and MATLAB/Simulink software.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the results, the proposed identification strategy precisely characterized the driver behavior.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, its application in the ICC improved the path-following ability and vehicle stability performance of the drivers.	Semantic Scholar
Robots would perform better when their mechanical structure is specifically designed for their designated task, for instance by adding spring mechanisms.	Semantic Scholar
However, designing such mechanisms, which match the dynamics of the robot with the task, is hard and time consuming.	Semantic Scholar
To assist designers, a platform that automatically designs dynamical mechanisms is needed.	Semantic Scholar
This letter introduces a novel string-based representation for mechanisms, including evolutionary operators, that allows an evolutionary algorithm to automatically design dynamical mechanisms for a designated task.	Semantic Scholar
The mechanism representation allows simultaneous optimization of topology and parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation experiments investigate various algorithms to obtain best optimization performance.	Semantic Scholar
We show the efficacy of the representation, operators, and evolutionary algorithm by designing mechanisms that track straight lines and ellipses by virtue of both their kinematic and dynamic properties.	Semantic Scholar

In order to harness multi-source data for an informed place design, this paper presents “Public Sentiments and Activities in Places” multi-source data analysis flow (PSAP) in an Informed Design Platform (IDP).	Semantic Scholar
In terms of key contributions, PSAP implements 1) an Interconnected Data Model (IDM) to manage multi-source data independently and integrally, 2) an efficient and effective data mining mechanism based on multi-dimension and multi-measure queries (MMQs), and 3) concurrent data processing cascades with Sentiments in Places Analysis Mechanism (SPAM) and Activities in Places Analysis Mechanism (APAM), to fuse social network data with other data on public sentiment and activity comprehensively.

As proved by a holistic evaluation, both SPAM and APAM outperform compared methods.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, SPAM improves its classification accuracy gradually and significantly from 72.37 to about 85 percent within nine crowd-calibration cycles, and APAM with an ensemble classifier achieves the highest precision of 92.13 percent, which is approximately 13 percent higher than the second best method.

Finally, by applying MMQs on “Sentiment&Activity Linked Data”, various place design insights of our testbed are mined to improve its livability.	Semantic Scholar
Given a pedestrian image as a query, the purpose of person re-identification is to identify the correct match from a large collection of gallery images depicting the same person captured by disjoint camera views.	Semantic Scholar
The critical challenge is how to construct a robust yet discriminative feature representation to capture the compounded variations in pedestrian appearance.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, deep learning methods have been proposed to extract hierarchical features against extreme variability of appearance.	Semantic Scholar
However, existing methods in this category generally neglect the efficiency in the matching stage whereas the searching speed of a re-identification system is crucial in real-world applications.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a novel deep hashing framework with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for fast person re-identification.	Semantic Scholar
Technically, we simultaneously learn both CNN features and hash functions/codes to get robust yet discriminative features and similarity-preserving hash codes.	Semantic Scholar
Thereby, person re-identification can be resolved by efficiently computing and ranking the Hamming distances between images.	Semantic Scholar

Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is one of the most important supervised linear dimensional reduction techniques which seeks to learn low-dimensional representation from the original high-dimensional feature space through a transformation matrix, while preserving the discriminative information via maximizing the between-class scatter matrix and minimizing the within class scatter matrix.	Semantic Scholar
However, the conventional LDA is formulated to maximize the arithmetic mean of trace ratios which suffers from the domination of the largest objectives and might deteriorate the recognition accuracy in practical applications with a large number of classes.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a new criterion to maximize the weighted harmonic mean of trace ratios, which effectively avoid the domination problem while did not raise any difficulties in the formulation.	Semantic Scholar
An efficient algorithm is exploited to solve the proposed challenging problems with fast convergence, which might always find the globally optimal solution just using eigenvalue decomposition in each iteration.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method over both of synthetic datasets and real-life datasets for various tasks, including face recognition, human motion recognition and head pose recognition.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results indicate that our algorithm consistently outperforms other compared methods on all of the datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Norms are a valuable means of establishing coherent cooperative behaviour in decentralised systems in which there is no central authority.	Semantic Scholar
Axelrod’s seminal model of norm establishment in populations of self-interested individuals provides some insight into the mechanisms needed to support this through the use of metanorms, but considers only limited scenarios and domains.	Semantic Scholar
While further developments of Axelrod’s model have addressed some of the limitations, there is still only limited consideration of such metanorm models with more realistic topological configurations.	Semantic Scholar
In response, this paper tries to address such limitation by considering its application to different topological structures.	Semantic Scholar
Our results suggest that norm establishment is achievable in lattices and small worlds, while such establishment is not achievable in scale-free networks, due to the problematic effects of hubs.	Semantic Scholar
The paper offers a solution, first by adjusting the model to more appropriately reflect the characteristics of the problem, and second by offering a new dynamic policy adaptation approach to learning the right behaviour.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results demonstrate that this dynamic policy adaptation overcomes the difficulties posed by the asymmetric distribution of links in scale-free networks, leading to an absence of norm violation, and instead to norm emergence.	Semantic Scholar
Manipulation of deformable linear objects is a challenging task for robots.	Semantic Scholar
These objects have infinite-dimensional configuration space and are computational-expensive to model, making it difficult for real-time tracking, planning and control.	Semantic Scholar
To deal with these challenges, a uniform framework that includes state estimation, task planning, and trajectory planning is proposed in this letter based on the concept of coherent point drift (CPD).	Semantic Scholar
A real-time observer is proposed to estimate the states of deformable objects from the perceived point clouds.	Semantic Scholar
An online task planner is then developed to recognize the manipulation step according to the state estimation result.	Semantic Scholar
For trajectory planning, human operators first train robots example trajectories given several object states.	Semantic Scholar
In the test stage, a new feasible trajectory can be autonomously generated by a smooth transformation from training scenarios to test scenarios.	Semantic Scholar

By constructing the appropriate Lyapunov functional and utilizing the inequality technique, sufficient conditions are proposed to guarantee exponential synchronization of the coupled systems based on drive-response concept.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed results are very easy to verify, and they also extend some previous related works on memristor-based real-valued neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
Meanwhile, the obtained sufficient conditions of this paper may be conducive to qualitative analysis of some complex-valued nonlinear delayed systems.	Semantic Scholar
A numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.	Semantic Scholar
Since the work of Minsky and Papert (1969), it has been understood that single-layer neural networks cannot solve nonlinearly separable classifications (i.e., XOR).	Semantic Scholar
We describe and test a novel divergent autoassociative architecture capable of solving nonlinearly separable classifications with a single layer of weights.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed network consists of class-specific linear autoassociators.	Semantic Scholar
The power of the model comes from treating classification problems as within-class feature prediction rather than directly optimizing a discriminant function.	Semantic Scholar
We show unprecedented learning capabilities for a simple, single-layer network (i.e., solving XOR) and demonstrate that the famous limitation in acquiring nonlinearly separable problems is not just about the need for a hidden layer; it is about the choice between directly predicting classes or learning to classify indirectly by predicting features.

This paper describes an agent platform based on the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Systems Abstract Architecture, which, together with a highly fault tolerant, bio-inspired hardware architecture, aims to increase the reliability of future, low-cost satellites.	Semantic Scholar
To achieve the stringent operational requirements imposed by the real-time and resource-constrained environment of a satellite, the Hybrid Agent Real-Time Platform (HARP) distinguishes itself from other platforms in three areas.	Semantic Scholar
Firstly, the HARP middleware uses discrete processors, instead of virtual machines or interpreters, as its agent execution environment.	Semantic Scholar
This has the advantage of reducing the agency memory footprint and enabling agents to perform real-time tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Secondly, the HARP communication stack makes use of ISO-TP over CAN 2.0A as its transfer level protocol, cutting out resource-intensive layers such as HTTP and IIOP.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the communication stack allows real-time CAN traffic to share the network and be given priority over Agent Communication Language messages.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the HARP middleware embeds a peer-to-peer task manager in each agency, allowing systems which are built using the bio-inspired Artificial Stem Cell Architecture and HARP middleware to autonomously reconfigure in the event of failures.	Semantic Scholar
The detailed design of the HARP middleware is given, together with details of an implementation of the HARP middleware on a set of prototype satellite hardware.	Semantic Scholar
The performance and scaling potential of the middleware, determined through a set of physical experiments, provide evidence of the practical feasibility of the proposed architecture.	Semantic Scholar
Although they are powerful and successful in many applications, artificial neural networks (ANNs) typically do not perform well with complex problems that have a limited number of training cases.	Semantic Scholar
Often, collecting additional training data may not be feasible or may be costly.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, this work presents a new radial-basis network (RBN) design that overcomes the limitations of using ANNs to accurately model regression problems with minimal training data.	Semantic Scholar
This new design involves a multi-stage training process that couples an orthogonal least squares (OLS) technique with gradient-based optimization.	Semantic Scholar
New termination criteria are also introduced to improve accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the algorithms are designed to require minimal heuristic parameters, thus improving ease of use and consistency in performance.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach is tested with experimental and practical regression problems, and the results are compared with those from typical network models.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that the new design demonstrates improved accuracy with reduced dependence on the amount of training data.	Semantic Scholar
As demonstrated, this new ANN provides a platform for approximating potentially slow but high-fidelity computational models, and thus fostering inter-model connectivity and multi-scale modeling.	Semantic Scholar
In recent years there have been excellent results in visual-inertial odometry techniques, which aim to compute the incremental motion of the sensor with high accuracy and robustness.	Semantic Scholar
However, these approaches lack the capability to close loops and trajectory estimation accumulates drift even if the sensor is continually revisiting the same place.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a novel tightly coupled visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping system that is able to close loops and reuse its map to achieve zero-drift localization in already mapped areas.	Semantic Scholar
While our approach can be applied to any camera configuration, we address here the most general problem of a monocular camera, with its well-known scale ambiguity.	Semantic Scholar
We also propose a novel IMU initialization method, which computes the scale, the gravity direction, the velocity, and gyroscope and accelerometer biases, in a few seconds with high accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
We test our system in the 11 sequences of a recent micro-aerial vehicle public dataset achieving a typical scale factor error of $1\%$ and centimeter precision.	Semantic Scholar
We compare to the state-of-the-art in visual-inertial odometry in sequences with revisiting, proving the better accuracy of our method due to map reuse and no drift accumulation.	Semantic Scholar
We propose an efficient approach for building compact, edge-preserving, view-centric triangle meshes from either dense or sparse depth data, with a focus on modeling architecture in large-scale urban scenes.	Semantic Scholar
Our method constructs a 2D base mesh from a preliminary view partitioning, then lifts the base mesh into 3D in a fast vertex depth optimization.	Semantic Scholar
Different view partitioning schemes are proposed for imagery and dense depth maps.	Semantic Scholar
They guarantee that mesh edges are aligned with crease edges and discontinuities.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we introduce an effective plane merging procedure with a global error guarantee in order to maximally compact the resulting models.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, different strategies for detecting and handling discontinuities are presented.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate that our approach provides an excellent trade-off between quality and compactness, and is eligible for fast production of polyhedral building models from large-scale urban height maps, as well as, for direct meshing of sparse street-side Structure-from-Motion (SfM) data.

This paper introduces a context-aware system, named CAPFF, for helping people in filling paper forms, mainly in two contexts: 1) people have no idea of what should be filled in certain form fields; 2) people are not aware of the mistakes they are likely to commit in entering information, which may violate data entry constraints.	Semantic Scholar
In the offline phase, CAPFF provides a tool to build the knowledge about a given form, and such knowledge includes instructions, field-level examples, and constraints among form fields.	Semantic Scholar
In the online phase, when people set out to fill a paper form, the video camera of the system determines the position of the pen and then provides assistance, based on the user's form filling context.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluated CAPFF's performance through 450 paper form filling activities, and the results show that the proposed CAPFF is effective in terms of both accuracy and response time.	Semantic Scholar
Recent progress in Internet of Things (IoT) platforms has allowed us to collect large amounts of sensing data.	Semantic Scholar
However, there are significant challenges in converting this large-scale sensing data into decisions for real-world applications.	Semantic Scholar
Motivated by applications like health monitoring and intervention and home automation we consider a novel problem called Activity Prediction, where the goal is to predict future activity occurrence times from sensor data.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we make three main contributions.	Semantic Scholar
First, we formulate and solve the activity prediction problem in the framework of imitation learning and reduce it to a simple regression learning problem.	Semantic Scholar
This approach allows us to leverage powerful regression learners that can reason about the relational structure of the problem with negligible computational overhead.	Semantic Scholar
Second, we present several metrics to evaluate activity predictors in the context of real-world applications.	Semantic Scholar
Third, we evaluate our approach using real sensor data collected from 24 smart home testbeds.	Semantic Scholar
We also embed the learned predictor into a mobile-device-based activity prompter and evaluate the app for nine participants living in smart homes.	Semantic Scholar

It has been suggested that reactivation of previously acquired experiences or stored information in declarative memories in the hippocampus and neocortex contributes to memory consolidation and learning.	Semantic Scholar
Understanding memory consolidation depends crucially on the development of robust statistical methods for assessing memory reactivation.	Semantic Scholar
To date, several statistical methods have seen established for assessing memory reactivation based on bursts of ensemble neural spike activity during offline states.	Semantic Scholar
Using population-decoding methods, we propose a new statistical metric, the weighted distance correlation, to assess hippocampal memory reactivation (i.e., spatial memory replay) during quiet wakefulness and slow-wave sleep.	Semantic Scholar
The new metric can be combined with an unsupervised population decoding analysis, which is invariant to latent state labeling and allows us to detect statistical dependency beyond linearity in memory traces.	Semantic Scholar
We validate the new metric using two rat hippocampal recordings in spatial navigation tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Our proposed analysis framework may have a broader impact on assessing memory reactivations in other brain regions under different behavioral tasks.	Semantic Scholar
This article is concerned with the fixed-time stabilization for impulsive Cohen-Grossberg BAM neural networks via two different controllers.	Semantic Scholar
By using a novel constructive approach based on some comparison techniques for differential inequalities, an improvement theorem of fixed-time stability for impulsive dynamical systems is established.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, based on the fixed-time stability theorem of impulsive dynamical systems, two different control protocols are designed to ensure the fixed-time stabilization of impulsive Cohen-Grossberg BAM neural networks, which include and extend the earlier works.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, two simulations examples are provided to illustrate the validity of the proposed theoretical results.	Semantic Scholar
Robot calibration has been demonstrated to be a useful method to decrease the absolute positioning errors of a robot.	Semantic Scholar
Compared to the traditional calibration methods which require expensive external measurement devices, this paper proposes a stereo vision based self-calibration procedure which only needs a stereo cameramounted to a fixed location and a planarmarker attached to the robot end-effector.	Semantic Scholar
The procedure consists of three consecutive steps: the automatic generation of target configurations and trajectories based on the nominal geometric models of the robot; a camera and obstacles, marker poses estimated by the two stage estimation algorithm; and the kinematic parameters identification based on a local product of exponential (local POE) formulized error model.	Semantic Scholar
The advantage of this self-calibration method is that the whole robot camera system can be calibrated without anymanual intervention, which enables robot calibration to be completely online and suitable for the fast programming of the robot and computer vision combined work cell.	Semantic Scholar
A set of simulations and experiments on a UR5 robot demonstrate the convenience, efficiency and robustness of the proposed calibration procedure.	Semantic Scholar

Privacy concern in data sharing especially for health data gains particularly increasing attention nowadays.	Semantic Scholar
Now, some patients agree to open their information for research use, which gives rise to a new question of how to effectively use the public information to better understand the private dataset without breaching privacy.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we specialize this question as selecting an optimal subset of the public dataset for M-estimators in the framework of differential privacy (DP) in [1] .	Semantic Scholar
From a perspective of non-interactive learning, we first construct the weighted private density estimation from the hybrid datasets under DP.	Semantic Scholar
Along the same line as [2] , we analyze the accuracy of the DP M-estimators based on the hybrid datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Our main contributions are (i) we find that the bias-variance tradeoff in the performance of our M-estimators can be characterized in the sample size of the released dataset; (ii) based on this finding, we develop an algorithm to select the optimal subset of the public dataset to release under DP.	Semantic Scholar
Our simulation studies and application to the real datasets confirm our findings and set a guideline in the real application.	Semantic Scholar
Recognition ability and, more broadly, machine learning techniques enable robots to perform complex tasks and allow them to function in diverse situations.	Semantic Scholar
In fact, robots can easily access an abundance of sensor data that are recorded in real time such as speech, image, and video.	Semantic Scholar
Since such data are time sensitive, processing them in real time is a necessity.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, machine learning techniques are known to be computationally intensive and resource hungry.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, an individual resource-constrained robot, in terms of computation power and energy supply, is often unable to handle such heavy real-time computations alone.	Semantic Scholar
To overcome this obstacle, we propose a framework to harvest the aggregated computational power of several low-power robots for enabling efficient, dynamic, and real-time recognition.	Semantic Scholar
Our method adapts to the availability of computing devices at runtime and adjusts to the inherit dynamics of the network.	Semantic Scholar
Our framework can be applied to any distributed robot system.	Semantic Scholar
To demonstrate, with several Raspberry-Pi3-based robots (up to 12) each equipped with a camera, we implement a state-of-the-art action recognition model for videos and two recognition models for images.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach allows a group of multiple low-power robots to obtain a similar performance (in terms of the number of images or video frames processed per second) compared to a high-end embedded platform, Nvidia Tegra TX2.	Semantic Scholar
unknown	Semantic Scholar
High-density electrocorticogram (ECoG) electrodes are capable of recording neurophysiological data with high temporal resolution with wide spatial coverage.	Semantic Scholar
These recordings are a window to understanding how the human brain processes information and subsequently behaves in healthy and pathologic states.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we describe and implement delay differential analysis (DDA) for the characterization of ECoG data obtained from human patients with intractable epilepsy.	Semantic Scholar
DDA is a time-domain analysis framework based on embedding theory in nonlinear dynamics that reveals the nonlinear invariant properties of an unknown dynamical system.	Semantic Scholar
The DDA embedding serves as a low-dimensional nonlinear dynamical basis onto which the data are mapped.	Semantic Scholar
This greatly reduces the risk of overfitting and improves the method's ability to fit classes of data.	Semantic Scholar
Since the basis is built on the dynamical structure of the data, preprocessing of the data (e.g., filtering) is not necessary.	Semantic Scholar
We performed a large-scale search for a DDA model that best fit ECoG recordings using a genetic algorithm to qualitatively discriminate between different cortical states and epileptic events for a set of 13 patients.	Semantic Scholar
A single DDA model with only three polynomial terms was identified.	Semantic Scholar
Singular value decomposition across the feature space of the model revealed both global and local dynamics that could differentiate electrographic and electroclinical seizures and provided insights into highly localized seizure onsets and diffuse seizure terminations.	Semantic Scholar
Other common ECoG features such as interictal periods, artifacts, and exogenous stimuli were also analyzed with DDA.	Semantic Scholar
This novel framework for signal processing of seizure information demonstrates an ability to reveal unique characteristics of the underlying dynamics of the seizure and may be useful in better understanding, detecting, and maybe even predicting seizures.	Semantic Scholar
Each person has a different personal space and behaves differently when another person approaches.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this observation, we propose a novel method to learn how to approach a person comfortably based on the person's preference while avoiding uncomfortable encounters.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a personal comfort field to learn each person's preference about an approaching object.	Semantic Scholar
A personal comfort field is based on existing theories in anthropology and personalized for each user through repeated encounters.	Semantic Scholar
We propose an online method to learn a personal comfort field of a user, i.e., personalized learning, based on the concept from the Gaussian process upper confidence bound and show that the proposed method has no regret asymptotically.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness of the proposed method has been extensively validated in simulation and real-world experiments.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that the proposed method can gradually learn the personalized approaching behavior preferred by the user as the number of encounters increases.	Semantic Scholar
Reducing the use of agrochemicals is an important component toward sustainable agriculture.	Semantic Scholar
Robots that can perform targeted weed control offer the potential to contribute to this goal, for example, through specialized weeding actions such as selective spraying or mechanical weed removal.	Semantic Scholar
A prerequisite of such systems is a reliable and robust plant classification system that is able to distinguish crop and weed in the field.	Semantic Scholar
A major challenge in this context is the fact that different fields show a large variability.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, classification systems have to robustly cope with substantial environmental changes with respect to weed pressure and weed types, growth stages of the crop, visual appearance, and soil conditions.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a novel crop-weed classification system that relies on a fully convolutional network with an encoder-decoder structure and incorporates spatial information by considering image sequences.	Semantic Scholar
Exploiting the crop arrangement information that is observable from the image sequences enables our system to robustly estimate a pixel-wise labeling of the images into crop and weed, i.e., a semantic segmentation.	Semantic Scholar
We provide a thorough experimental evaluation, which shows that our system generalizes well to previously unseen fields under varying environmental conditions—a key capability to actually use such systems in precision framing.	Semantic Scholar
We provide comparisons to other state-of-the-art approaches and show that our system substantially improves the accuracy of crop-weed classification without requiring a retraining of the model.	Semantic Scholar
Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with the softmax loss have achieved remarkable successes in a number of close-set recognition problems, e.g.	Semantic Scholar
object recognition, action recognition, etc.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike these close-set tasks, face recognition is an open-set problem where the testing classes (persons) are usually different from those in training.	Semantic Scholar
This paper addresses the open-set property of face recognition by developing the center loss.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, the center loss simultaneously learns a center for each class, and penalizes the distances between the deep features of the face images and their corresponding class centers.	Semantic Scholar
Training with the center loss enables CNNs to extract the deep features with two desirable properties: inter-class separability and intra-class compactness.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we extend the center loss in two aspects.	Semantic Scholar
First, we adopt parameter sharing between the softmax loss and the center loss, to reduce the extra parameters introduced by centers.	Semantic Scholar
Second, we generalize the concept of center from a single point to a region in embedding space, which further allows us to account for intra-class variations.	Semantic Scholar
The advanced center loss significantly enhances the discriminative power of deep features.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that our method achieves high accuracies on several important face recognition benchmarks, including Labeled Faces in the Wild, YouTube Faces, IJB-A Janus, and MegaFace Challenging 1.	Semantic Scholar
By controlling the state of neuronal populations, neuromodulators ultimately affect behavior.	Semantic Scholar
A key neuromodulation mechanism is the alteration of neuronal excitability via the modulation of ion channel expression.	Semantic Scholar
This type of neuromodulation is normally studied with conductance-based models, but those models are computationally challenging for large-scale network simulations needed in population studies.	Semantic Scholar
This article studies the modulation properties of the multiquadratic integrate-and-fire model, a generalization of the classical quadratic integrate-and-fire model.	Semantic Scholar
The model is shown to combine the computational economy of integrate-and-fire modeling and the physiological interpretability of conductance-based modeling.	Semantic Scholar
It is therefore a good candidate for affordable computational studies of neuromodulation in large networks.	Semantic Scholar
In robotics, controlling the stiffness of the joints that contribute to the robots’ degree of freedom dictates the adaptability, versatility, and safety of the whole system.	Semantic Scholar
We can achieve variable stiffness or impedance in a robotic system purely by the control or by introducing new material or mechanisms to address cases that require innate safety through system compliancy.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents JammJoint, a compliant and flexible wearable robot, which uses jamming of granular media to vary its stiffness.	Semantic Scholar
It consists of a silicone sleeve with hollow sections that are filled with cubic rubber granules and subjected to different levels of vacuum pressure.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike contemporary vacuum-based actuators or systems, JammJoint is wearable, portable, and autonomous: It uses a powerful miniature vacuum pump, a small battery, and bluetooth-enabled electronics.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments revolving around bending and torsional stiffness show that the system is able to achieve up to a fourfold increase in spring stiffness.	Semantic Scholar
Further measurements of individual variable stiffness structures indicate that for other modes of deformation, including simply supported bending or compression for alternative linear applications, higher changes in stiffness over a factor of seven are possible.	Semantic Scholar
These aspects make mobile jamming-based stiffness variation as wearable joint assistance promising for future applications such as rehabilitation after injuries and joint support in challenging working conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Business to Business (B2B) marketing aims at meeting the needs of other businesses instead of individual consumers, and thus entails management of more complex business needs than consumer marketing.	Semantic Scholar
The buying processes of the business customers involve series of different marketing campaigns providing multifaceted information about the products or services.	Semantic Scholar
While most existing studies focus on individual consumers, little has been done to guide business customers due to the dynamic and complex nature of these business buying processes.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, in this paper, we focus on providing a unified view of social and temporal modeling for B2B marketing campaign recommendation.	Semantic Scholar
Along this line, we first exploit the temporal behavior patterns in the B2B buying processes and develop a marketing campaign recommender system.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we start with constructing a temporal graph as the knowledge representation of the buying process of each business customer.	Semantic Scholar
Temporal graph can effectively extract and integrate the campaign order preferences of individual business customers.	Semantic Scholar
It is also worth noting that our system is backward compatible since the participating frequency used in conventional static recommender systems is naturally embedded in our temporal graph.	Semantic Scholar
The campaign recommender is then built in a low-rank graph reconstruction framework based on probabilistic graphical models.	Semantic Scholar
Our framework can identify the common graph patterns and predict missing edges in the temporal graphs.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, since business customers very often have different decision makers from the same company, we also incorporate social factors, such as community relationships of the business customers, for further improving overall performances of the missing edge prediction and recommendation.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we have performed extensive empirical studies on real-world B2B marketing data sets and the results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the quality of the campaign recommendations for challenging B2B marketing tasks.	Semantic Scholar
This letter analyzes the visual–inertial sensor fusion problem in the cooperative case of two agents, and proves that this sensor fusion problem is equivalent to a simple polynomial equations system that consists of several linear equations and three polynomial equations of second degree.	Semantic Scholar
The analytic solution of this polynomial equations system is easily obtained by using an algebraic method.	Semantic Scholar
In other words, this letter provides the analytic solution to the visual–inertial sensor fusion problem in the case of two agents.	Semantic Scholar
The power of the analytic solution is twofold.	Semantic Scholar
From one side, it allows us to determine the relative state between the agents (i.e., relative position, speed, and orientation) without the need of an initialization.	Semantic Scholar
From another side, it provides fundamental insights into all the theoretical aspects of the problem.	Semantic Scholar
This letter mainly focuses on the first issue.	Semantic Scholar
However, the analytic solution is also exploited to obtain basic structural properties of the problem that characterize the observability of the absolute scale and the relative orientation.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive simulations and real experiments show that the solution is successful in terms of precision and robustness.	Semantic Scholar
"This paper presents an algorithm called <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\varepsilon ^{\star }$</tex-math> </inline-formula>, for online coverage path planning of unknown environment."	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm is built upon the concept of an Exploratory Turing Machine (ETM), which acts as a supervisor to the autonomous vehicle to guide it with adaptive navigation commands.	Semantic Scholar
The ETM generates a coverage path online using Multiscale Adaptive Potential Surfaces (MAPS), which are hierarchically structured and dynamically updated based on sensor information.	Semantic Scholar
"The <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\varepsilon ^{\star }$</tex-math></inline-formula>-algorithm is computationally efficient, guarantees complete coverage, and does not suffer from the local extrema problem."	Semantic Scholar
Its performance is validated by 1) high-fidelity simulations on Player/Stage and 2) actual experiments in a laboratory setting on autonomous vehicles.	Semantic Scholar
This article addresses the challenge of planning coordinated activities for a set of autonomous agents, who coordinate according to social commitments among themselves.	Semantic Scholar
We develop a multi-agent plan in the form of a commitment protocol that allows the agents to coordinate in a flexible manner, retaining their autonomy in terms of the goals they adopt so long as their actions adhere to the commitments they have made.	Semantic Scholar
We consider an expressive first-order setting with probabilistic uncertainty over action outcomes.	Semantic Scholar
We contribute the first practical means to derive protocol enactments which maximise expected utility from the point of view of one agent.	Semantic Scholar
Our work makes two main contributions.	Semantic Scholar
First, we show how Hierarchical Task Network planning can be used to enact a previous semantics for commitment and goal alignment, and we extend that semantics in order to enact first-order commitment protocols.	Semantic Scholar
Second, supposing a cooperative setting, we introduce uncertainty in order to capture the reality that an agent does not know for certain that its partners will successfully act on their part of the commitment protocol.	Semantic Scholar
Altogether, we employ hierarchical planning techniques to check whether a commitment protocol can be enacted efficiently, and generate protocol enactments under a variety of conditions.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting protocol enactments can be optimised either for the expected reward or the probability of a successful execution of the protocol.	Semantic Scholar
We illustrate our approach on a real-world healthcare scenario.	Semantic Scholar
Identifying regions of interest in an image has long been of great importance in a wide range of tasks, including place recognition.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a novel attention mechanism with flexible context, which can be incorporated into existing feedforward network architecture to learn image representations for long-term place recognition.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, in order to focus on regions that contribute positively to place recognition, we introduce a multiscale context-flexible network to estimate the importance of each spatial region in the feature map.	Semantic Scholar
Our model is trained end-to-end for place recognition and can detect regions of interest of arbitrary shape.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of our approach and the results demonstrate that our model can achieve consistently better performance than the state of the art on standard benchmark datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we visualize the learned attention maps to generate insights into what attention the network has learned.	Semantic Scholar
We prove that by successively combining subassemblies, we can achieve <italic>sublinear</italic> construction times for “staged” assembly of microscale objects from a large number of tiny particles, for vast classes of shapes; this is a significant advance in the context of programmable matter and self-assembly for building high-yield microfactories.	Semantic Scholar
The underlying model has particles moving under the influence of uniform external forces until they hit an obstacle; particles bond when forced together with a compatible particle.	Semantic Scholar
"Previous work considered sequential composition of objects, resulting in construction time that is <italic>linear</italic> in the number <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$N$</tex-math></inline-formula> of particles, which is inefficient for large <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$N$</tex-math></inline-formula>."	Semantic Scholar
Our progress implies critical speedup for constructible shapes; for convex polyominoes, even a <italic>constant</italic> construction time is possible.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that our construction process can be used for pipelining, resulting in an <italic>amortized constant</italic> production time.	Semantic Scholar
Many localization algorithms use a spatiotemporal window of sensory information in order to recognize spatial locations, and the length of this window is often a sensitive parameter that must be tuned to the specifics of the application.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a general method for environment-driven variation of the length of the spatiotemporal window based on searching for the most significant localization hypothesis, to use as much context as is appropriate but not more.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate this approach on benchmark datasets using visual and Wi-Fi sensor modalities and a variety of sensory comparison front-ends under in-order and out-of-order traversals of the environment.	Semantic Scholar
Our results show that the system greatly reduces the maximum distance traveled without localization compared to a fixed-length approach while achieving competitive localization accuracy, and our proposed method achieves this performance without deployment-time tuning.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a prototype-based classification model for evolving data streams, called SyncStream, which allows dynamically modeling time-changing concepts, making predictions in a local fashion.	Semantic Scholar
Instead of learning a single model on a fixed or adaptive sliding window of historical data or ensemble learning a set of weighted base classifiers, SyncStream captures evolving concepts by dynamically maintaining a set of prototypes in a proposed P-Tree, which are obtained based on the error-driven representativeness learning and synchronization-inspired constrained clustering.	Semantic Scholar
To identify abrupt concept drifts in data streams, PCA and statistical analysis based heuristic approaches have been introduced.	Semantic Scholar
To further learn the associations among distributed data streams, the extended P-Tree structure and KNN-style strategy are introduced.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate that our new data stream classification approach has several attractive benefits: (a) SyncStream is capable of dynamically modeling the evolving concepts from even a small set of prototypes.	Semantic Scholar
(b) Owing to synchronization-based constrained clustering and P-Tree, SyncStream supports efficient and effective data representation and maintenance.	Semantic Scholar
(c) SyncStream is also tolerant of inappropriate or noisy examples via error-driven representativeness learning.	Semantic Scholar
(d) SyncStream allows learning relationship among distributed data streams at the instance level.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results indicate its efficiency and effectiveness.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we demonstrate light field triangulation to determine depth distances and baselines in a plenoptic camera.	Semantic Scholar
Advances in micro lenses and image sensors have enabled plenoptic cameras to capture a scene from different viewpoints with sufficient spatial resolution.	Semantic Scholar
While object distances can be inferred from disparities in a stereo viewpoint pair using triangulation, this concept remains ambiguous when applied in the case of plenoptic cameras.	Semantic Scholar
We present a geometrical light field model allowing the triangulation to be applied to a plenoptic camera in order to predict object distances or specify baselines as desired.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown that distance estimates from our novel method match those of real objects placed in front of the camera.	Semantic Scholar
Additional benchmark tests with an optical design software further validate the model’s accuracy with deviations of less than ±0.33% for several main lens types and focus settings.	Semantic Scholar
A variety of applications in the automotive and robotics field can benefit from this estimation model.	Semantic Scholar
We describe a proof of the Central Limit Theorem that has been formally verified in the Isabelle proof assistant.	Semantic Scholar
Our formalization builds upon and extends Isabelle’s libraries for analysis and measure-theoretic probability.	Semantic Scholar
The proof of the theorem uses characteristic functions, which are a kind of Fourier transform, to demonstrate that, under suitable hypotheses, sums of random variables converge weakly to the standard normal distribution.	Semantic Scholar
We also discuss the libraries and infrastructure that supported the formalization, and reflect on some of the lessons we have learned from the effort.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a novel absolute value inequalities discriminant analysis (AVIDA) criterion for supervised dimensionality reduction.	Semantic Scholar
Compared with the conventional linear discriminant analysis (LDA), the main characteristics of our AVIDA are robustness and sparseness.	Semantic Scholar
"By reformulating the generalized eigenvalue problem in LDA to a related SVM-type ""concave-convex"" problem based on absolute value inequalities loss, our AVIDA is not only more robust to outliers and noises, but also avoids the SSS problem."	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the additional L1-norm regularization term in the objective makes sure sparse discriminant vectors are obtained.	Semantic Scholar
A successive linear algorithm is employed to solve the proposed optimization problem, where a series of linear programs are solved.	Semantic Scholar
The superiority of our AVIDA is supported by experimental results on artificial examples as well as benchmark image databases.	Semantic Scholar
This paper is concerned with various types of allocation problems in fair division of indivisible goods, aiming at maximin share, proportional share, and minimax share allocations.	Semantic Scholar
However, such allocations do not always exist, not even in very simple settings with two or three agents.	Semantic Scholar
A natural question is to ask, given a problem instance, what is the largest value c for which there is an allocation such that every agent has utility of at least c times her fair share.	Semantic Scholar
We first prove that the decision problem of checking if there exists a minimax share allocation for a given problem instance is $$\mathrm {NP}$$ NP -hard when the agents’ utility functions are additive.	Semantic Scholar
We then show that, for each of the three fairness notions, one can approximate c by a polynomial-time approximation scheme, assuming that the number of agents is fixed.	Semantic Scholar
Next, we investigate the restricted cases when utility functions have values in $$\{0,1\}$$ {0,1} only or are defined based on scoring vectors (Borda and lexicographic vectors), and we obtain several tractability results for these cases.	Semantic Scholar
Interestingly, we show that maximin share allocations can always be found efficiently with Borda utilities, which cannot be guaranteed for general additive utilities.	Semantic Scholar
In the nonadditive setting, we show that there exists a problem instance for which there is no c-maximin share allocation, for any constant c. We explore a class of symmetric submodular utilities for which there exists a tight $$\frac{1}{2}$$ 12 -maximin share allocation, and show how it can be approximated to within a factor of $$\nicefrac {1}{4}$$ 14 .	Semantic Scholar
Interest in series elastic actuators (SEAs) for assistive robots has recently increased due to the unique properties of SEAs compared to those of rigid actuators, such as high force control accuracy, low output impedance, and tolerance to shocks.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, an SEA with a clutch for an assistive robot is designed for accurate torque delivery to provide effective assistance.	Semantic Scholar
The mechanical clutch controls the engagement and disengagement of the power transmission during the gait cycle to ensure transparency and user safety.	Semantic Scholar
Precise torque control is the main challenge in the control of SEAs.	Semantic Scholar
The addition of a clutch in the SEA will result in a new force control challenge with the frequent release and engagement of the clutch aggravating the mechanical vibration and bringing the risk of unsafety to the assistive robot wearer.	Semantic Scholar
A new torque control method based on interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) for SEAs is adopted for the physical human–robot interaction.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments are conducted to verify that the IDA-PBC-based SEA torque controller can effectively control actuator timing and allow precise assistive torque control.	Semantic Scholar
This letter serves as a stepping stone toward utilizing and designing assistive robots to assist with walking.	Semantic Scholar
Robot assistants and professional coworkers are becoming a commodity in domestic and industrial settings.	Semantic Scholar
In order to enable robots to share their workspace with humans and physically interact with them, fast and reliable handling of possible collisions on the entire robot structure is needed, along with control strategies for safe robot reaction.	Semantic Scholar
The primary motivation is the prevention or limitation of possible human injury due to physical contacts.	Semantic Scholar
In this survey paper, based on our early work on the subject, we review, extend, compare, and evaluate experimentally model-based algorithms for real-time collision detection, isolation, and identification that use only proprioceptive sensors.	Semantic Scholar
This covers the context-independent phases of the collision event pipeline for robots interacting with the environment, as in physical human–robot interaction or manipulation tasks.	Semantic Scholar
The problem is addressed for rigid robots first and then extended to the presence of joint/transmission flexibility.	Semantic Scholar
The basic physically motivated solution has already been applied to numerous robotic systems worldwide, ranging from manipulators and humanoids to flying robots, and even to commercial products.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a method for learning a reactive policy for a simple dynamic locomotion task involving hard impact and switching contacts where we assume the contact location and contact timing to be unknown.	Semantic Scholar
To learn such a policy, we use optimal control to optimize a local controller for a fixed environment and contacts.	Semantic Scholar
We learn the contact-rich dynamics for our underactuated systems along these trajectories in a sample efficient manner.	Semantic Scholar
We use the optimized policies to learn the reactive policy in form of a neural network.	Semantic Scholar
Using a new neural network architecture, we are able to preserve more information from the local policy and make its output interpretable in the sense that its output in terms of desired trajectories, feedforward commands and gains can be interpreted.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive simulations demonstrate the robustness of the approach to changing environments, outperforming a model-free gradient policy based methods on the same tasks in simulation.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we show that the learned policy can be robustly transferred on a real robot.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, a deep learning approach has been developed to carry out road detection by fusing LIDAR point clouds and camera images.	Semantic Scholar
An unstructured and sparse point cloud is first projected onto the camera image plane and then upsampled to obtain a set of dense 2D images encoding spatial information.	Semantic Scholar
Several fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) are then trained to carry out road detection, either by using data from a single sensor, or by using three fusion strategies: early, late, and the newly proposed cross fusion.	Semantic Scholar
Whereas in the former two fusion approaches, the integration of multimodal information is carried out at a predefined depth level, the cross fusion FCN is designed to directly learn from data where to integrate information; this is accomplished by using trainable cross connections between the LIDAR and the camera processing branches.	Semantic Scholar
To further highlight the benefits of using a multimodal system for road detection, a data set consisting of visually challenging scenes was extracted from driving sequences of the KITTI raw data set.	Semantic Scholar
It was then demonstrated that, as expected, a purely camera-based FCN severely underperforms on this data set.	Semantic Scholar
A multimodal system, on the other hand, is still able to provide high accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the proposed cross fusion FCN was evaluated on the KITTI road benchmark where it achieved excellent performance, with a MaxF score of 96.03%, ranking it among the top-performing approaches.	Semantic Scholar

This letter tackles the problem of independent control of multiple degrees of freedom (DoF) systems based on local magnetic actuation (LMA).	Semantic Scholar
This is achieved by means of a modular disturbance rejection scheme, with the aim of enhancing the range of use of multiple-DoF LMAs in dexterous surgical manipulators.	Semantic Scholar
An LMA actuation unit consists of a pair of permanent magnets, characterized by diametrical magnetization, acting as magnetic gears across the abdominal wall.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, the model of the LMA and the time-varying magnetic disturbances owing to the proximity of multiple units are discussed.	Semantic Scholar
Subsequently, the developed model is capitalized in order to establish a Kalman state observer for the purpose of developing a sensor-free endoscopic manipulator suited to infer the state of the internal side of the LMA.	Semantic Scholar
Afterwards, the same model is used to develop an adaptive feedforward compensator system, with the aim of balancing the magnetic torques acting on the LMAs from the neighboring units in the case of unknown and frequency-varying sinusoidal disturbances.	Semantic Scholar
The effect of a magnetic shield, realized by means of <italic>MuMetal </italic> is also analyzed.	Semantic Scholar
The overall control system is modular with respect to the number of units and requires no centralized intelligence.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed scheme is subsequently validated by means of experiments performed on a benchtop platform, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	Semantic Scholar

Distributed data stream management systems (DDSMS) are usually composed of upper layer relational query systems (RQS) and lower layer stream processing systems (SPS).	Semantic Scholar
When users submit new queries to RQS, a query planner needs to be converted into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) consisting of tasks which are running on SPS.	Semantic Scholar
Based on different query requests and data stream properties, SPS need to configure different deployments strategies.	Semantic Scholar
However, how to dynamically predict deployment configurations of SPS to ensure the processing throughput and low resource usage is a great challenge.	Semantic Scholar
This article presents OrientStream, a framework for automating characterization deployment in DDSMS using incremental machine learning techniques.	Semantic Scholar
By introducing the data-level, query plan-level, operator-level, and cluster-level’s four-level feature extraction mechanism, we first use the different query workloads as training sets to predict the resource usage by DDSMS, and select the optimal resource configuration from candidate settings based on the current query requests and stream properties, then migrate the operator state by introducing dynamic reconfiguration.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we validate our approach on the open source SPS–Storm.	Semantic Scholar
In view of the application scenarios with long monitoring cycle and non-frequent data fluctuation, experiments show that OrientStream can reduce CPU usage of 8-15 percent and memory usage of 38-48 percent, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
Recent work in magnetically actuated microscale robots for biomedical or microfluidic applications has resulted in magnetic actuation systems that can remotely command precise five-degree-of-freedom control of magnetic devices.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a new type of actuation system, which uses an array of rotating permanent magnets to generate the same level of control over untethered microscale devices with the potential for increased field and gradient strength and minimal heat generation.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast with previous permanent-magnet actuation systems, the system proposed here does not require any hazardous translational motion of the control magnets, resulting in a simple, safe, and inexpensive system.	Semantic Scholar
The proof-of-concept prototype system presented, with eight permanent magnets, can create fields and field gradients in any direction with variable magnitudes between zero and 30 mT and  ${0.83\,\text{Tm}}^{- 1}$, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness of the system is shown through characterization and feedback control of a 250-μm micromagnet in a 3-D path-following task with average accuracy of 25 μm.	Semantic Scholar
An optimization framework is presented for designing system configurations for targeted applications.	Semantic Scholar
Fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) copes with the stability-plasticity dilemma by the adaptive resonance theory (ART).	Semantic Scholar
Despite such an advantage, Fuzzy ARTMAP suffers from a category proliferation problem, which leads to a high number of categories and a decrease in performance for unseen patterns.	Semantic Scholar
Such drawbacks are mainly caused by the overlapping region (noise) between classes.	Semantic Scholar
To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a Fuzzy ARTMAP-based architecture robust to noise, named OnARTMAP, for both online and batch learning.	Semantic Scholar
Our neural networks (OnARTMAP1 and OnARTMAP2) proposed for batch learning have a two-stage learning process, while our neural network (OnARTMAPo) for online and incremental learning has just a single iterative process.	Semantic Scholar
Two new modules are proposed, the overlapping region detection module (ORDM) and another one similar to ARTa, called ARTc.	Semantic Scholar
The ORDM finds the overlapping region between categories, while the ARTc computes and stores special categories for overlapping areas.	Semantic Scholar
In our architecture proposal, the weights for ordinary categories are estimated from data outside the overlapping area.	Semantic Scholar
An alternative to the second stage strategy for batch learning is presented and focuses on improving the generalization performance.	Semantic Scholar
On the basis of our achievements, one can infer that OnARTMAP can improve the generalization performance and decrease the number of categories.	Semantic Scholar
Our proposals were applied to artificial and real datasets, as well as were compared with several counterparts (Fuzzy ARTMAP, ART-EMAP, μARTMAP, and BARTMAP).	Semantic Scholar
Discovering evolving communities in dynamic networks is essential to important applications such as analysis for dynamic web content and disease progression.	Semantic Scholar
Evolutionary clustering uses the temporal smoothness framework that simultaneously maximizes the clustering accuracy at the current time step and minimizes the clustering drift between two successive time steps.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose two evolutionary nonnegative matrix factorization (ENMF) frameworks for detecting dynamic communities.	Semantic Scholar
To address the theoretical relationship among evolutionary clustering algorithms, we first prove the equivalence relationship between ENMF and optimization of evolutionary modularity density.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we extend the theory by proving the equivalence between evolutionary spectral clustering and ENMF, which serves as the theoretical foundation for hybrid algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the equivalence, we propose a semi-supervised ENMF (sE-NMF) by incorporating a priori information into ENMF.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike the traditional semi-supervised algorithms, a priori information is integrated into the objective function of the algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is to escape the local optimal solution without increasing time complexity.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results over a number of artificial and real world dynamic networks illustrate that the proposed method is not only more accurate but also more robust than the state-of-the-art approaches.	Semantic Scholar

In this work, we propose an alternative formulation to the problem of ground reflectivity grid-based localization involving laser-scanned data from multiple LIDARs mounted on autonomous vehicles.	Semantic Scholar
The driving idea of our localization formulation is an alternative edge reflectivity grid representation, which is invariant to laser source, angle of incidence, range, and robot surveying motion.	Semantic Scholar
Such a property eliminates the need of the postfactory reflectivity calibration whose time requirements are infeasible in mass-produced robots/vehicles.	Semantic Scholar
Our experiments demonstrate that we can achieve better performance than state of the art on ground reflectivity inference-map-based localization at no additional computational burden.	Semantic Scholar
Wearable cameras allow people to record their daily activities from a user-centered (First Person Vision) perspective.	Semantic Scholar
Due to their favorable location, wearable cameras frequently capture the hands of the user, and may thus represent a promising usermachine interaction tool for different applications.	Semantic Scholar
Existent First Person Vision methods handle hand segmentation as a backgroundforeground problem, ignoring two important facts: i) hands are not a single ”skin-like” moving element, but a pair of interacting cooperative entities, ii) close hand interactions may lead to hand-to-hand occlusions and, as a consequence, create a single hand-like segment.	Semantic Scholar
These facts complicate a proper understanding of hand movements and interactions.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach extends traditional background-foreground strategies, by including a hand-identification step (left-right) based on a Maxwell distribution of angle and position.	Semantic Scholar
Hand-to-hand occlusions are addressed by exploiting temporal superpixels.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results show that, in addition to a reliable left/right hand-segmentation, our approach considerably improves the traditional background-foreground hand-segmentation.	Semantic Scholar
Robots have the potential to save lives in high-risk situations, such as emergency evacuations.	Semantic Scholar
To realize this potential, we must understand how factors such as the robot's performance, the riskiness of the situation, and the evacuee's motivation influence his or her decision to follow a robot.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we developed a set of experiments that tasked individuals with navigating a virtual maze using different methods to simulate an evacuation.	Semantic Scholar
Participants chose whether or not to use the robot for guidance in each of two separate navigation rounds.	Semantic Scholar
The robot performed poorly in two of the three conditions.	Semantic Scholar
The participant's decision to use the robot and self-reported trust in the robot served as dependent measures.	Semantic Scholar
A 53% drop in self-reported trust was found when the robot performs poorly.	Semantic Scholar
Self-reports of trust were strongly correlated with the decision to use the robot for guidance ( $\phi ({90}) = + 0.745$).	Semantic Scholar
We conclude that a mistake made by a robot will cause a person to have a significantly lower level of trust in it in later interactions.	Semantic Scholar

Automatic camera planning for sports has been a long term goal in computer vision and machine learning.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study camera planning for soccer games using pan, tilt and zoom (PTZ) cameras.	Semantic Scholar
Two important problems have been addressed.	Semantic Scholar
First, we propose the Overlapped Hidden Markov Model (OHMM) method which effectively optimizes the camera trajectory in overlapped local windows.	Semantic Scholar
The OHMM method significantly improves the smoothness of the camera planning by optimizing the camera trajectory in the temporal space, resulting in much more natural camera movements present in real broadcasts.	Semantic Scholar
We also propose CalibMe which is a highly automatic camera calibration method for soccer games.	Semantic Scholar
CalibMe enables users to collect large amounts of training data for learning algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
The precision of CalibMe is evaluated on a motion blur affected sequence and outperforms several strong existing methods.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of the OHMM method is extensively evaluated on both synthetic and real data.	Semantic Scholar
It outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of smoothness without sacrificing accuracy.	Semantic Scholar

Memory models that store new memories by forgetting old ones have memory lifetimes that are rather short and grow only logarithmically in the number of synapses.	Semantic Scholar
Attempts to overcome these deficits include “complex” models of synaptic plasticity in which synapses possess internal states governing the expression of synaptic plasticity.	Semantic Scholar
Integrate-and-express, filter-based models of synaptic plasticity propose that synapses act as low-pass filters, integrating plasticity induction signals before expressing synaptic plasticity.	Semantic Scholar
Such mechanisms enhance memory lifetimes, leading to an initial rise in the memory signal that is in radical contrast to other related, but nonintegrative, memory models.	Semantic Scholar
Because of the complexity of models with internal synaptic states, however, their dynamics can be more difficult to extract compared to “simple” models that lack internal states.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we show that by focusing only on processes that lead to changes in synaptic strength, we can integrate out internal synaptic states and effectively reduce complex synapses to simple synapses.	Semantic Scholar
For binary-strength synapses, these simplified dynamics then allow us to work directly in the transitions in perceptron activation induced by memory storage rather than in the underlying transitions in synaptic configurations.	Semantic Scholar
This permits us to write down master and Fokker-Planck equations that may be simplified under certain, well-defined approximations.	Semantic Scholar
These methods allow us to see that memory based on synaptic filters can be viewed as an initial transient that leads to memory signal rise, followed by the emergence of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-like dynamics that return the system to equilibrium.	Semantic Scholar
We may use this approach to compute mean first passage time–defined memory lifetimes for complex models of memory storage.	Semantic Scholar
In order for the lower limb exoskeletons to realize their considerable potential, a greater understanding of optimal assistive performance is required.	Semantic Scholar
While others have shown positive results, the fundamental question of how the exoskeleton interacts with the human remains unknown.	Semantic Scholar
Understanding the optimal assistance magnitude is not simply relevant for control, it is a critical knowledge for exoskeleton designers.	Semantic Scholar
An accurate understanding of assistance levels will enable the designers to minimize exoskeleton mass and improve the performance by avoiding excessive actuators and drivetrains.	Semantic Scholar
We explored the relationship between the assistance magnitude and the energetic cost benefits by using a series elastic actuator driven powered hip exoskeleton.	Semantic Scholar
The exoskeleton controller mimics a human biological hip moment to provide the assistance during the gait cycle.	Semantic Scholar
Ten able-bodied subjects walked using the exoskeleton with different magnitudes of assistance in both hip flexion and extension.	Semantic Scholar
Generally, the resulting metabolic cost across different assistance conditions showed a U-shape trend which was consistent across all subjects (p < 0.01).	Semantic Scholar
The interpreted optimal assistance point through the quadratic fit resulted in a 6% metabolic cost reduction with respect to the no-assistance condition.	Semantic Scholar
The study validated that simply increasing the assistance level did not yield higher energetic return.	Semantic Scholar
The efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD) depends in part on the post-operative programming of stimulation parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Closed-loop stimulation is one method to realize the frequent adjustment of stimulation parameters.	Semantic Scholar

This approach was tested in a computational model of basal ganglia-thalamic network.	Semantic Scholar
The autoregressive Volterra model was used to identify the process model based on physiological data.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation results illustrated the efficiency of closed-loop stimulation methods (amplitude adjustment and frequency adjustment) in improving the relay reliability of thalamic neurons compared with the PD state.	Semantic Scholar
Besides, compared with the 130Hz constant DBS the closed-loop stimulation methods can significantly reduce the energy consumption.	Semantic Scholar
Through the analysis of inter-spike-intervals (ISIs) distribution of basal ganglia neurons, the evoked network activity by the closed-loop frequency adjustment stimulation was closer to the normal state.	Semantic Scholar

Researchers building spiking neural networks face the challenge of improving the biological plausibility of their model networks while maintaining the ability to quantitatively characterize network behavior.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we extend the theory behind the neural engineering framework (NEF), a method of building spiking dynamical networks, to permit the use of a broad class of synapse models while maintaining prescribed dynamics up to a given order.	Semantic Scholar
This theory improves our understanding of how low-level synaptic properties alter the accuracy of high-level computations in spiking dynamical networks.	Semantic Scholar
For completeness, we provide characterizations for both continuous-time (i.e., analog) and discrete-time (i.e., digital) simulations.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the utility of these extensions by mapping an optimal delay line onto various spiking dynamical networks using higher-order models of the synapse.	Semantic Scholar
We show that these networks nonlinearly encode rolling windows of input history, using a scale invariant representation, with accuracy depending on the frequency content of the input signal.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we reveal that these methods provide a novel explanation of time cell responses during a delay task, which have been observed throughout hippocampus, striatum, and cortex.	Semantic Scholar
Visual graph interfaces improve the usability of graph databases by making it easier for users to formulate queries.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, a variety of interactive query formulation-based techniques (e.g., blending of visual query construction and processing, visual query suggestions) have been proposed to enhance query performance and usability.	Semantic Scholar
Comprehensive user studies are needed to exhaustively and systematically evaluate performance of the proposed techniques, but, unfortunately, user studies are expensive and time consuming.	Semantic Scholar
To reduce the cost and time needed, we present a novel synthetic visual subgraph query simulator called ViSual.	Semantic Scholar
ViSual realistically simulates subgraph query construction without requiring human users.	Semantic Scholar
It can automatically generate test subgraph queries having different user-specified characteristics by utilizing the underlying indexes and simulate their formulation based on different query formulation sequences.	Semantic Scholar
A key feature of this simulator is that it is built on top of an hci-inspired, extensible  quantitative model which enables us to model the visual query formulation process quantitatively.	Semantic Scholar
Our experimental study demonstrates the effectiveness of ViSual in accurately simulating visual subgraph queries.	Semantic Scholar

We present a novel adaptive oscillator, called Adaptive Natural Oscillator (ANO), to exploit the natural dynamics of a given robotic system.	Semantic Scholar
This tool is built upon the Adaptive Frequency Oscillator (AFO), and it can be used as a pattern generator in robotic applications such as locomotion systems.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to AFO, that adapts to the frequency of an external signal, ANO adapts the frequency of reference trajectory to the natural dynamics of the given system.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we prove that, in linear systems, ANO converges to the system’s natural frequency.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we show that this tool exploits the natural dynamics for energy efficiency through minimization of actuator effort.	Semantic Scholar
This property makes ANO an appealing tool for energy consumption reduction in cyclic tasks; especially in legged systems.	Semantic Scholar
We also extend the proposed adaptation mechanism to high dimensional and general cases; such as n-DOF manipulators.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, by investigating a hopper leg in simulation, we show the efficacy of ANO in face of dynamical discontinuities; such as those inherent in legged locomotion.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we apply ANO to a simulated compliant robotic manipulator performing a periodic task where the energy consumption is drastically reduced.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the experimental results on a 1-DOF compliant joint show that our adaptive oscillator, despite all practical uncertainties and deviations from theoretical models, exploits the natural dynamics and reduces the energy consumption.	Semantic Scholar
Anticipating future situations from streaming sensor data is a key perception challenge for mobile robotics and automated vehicles.	Semantic Scholar
We address the problem of predicting the path of objects with multiple dynamic modes.	Semantic Scholar
The dynamics of such targets can be described by a Switching Linear Dynamical System (SLDS).	Semantic Scholar
However, predictions from this probabilistic model cannot anticipate when a change in dynamic mode will occur.	Semantic Scholar
We propose to extract various types of cues with computer vision to provide context on the target’s behavior, and incorporate these in a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN).	Semantic Scholar
The DBN extends the SLDS by conditioning the mode transition probabilities on additional context states.	Semantic Scholar
We describe efficient online inference in this DBN for probabilistic path prediction, accounting for uncertainty in both measurements and target behavior.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach is illustrated on two scenarios in the Intelligent Vehicles domain concerning pedestrians and cyclists, so-called Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs).	Semantic Scholar
Here, context cues include the static environment of the VRU, its dynamic environment, and its observed actions.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments using stereo vision data from a moving vehicle demonstrate that the proposed approach results in more accurate path prediction than SLDS at the relevant short time horizon (1 s).	Semantic Scholar
It slightly outperforms a computationally more demanding state-of-the-art method.	Semantic Scholar
Signed networks with positive and negative links attract considerable interest in their studying since they contain more information than unsigned networks.	Semantic Scholar
Community detection and sign (or attitude) prediction are still primary challenges, as the fundamental problems of signed network analysis.	Semantic Scholar
For this, a generative Bayesian approach is presented wherein 1) a signed stochastic blockmodel is proposed to characterize the community structure in the context of signed networks, by explicit formulating the distributions of the density and frustration of signed links from a stochastic perspective, and 2) a model learning algorithm is advanced by theoretical deriving a variational Bayes EM for the parameter estimation and variation-based approximate evidence for the model selection.	Semantic Scholar
The comparison of the above approach with the state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world networks, shows its advantage in the community detection and sign prediction for the exploratory networks.	Semantic Scholar

8 Probabilistic completeness is an important property in motion planning.	Semantic Scholar
Although it has been established with clear assumptions for geometric planners, the panorama of completeness results for kinodynamic planners is still incomplete, as most existing proofs rely on strong assumptions that are difficult, if not impossible, to verify on practical systems.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we focus on an important class of kinodynamic planners, namely those that interpolate trajectories in the state space.	Semantic Scholar
We provide a proof of probabilistic completeness for such planners under assumptions that can be readily verified from the system’s equations of motion and the user-defined interpolation function.	Semantic Scholar
Our proof relies crucially on a property of interpolated trajectories, termed second-order continuity (SOC), which we show is tightly related to the ability of a planner to benefit from denser sampling.	Semantic Scholar
We analyze the impact of this property in simulations on a low-torque pendulum.	Semantic Scholar
Our results show that a simple RRT using a second-order continuous interpolation swiftly finds solution, while it is impossible for the same planner using standard Bezier curves (which are not SOC) to find any solution.1	Semantic Scholar
Introducing mobile robots into the collaborative assembly process poses unique challenges for ensuring efficient and safe human–robot interaction.	Semantic Scholar
Current human–robot work cells require the robot to cease operating completely whenever a human enters a shared region of the given cell, and the robots do not explicitly model or adapt to the behavior of the human.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we present a human-aware robotic system with single-axis mobility that incorporates both predictions of human motion and planning in time to execute efficient and safe motions during automotive final assembly.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our system in simulation against three alternative methods, including a baseline approach emulating the behavior of standard safety systems in factories today.	Semantic Scholar
We also assess the system within a factory test environment.	Semantic Scholar
Through both live demonstration and results from simulated experiments, we show that our approach produces statistically significant improvements in quantitative measures of safety and fluency of interaction.	Semantic Scholar
Over-segmentation, or super-pixel generation, is a common preliminary stage for many computer vision applications.	Semantic Scholar
New acquisition technologies enable the capturing of 3D point clouds that contain color and geometrical information.	Semantic Scholar
This 3D information introduces a new conceptual change that can be utilized to improve the results of over-segmentation, which uses mainly color information, and to generate clusters of points we call super-points.	Semantic Scholar
We consider a variety of possible 3D extensions of the Local Variation (LV) graph based over-segmentation algorithms, and compare them thoroughly.	Semantic Scholar
We consider different alternatives for constructing the connectivity graph, for assigning the edge weights, and for defining the merge criterion, which must now account for the geometric information and not only color.	Semantic Scholar

Webly-supervised learning has recently emerged as an alternative paradigm to traditional supervised learning based on large-scale datasets with manual annotations.	Semantic Scholar
The key idea is that models such as CNNs can be learned from the noisy visual data available on the web.	Semantic Scholar
In this work we aim to exploit web data for video understanding tasks such as action recognition and detection.	Semantic Scholar
One of the main problems in webly-supervised learning is cleaning the noisy labeled data from the web.	Semantic Scholar
The state-of-theart paradigm relies on training a first classifier on noisy data that is then used to clean the remaining dataset.	Semantic Scholar
Our key insight is that this procedure biases the second classifier towards samples that the first one understands.	Semantic Scholar
Here we train two independent CNNs, a RGB network on web images and video frames and a second network using temporal information from optical flow.	Semantic Scholar
We show that training the networks independently is vastly superior to selecting the frames for the flow classifier by using our RGB network.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we show benefits in enriching the training set with different data sources from heterogeneous public web databases.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate that our framework outperforms all other webly-supervised methods on two public benchmarks, UCF-101 and Thumos’14.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study inequality query (IQ query) processing in tuple independent probabilistic databases, where IQ queries can be categorized into IQ-path, IQ-tree, and IQ-graph queries.	Semantic Scholar
We focus on two related issues for IQ queries.	Semantic Scholar
One issue is to efficiently compute their probabilities, with the observation that the time complexity of the state-of-the-art algorithm to process IQ-graph queries is high.	Semantic Scholar
The other issue is to efficiently perform their sensitivity analysis, which has not been studied before.	Semantic Scholar
Here, sensitivity analysis is to identify input tuples that have high influence on the probability of an answer tuple, and the influence of an input tuple is defined as the difference between the output probabilities obtained in two cases, where we assume that the tuple exists in one case and does not exist in the other one.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we compile the inequality conditions of an IQ query q into a compilation tree T, which encodes the Shannon expansion order.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we split q into a set of subqueries and each contains only one inequality condition.	Semantic Scholar
Using compilation tree and decomposition, we introduce a dynamic programming algorithm called Dec to process an IQ query q in time O(IΦI), where Φ is the lineage of q.	Semantic Scholar
An IQ query can be processed by our Dec if and only if its inequality conditions can be compiled into a compilation tree T and the inequality conditions from any node to all of its child nodes must be the same in T. We conduct extensive experiments using real and synthetic datasets to demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm for computing the probabilities and influences of IQ queries.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate a low-cost telerobotic system that leverages commercial virtual reality (VR) technology and integrates it with existing robotics control infrastructure.	Semantic Scholar
The system runs on a commercial gaming engine using off-the-shelf VR hardware and can be deployed on multiple network architectures.	Semantic Scholar
The system is based on the homunculus model of mind wherein we embed the user in a VR control room.	Semantic Scholar
The control room allows for multiple sensor displays, and dynamic mapping between the user and robot.	Semantic Scholar
This dynamic mapping allows for selective engagement between the user and the robot.	Semantic Scholar
We compared our system with state-of-the-art automation algorithms and standard VR-based telepresence systems by performing a user study.	Semantic Scholar
The study showed that new users were faster and more accurate than the automation or a direct telepresence system.	Semantic Scholar
We also demonstrate that our system can be used for pick and place, assembly, and manufacturing tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Haptic feedback not only affects the quality of training but can also influence the physical design of robotic gait trainers by determining how much force needs to be applied to the user and the nature of the force.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents the design of a variable damping force tunnel and explores the effect of the shape and strength of the damping field using ALEX III, a treadmill-based exoskeleton developed at Columbia University.	Semantic Scholar
The study consists of 32 healthy subjects who were trained for 40 min in the device.	Semantic Scholar
The subjects were trained to follow a footpath with a 50% increase in step height, so the foot would have 1.5 times the ground clearance.	Semantic Scholar
Subjects were assigned to one of four groups: linear high, linear low, parabolic high, and parabolic low.	Semantic Scholar
Linear or parabolic denotes the shape of the damping field, and high or low denotes the rate of change (strength) of the field based on error.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown that the new controller is capable of inducing gait adaptations in healthy individuals while walking in the device.	Semantic Scholar
All groups showed adaptations in step height, while only the high strength groups showed changes in normalized error area, a measure of how closely the desired path was followed.	Semantic Scholar
SimRank is a similarity measure between vertices in a graph.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, many algorithms have been proposed to efficiently evaluate SimRank similarities.	Semantic Scholar
However, the existing algorithms either overlook uncertainty in graph structures or depends on an unreasonable assumption.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study SimRank on uncertain graphs.	Semantic Scholar
Following the random-walk-based formulation of SimRank on deterministic graphs and the possible world model of uncertain graphs, we first define random walks on uncertain graphs and show that our definition of random walks satisfies Markov’s property.	Semantic Scholar
We formulate our SimRank measure based on random walks on uncertain graphs.	Semantic Scholar
We discover a critical difference between random walks on uncertain graphs and random walks on deterministic graphs, which makes all existing SimRank computation algorithms on deterministic graphs inapplicable to uncertain graphs.	Semantic Scholar

There is extensive literature on using convex optimization to derive piece-wise polynomial trajectories for controlling differential flat systems with applications to three-dimensional flight for Micro Aerial Vehicles.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we propose a method to formulate trajectory generation as a quadratic program (QP) using the concept of a Safe Flight Corridor (SFC).	Semantic Scholar
The SFC is a collection of convex overlapping polyhedra that models free space and provides a connected path from the robot to the goal position.	Semantic Scholar
We derive an efficient convex decomposition method that builds the SFC from a piece-wise linear skeleton obtained using a fast graph search technique.	Semantic Scholar
The SFC provides a set of linear inequality constraints in the QP allowing real-time motion planning.	Semantic Scholar
Because the range and field of view of the robot's sensors are limited, we develop a framework of Receding Horizon Planning , which plans trajectories within a finite footprint in the local map, continuously updating the trajectory through a re-planning process.	Semantic Scholar

We show the feasibility of our approach, its completeness and performance, with applications to high-speed flight in both simulated and physical experiments using quadrotors.	Semantic Scholar
This letter concerns surveillance planning for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that is requested to periodically take snapshots of areas of interest by visiting a given set of waypoint locations in the shortest time possible.	Semantic Scholar
The studied problem can be considered as a variant of the combinatorial traveling salesman problem in which trajectories between the waypoints respect the kinematic constraints of the UAV.	Semantic Scholar
Contrary to the existing formulation for curvature-constrained vehicles known as the Dubins traveling salesman problem, the herein addressed problem is motivated by planning for multirotor UAVs which are not limited by the minimal required forward velocity and minimal turning radius as the Dubins vehicle, but rather by the maximal speed and acceleration.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the waypoints to be visited can be at different altitudes, and the addressed problem is to find a fast and smooth trajectory in three-dimensional (3-D) space from which all the areas of interest can be captured.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed solution is based on unsupervised learning in which the requested 3-D smooth trajectory is determined as a sequence of Bézier curves in a finite number of learning epochs.	Semantic Scholar
The reported results support feasibility of the proposed solution which has also been experimentally verified with a real UAV.	Semantic Scholar
Origami-inspired machines are a promising approach to robotic transformation.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a new method for transformation that uses dynamic response to change the mountain–valley fold pattern.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a dynamic model and validate it through experimental characterization of sample mechanisms.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate that these mechanisms reliably change their dynamic behavior at a discrete switching frequency, and this frequency can be changed by varying the stiffness and mass of the mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
This indicates that mechanisms can be designed to respond to different frequencies and selectively transform from a global input.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate a three-fingered gripping mechanism with a single actuator that can transform between four nontrivial configurations.	Semantic Scholar
We believe that this approach can be applied to several types of origami structures.	Semantic Scholar
Neurons integrate information from many neighbors when they process information.	Semantic Scholar
Inputs to a given neuron are thus indistinguishable from one another.	Semantic Scholar
Under the assumption that neurons maximize their information storage, indistinguishability is shown to place a strong constraint on the distribution of strengths between neurons.	Semantic Scholar
The distribution of individual synapse strengths is found to follow a modified Boltzmann distribution with strength proportional to .	Semantic Scholar
The model is shown to be consistent with experimental data from Caenorhabditis elegans connectivity and in vivo synaptic strength measurements.	Semantic Scholar

Classical long short-term memory neural network (LSTMNN) generally faces the challenges of poor generalization property and low training efficiency in state degradation trend prediction of rotating machinery.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a novel quantum neural network called quantum weighted long short-term memory neural network (QWLSTMNN) is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
First, quantum bits are introduced into the long short-term memory unit to express network weights and activity values.	Semantic Scholar
Then, a new learning algorithm based on quantum phase-shift gate and quantum gradient descent is presented to quickly update the quantum parameters of weight qubits and activity qubits.	Semantic Scholar
The above characteristics endow QWLSTMNN with better nonlinear approximation capability, higher generalization property and faster convergence speed than LSTMNN.	Semantic Scholar
State degradation trend prediction for rolling bearings demonstrates that higher prediction accuracy and higher computational efficiency can be obtained due to the advantages of QWLSTMNN in terms of nonlinear approximation capability, generalization property and convergence speed.	Semantic Scholar
It is believed that the proposed method based on QWLSTMNN is effective for state degradation trend prediction of rotating machinery.	Semantic Scholar
Worker selection is a key issue in mobile crowd sensing (MCS).	Semantic Scholar
While the previous worker selection approaches mainly focus on selecting a proper subset of workers for a single MCS task, a multitask-oriented worker selection is essential and useful for the efficiency of large-scale MCS platforms.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes ActiveCrowd, a worker selection framework for multitask MCS environments.	Semantic Scholar
We study the problem of multitask worker selection under two situations: worker selection based on workers’ intentional movement for time-sensitive tasks and unintentional movement for delay-tolerant tasks.	Semantic Scholar
For time-sensitive tasks, workers are required to move to the task venue intentionally and the goal is to minimize the total distance moved.	Semantic Scholar
For delay-tolerant tasks, we select workers whose route is predicted to pass by the task venues and the goal is to minimize the total number of workers.	Semantic Scholar
Two greedy-enhanced genetic algorithms are proposed to solve them.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments verify that the proposed algorithms outperform baseline methods under different experiment settings (scale of task sets, available workers, varied task distributions, etc.	Semantic Scholar
).	Semantic Scholar
The goal of online active learning is to learn predictive models from a sequence of unlabeled data given limited label query budget.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike conventional online learning tasks, online active learning is considerably more challenging because of two reasons.	Semantic Scholar
First, it is difficult to design an effective query strategy to decide when is appropriate to query the label of an incoming instance given limited query budget.	Semantic Scholar
Second, it is also challenging to decide how to update the predictive models effectively whenever the true label of an instance is queried.	Semantic Scholar
Most existing approaches for online active learning are often based on a family of first-order online learning algorithms, which are simple and efficient but fall short in the slow convergence and sub-optimal solution in exploiting the labeled training data.	Semantic Scholar
To solve these issues, this paper presents a novel framework of Second-order Online Active Learning (SOAL) by fully exploiting both the first-order and second-order information.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed algorithms are able to achieve effective online learning efficacy, maximize the predictive accuracy, and minimize the labeling cost.	Semantic Scholar
To make SOAL more practical for real-world applications, especially for class-imbalanced online classification tasks (e.g., malicious web detection), we extend the SOAL framework by proposing the Cost-sensitive Second-order Online Active Learning algorithm named “SOAL$_{CS}$ ”, which is devised by maximizing the sum of weighted sensitivity and specificity or minimizing the cost of weighted mistakes of different classes.

We conducted both theoretical analysis and empirical studies, including an extensive set of experiments on a variety of large-scale real-world datasets, in which the promising empirical results validate the efficacy and scalability of the proposed algorithms towards large-scale online learning tasks.

Heterogeneous graph is a popular data model to represent the real-world relations with abundant semantics.	Semantic Scholar
To analyze heterogeneous graphs, an important step is extracting homogeneous graphs from the heterogeneous graphs, called homogeneous graph extraction.	Semantic Scholar
In an extracted homogeneous graph, the relation is defined by a line pattern on the heterogeneous graph and the new attribute values of the relation are calculated by user-defined aggregate functions.	Semantic Scholar
The key challenges of the extraction problem are how to efficiently enumerate paths matched by the line pattern and aggregate values for each pair of vertices from the matched paths.	Semantic Scholar
To address above two challenges, we propose a parallel graph extraction framework, where we use vertex-centric model to enumerate paths and compute aggregate functions in parallel.	Semantic Scholar
The framework compiles the line pattern into a path concatenation plan, which determines the order of concatenating paths and generates the final paths in a divide-and-conquer manner.	Semantic Scholar
"We introduce a cost model to estimate the cost of a plan and discuss three plan selection strategies, among which the best plan can enumerate paths in <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mathcal {O}(log(l))$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""huang-ieq1-2716939.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> iterations, where <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$l$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""huang-ieq2-2716939.gif""/> </alternatives></inline-formula> is the length of a pattern."	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, to improve the performance of evaluating aggregate functions, we classify the aggregate functions into three categories, i.e., distributive aggregation, algebraic aggregation, and holistic aggregation.	Semantic Scholar
Since the distributive and algebraic aggregations can be computed from the partial paths, we speed up the aggregation by computing partial aggregate values during the path enumeration.	Semantic Scholar
A new density-based clustering algorithm, <italic>RNN-DBSCAN</italic>, is presented which uses reverse nearest neighbor counts as an estimate of observation density.	Semantic Scholar

<italic>RNN-DBSCAN</italic> is preferable to the popular density-based clustering algorithm <italic>DBSCAN</italic> in two aspects.	Semantic Scholar
"First, problem complexity is reduced to the use of a single parameter (choice of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""bryant-ieq2-2787640.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> nearest neighbors), and second, an improved ability for handling large variations in cluster density (heterogeneous density)."

From which states and with what controls can a biped avoid falling or reach a given target state?	Semantic Scholar
What is the most robust way to do these?	Semantic Scholar
So as to help with the design of walking robot controllers, and perhaps give insights into human walking, we address these questions using two simple 2-D models: the inverted pendulum (IP) and linear inverted pendulum (LIP).	Semantic Scholar
Each has one state variable at mid-stance, i.e., hip velocity, and two state-dependent controls at each step, i.e., push-off magnitude and step length (IP) and step time and length (LIP).	Semantic Scholar
"Using practical targets and constraints, we compute all combinations of initial states and control actions for the next step, such that the robot can, with the best possible future controls, avoid falling for <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$n$ </tex-math></inline-formula> steps or reach a target within <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$n$</tex-math> </inline-formula> steps."	Semantic Scholar
All such combinations constitute regions in the combined space of states and controls.	Semantic Scholar
Farther from the boundaries of these regions, the robot tolerates larger errors and disturbances.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, for these models, and thus possibly real bipeds, usually if it is possible to avoid falling, it is possible to reach the target, and if it is possible to reach the target, it is possible to do so in two steps.	Semantic Scholar
The adoption of robots in rehabilitation medicine settings has become increasingly attractive in recent years.	Semantic Scholar
Robots are capable of providing repetitive, high-intensity physiotherapy.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we apply kinesthetic teaching principles to a robotic system in order to allow it to first learn and then imitate a therapist's behavior while assisting a patient in a lower-limb therapy task.	Semantic Scholar
A therapist's assistance in lifting a patient during treadmill-based gait therapy is statistically encoded by the system using Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) techniques.	Semantic Scholar
Later, the therapist's assistance is imitated by the robot, allowing the patient to continue practicing in the absence of the therapist.	Semantic Scholar
Preliminary experiments are performed with inexperienced users playing the role of the assisting therapist, and with healthy participants (wearing an elastic cord to simulate foot drop) playing the role of a patient.	Semantic Scholar
Toe clearance values are recorded, which show that the system is able to provide the full clearance needed by the patient to practice in the absence of the therapist.	Semantic Scholar
Modern networks are very large in size and also evolve with time.	Semantic Scholar
As their sizes grow, the complexity of performing network analysis grows as well.	Semantic Scholar
Getting a smaller representation of a temporal network with similar properties will help in various data mining tasks.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study the novel problem of getting a smaller diffusion-equivalent representation of a set of time-evolving networks.	Semantic Scholar
We first formulate a well-founded and general temporal-network condensation problem based on the so-called system-matrix of the network.	Semantic Scholar
We then propose NetCondense, a scalable and effective algorithm which solves this problem using careful transformations in sub-quadratic running time, and linear space complexities.	Semantic Scholar
Our extensive experiments show that we can reduce the size of large real temporal networks (from multiple domains such as social, co-authorship, and email) significantly without much loss of information.	Semantic Scholar
We also show the wide-applicability of NetCondense by leveraging it for several tasks: for example, we use it to understand, explore, and visualize the original datasets and to also speed-up algorithms for the influence-maximization and event detection problems on temporal networks.	Semantic Scholar
Apparent motion of the surroundings on an agent's retina can be used to navigate through cluttered environments, avoid collisions with obstacles, or track targets of interest.	Semantic Scholar
The pattern of apparent motion of objects, (i.e., the optic flow), contains spatial information about the surrounding environment.	Semantic Scholar
For a small, fast-moving agent, as used in search and rescue missions, it is crucial to estimate the distance to close-by objects to avoid collisions quickly.	Semantic Scholar
This estimation cannot be done by conventional methods, such as frame-based optic flow estimation, given the size, power, and latency constraints of the necessary hardware.	Semantic Scholar
A practical alternative makes use of event-based vision sensors.	Semantic Scholar
Contrary to the frame-based approach, they produce so-called events only when there are changes in the visual scene.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel asynchronous circuit, the spiking elementary motion detector (sEMD), composed of a single silicon neuron and synapse, to detect elementary motion from an event-based vision sensor.	Semantic Scholar
The sEMD encodes the time an object's image needs to travel across the retina into a burst of spikes.	Semantic Scholar
The number of spikes within the burst is proportional to the speed of events across the retina.	Semantic Scholar
A fast but imprecise estimate of the time-to-travel can already be obtained from the first two spikes of a burst and refined by subsequent interspike intervals.	Semantic Scholar
The latter encoding scheme is possible due to an adaptive nonlinear synaptic efficacy scaling.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the sEMD can be used to compute a collision avoidance direction in the context of robotic navigation in a cluttered outdoor environment and compared the collision avoidance direction to a frame-based algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed computational principle constitutes a generic spiking temporal correlation detector that can be applied to other sensory modalities (e.g., sound localization), and it provides a novel perspective to gating information in spiking neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
Future robots are expected to share the same workspace with humans and work in cooperation with them to improve productivity and maintain the quality of products.	Semantic Scholar
Considering this situation, we have developed a novel assembly task co-worker robot to support workers in their task by delivering the parts and tools to workers.	Semantic Scholar
Although such systems have improved work efficiency by predicting human's motion patterns, it is necessary to collect worker's data in advance and regenerate its model whenever the worker is changed.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we extend the previous system by installing an online learning algorithm and create a worker-dependent model without collecting data in advance.	Semantic Scholar
Trajectory prediction with high precision can be realized because of the worker-dependent model and effective utilization of the regularity of the worker's behavior.	Semantic Scholar
An adaptive task scheduling system based on the predicted result of the worker's behavior is proposed for improving work efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
Implementing the proposed algorithm, we evaluate the effectiveness of the task scheduling system by experiment.	Semantic Scholar
Compliant grasping systems offer a wide range of robot hand designs.	Semantic Scholar
Understanding the stability behavior of compliant grasps can enhance the reliability and security of such hands.	Semantic Scholar
A classical result in compliant grasp mechanics states that a stable multifinger grasp can suddenly lose its stability when the finger force magnitudes exceed a critical threshold determined by the grasp's geometry.	Semantic Scholar
This event is known as coin snapping.	Semantic Scholar
This paper provides a full analysis of the coin snapping phenomenon for planar grasps governed by linear compliance laws.	Semantic Scholar
The analysis leads to important insights concerning compliant grasp security.	Semantic Scholar
For instance, does a grasping system give warning signs before an object snaps out of the fingers’ grip?	Semantic Scholar
Is this an inevitable phenomenon in linearly compliant grasps?	Semantic Scholar
By systematically studying the bifurcation patterns of compliant multifinger grasps, this paper provides analytic characterization of the stability behavior of these systems, as well as answers to the mentioned questions under certain simplifying assumptions.	Semantic Scholar
Graphical examples and experimental measurements illustrate and validate the results.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present the design and the performance of a prototype bioinspired flapping-wing micro aerial vehicle with piezoelectric direct-driven actuation.	Semantic Scholar
This type of actuation is superior in terms of structural simplicity because it does not include any transmission mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
Instead, a unimorph piezoelectric actuator directly drives the wing.	Semantic Scholar
We designed and fabricated a two-wing prototype with a wingspan of 114 mm and successfully demonstrated takeoff using an external power source under a one-degree-of-freedom constraint.	Semantic Scholar
The total mass of the prototype was 598 mg, and the maximum measured lift force was 6.52 mN (665 mgf) at a driving voltage of 100 V. We achieved tethered flight using the proposed direct-driven piezoelectric actuator considering the constraint.	Semantic Scholar
Most existing multiview clustering methods require that graph matrices in different views are computed beforehand and that each graph is obtained independently.	Semantic Scholar
However, this requirement ignores the correlation between multiple views.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we tackle the problem of multiview clustering by jointly optimizing the graph matrix to make full use of the data correlation between views.	Semantic Scholar
With the interview correlation, a concept factorization–based multiview clustering method is developed for data integration, and the adaptive method correlates the affinity weights of all views.	Semantic Scholar
This method differs from nonnegative matrix factorization–based clustering methods in that it can be applicable to data sets containing negative values.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, normalized mutual information, and purity.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the difficulty of collecting labeled images for hundreds of thousands of visual categories, zero-shot learning, where unseen categories do not have any labeled images in training stage, has attracted more attention.	Semantic Scholar
In the past, many studies focused on transferring knowledge from seen to unseen categories by projecting all category labels into a semantic space.	Semantic Scholar
However, the label embeddings could not adequately express the semantics of categories.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the common semantics of seen and unseen instances cannot be captured accurately because the distribution of these instances may be quite different.	Semantic Scholar
For these issues, we propose a novel deep semisupervised method by jointly considering the heterogeneity gap between different modalities and the correlation among unimodal instances.	Semantic Scholar
This method replaces the original labels with the corresponding textual descriptions to better capture the category semantics.	Semantic Scholar
This method also overcomes the problem of distribution difference by minimizing the maximum mean discrepancy between seen and unseen instance distributions.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experimental results on two benchmark data sets, CU200-Birds and Oxford Flowers-102, indicate that our method achieves significant improvements over previous methods.	Semantic Scholar
A nonlinear inertial-aided image-based visual servo control approach for the stabilization of (almost) fully actuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
It makes use of the homography matrix between two images of a planar scene as feedback information while the system dynamics are exploited in a cascade manner in a control design: An outer-loop control defines a reference setpoint based on the homography matrix and an inner-loop control ensures the stabilization of the setpoint by assigning the thrust and torque controls.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike conventional solutions that only consider the system kinematics, the proposed control scheme is novel in considering the full system dynamics (incorporating all degrees of freedom, nonlinearities, and couplings, as well as interactions with the surrounding fluid) and in not requiring information of the relative depth and normal vector of the observed scene.	Semantic Scholar
Augmented with integral corrections, the proposed controller is robust with respect to model uncertainties and disturbances.	Semantic Scholar
The almost global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is demonstrated, which is the largest domain of attraction one can achieve by means of continuous feedback control.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation results illustrating these properties on a realistic AUV model subjected to a sea current are presented and finally experimental results on a real AUV are reported.	Semantic Scholar
Automated vehicles have received great attention, since they offer the possibility of significantly increasing traffic safety, mobility, and driver comfort.	Semantic Scholar
Current automation technology is still imperfect; therefore, there will still be situations in which the automation will not be able to handle and will request the driver to suspend nondriving tasks and take over control of the automated vehicle in a limited period of time.	Semantic Scholar
Accordingly, it is necessary to understand the effects of the lead time of take-over request as well as nondriving tasks on driver take-over.	Semantic Scholar
The present driving simulator experiment studied the effects of lead time and various realistic nondriving tasks on take-over behavior and driver acceptance to the automated vehicle.	Semantic Scholar
Results suggested optimal driver take-over performance when the lead time of the take-over request was 10–60 s for general nondriving tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, a take-over request with lead time at 10–60 s led to lower crash rate, greater minimum time-to-collision, and lower lateral acceleration.	Semantic Scholar
However, a longer lead time (e.g., 15–60 s) was necessary to achieve optimal driver acceptance even though drivers could successfully take over control with shorter lead time (e.g., 10 s).	Semantic Scholar
In addition, driver take over performance was significantly influenced by nondriving tasks.	Semantic Scholar
When more sensory modalities were occupied or when the cognitive load was very low, driver take-over performance was impaired, especially when the take-over request was too late (e.g., lead time was 3 s).	Semantic Scholar
Potential applications of the results in designing of take-over request in automated vehicles were further discussed.	Semantic Scholar
Cloud-based data-intensive applications have to process high volumes of transactional and analytical requests on large-scale data.	Semantic Scholar
Businesses base their decisions on the results of analytical requests, creating a need for real-time analytical processing.	Semantic Scholar
We propose Janus, a hybrid scalable cloud datastore, which enables the efficient execution of diverse workloads by storing data in different representations.	Semantic Scholar
Janus manages big datasets in the context of datacenters, thus supporting scaling out by partitioning the data across multiple servers.	Semantic Scholar
This requires Janus to efficiently support distributed transactions.	Semantic Scholar
In order to support the different datacenter requirements, Janus also allows diverse partitioning strategies for the different representations.	Semantic Scholar
Janus proposes a novel data movement pipeline to continuously ensure up to date data between the different representations.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike existing multi-representation storage systems and Change Data Capture (CDC) pipelines, the data movement pipeline in Janus supports partitioning and handles both distributed transactions and diverse partitioning strategies.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we focus on supporting Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) workloads, and hence use row and column-oriented representations, which are the most efficient representations for these workloads.	Semantic Scholar
Our evaluations over Amazon AWS illustrate that Janus can provide real-time analytical results, in addition to processing high-throughput transactional workloads.	Semantic Scholar
Contour is a critical feature for image description and object recognition in many computer vision tasks.	Semantic Scholar
However, detection of object contour remains a challenging problem because of disturbances from texture edges.	Semantic Scholar
This letter proposes a scheme to handle texture edges by implementing contour integration.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed scheme integrates structural segments into contours while inhibiting texture edges with the help of the orientation histogram-based center-surround interaction model.	Semantic Scholar
In the model, local edges within surroundings exert a modulatory effect on central contour cues based on the co-occurrence statistics of local edges described by the divergence of orientation histograms in the local region.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate the proposed scheme on two well-known challenging boundary detection data sets (RuG and BSDS500).	Semantic Scholar
The experiments demonstrate that our scheme achieves a high -measure of up to 0.74.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that our scheme achieves integrating accurate contour while eliminating most of texture edges, a novel approach to long-range feature analysis.	Semantic Scholar

This analysis showed a significant reduction in the resonance gain and frequency.	Semantic Scholar

Most community question answering (CQA) websites manage plenty of question-answer pairs (QAPs) through topic-based organizations, which may not satisfy users' fine-grained search demands.	Semantic Scholar
Facets of topics serve as a powerful tool to navigate, refine, and group the QAPs.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we propose FACM, a model to annotate QAPs with facets by extending convolution neural networks (CNNs) with a matching strategy.	Semantic Scholar
First, phrase information is incorporated into text representation by CNNs with different kernel sizes.	Semantic Scholar
Then, through a matching strategy among QAPs and facet label texts (FaLTs) acquired from Wikipedia, we generate similarity matrices to deal with the facet heterogeneity.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, a three-channel CNN is trained for facet label assignment of QAPs.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on three real-world data sets show that FACM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
Underactuated exoskeletons offer improved simplicity, affordability, and movement adjustability based on interaction forces, but in turn they suffer from lack of controllability.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose different rendering strategies to improve the controllability of underactuated devices, with no prior knowledge about the task to be performed.	Semantic Scholar
Since underactuated devices cannot achieve all desired poses or render all desired forces, the proposed strategies replace these desired values with proxy values that the devices can satisfy.	Semantic Scholar
Strategies in the force and operational spaces aim to minimize the error between the desired and the actual output force or pose, respectively, during operation.	Semantic Scholar
We test these strategies first using an underactuated hand exoskeleton during a virtual grasping task.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we compare them to each other and to other existing methods by analyzing their control performance during a trajectory tracking task.	Semantic Scholar

Articulated and flexible objects constitute a challenge for robot manipulation tasks, but are present in different real-world settings, including home and industrial environments.	Semantic Scholar
Current approaches to the manipulation of articulated and flexible objects employ ad hoc strategies to sequence and perform actions on them depending on a number of physical or geometrical characteristics related to those objects, as well as on an a priori classification of target object configurations.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose an action planning and execution framework, which (i) considers abstract representations of articulated or flexible objects, (ii) integrates action planning to reason upon such configurations and to sequence an appropriate set of actions with the aim of obtaining a target configuration provided as a goal, and (iii) is able to cooperate with humans to collaboratively carry out the plan.	Semantic Scholar
On the one hand, we show that a trade-off exists between the way articulated or flexible objects are perceived and how the system represents them.	Semantic Scholar
Such a trade-off greatly impacts on the complexity of the planning process.	Semantic Scholar
On the other hand, we demonstrate the system’s capabilities in allowing humans to interrupt robot action execution, and – in general – to contribute to the whole 1Corresponding author.	Semantic Scholar

When robotic manipulators perform high-level tasks in the presence of another agent, e.g., a human, they must have a strategy that considers possible interferences in order to guarantee task completion and efficient resource usage.	Semantic Scholar
One approach to generate such strategies is called reactive synthesis.	Semantic Scholar
Reactive synthesis requires an abstraction, which is a discrete structure that captures the domain in which the robot and other agents operate.	Semantic Scholar
Existing works discuss the construction of abstractions for mobile robots through space decomposition; however, they cannot be applied to manipulation domains due to the curse of dimensionality caused by the manipulator and the objects.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we present the first algorithm for automatic abstraction construction for reactive synthesis of manipulation tasks.	Semantic Scholar
We focus on tasks that involve picking and placing objects with possible extensions to other types of actions.	Semantic Scholar
The abstraction also provides an upper bound on path-based costs for robot actions.	Semantic Scholar
We combine this abstraction algorithm with our reactive synthesis planner to construct correct-by-construction plans.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the power of the framework on a UR5 robot, completing complex tasks in face of interferences by a human.	Semantic Scholar
We present a new algorithm for optimizing control policies for human-in-the-loop systems based on qualitative preference feedback.	Semantic Scholar
This method is especially applicable to systems such as lower limb prostheses and exoskeletons for which it is difficult to define an objective function, hard to identify a model, and costly to repeat hardware experiments.	Semantic Scholar
To solve these problems, we combine and extend an algorithm for learning from preferences and the Predictive Entropy Search Bayesian optimization method.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting algorithm, Predictive Entropy Search with Preferences (PES-P), solicits preferences between pairs of control parameter sets that optimally reduce the uncertainty in the distribution of objective function optima with the least number of experiments.	Semantic Scholar
We find that this algorithm outperforms the expected improvement method (EI), and random comparisons via Latin hypercubes (LH) in three simulation tests that range from optimizing randomly generated functions to tuning control parameters of linear systems and of a walking model.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we find in a pilot study on the control of a robotic transfemoral prosthesis that PES-P finds good control parameters quickly and more consistently than EI or LH given real user preferences.	Semantic Scholar
The results suggest the proposed algorithm can help engineers optimize certain robotic systems more accurately, efficiently, and consistently.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a new family of overhead traveling cranes based on variable radius drums (VRDs), called cable-based robotic cranes (CBRCs).	Semantic Scholar
A VRD is characterized by the variation of the spool radius along its profile.	Semantic Scholar
This kind of device is used, in this context, for the development of a cable-robot, which can support and move a load through a planar working area with just two degrees of freedom.	Semantic Scholar
First we present the kinematic analysis and the synthesis of the geometry of a VRD profile.	Semantic Scholar
Then, the schema of a bidimensional horizontal moving mechanism, based on the VRD theory, and an experimental prototype of a three-dimensional CBRC are presented.	Semantic Scholar
The features of this wire-based overhead crane and an analysis of cables tensions are discussed.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the performance of this mechanism is evaluated, demonstrating a deviation between the end-effector and the nominal planar surface of less than $1 \%$ throughout the whole working area.	Semantic Scholar

Hierarchical learning models, such as mixture models and Bayesian networks, are widely employed for unsupervised learning tasks, such as clustering analysis.	Semantic Scholar
They consist of observable and latent variables, which represent the given data and their underlying generation process, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
It has been pointed out that conventional statistical analysis is not applicable to these models, because redundancy of the latent variable produces singularities in the parameter space.	Semantic Scholar
In recent years, a method based on algebraic geometry has allowed us to analyze the accuracy of predicting observable variables when using Bayesian estimation.	Semantic Scholar
However, how to analyze latent variables has not been sufficiently studied, even though one of the main issues in unsupervised learning is to determine how accurately the latent variable is estimated.	Semantic Scholar
A previous study proposed a method that can be used when the range of the latent variable is redundant compared with the model generating data.	Semantic Scholar
The present paper extends that method to the situation in which the latent variables have redundant dimensions.	Semantic Scholar
We formulate new error functions and derive their asymptotic forms.	Semantic Scholar
Calculation of the error functions is demonstrated in two-layered Bayesian networks.	Semantic Scholar

We propose a novel graph structure called belief road map (BRM) that is built along with the searching process.	Semantic Scholar
The robot can efficiently query a path on the generated BRM instead of on the whole occupancy grid map.	Semantic Scholar
To reduce the belief states in the POMDP, the node in BRM that has the most information is selected to represent a room.	Semantic Scholar
The simulation and the real experimental studies demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our proposed searching approach.	Semantic Scholar

In this letter, we propose a three-dimensional (3-D) walking and skating motion generation method to achieve sequential walking and skating motion with skateboard and roller skate.	Semantic Scholar
For generating the sequential stable skating motion using a passive wheel, we must deal with non-coplanar contacts with anisotropic friction.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we use contact wrench cone (CWC) for considering complex contact states and introduce the novel terminal constraints using the CWC and divergent component of motion, which guarantee the stability of both walking and skating motion in the 3-D center of mass trajectory generation.	Semantic Scholar
Applying proposed method, the life-sized humanoid JAXON could successfully walk at 0.6 [m/s] and skate with skateboard and roller skate at 1.0 [m/s].	Semantic Scholar
Working memory requires information about external stimuli to be represented in the brain even after those stimuli go away.	Semantic Scholar
This information is encoded in the activities of neurons, and neural activities change over timescales of tens of milliseconds.	Semantic Scholar
Information in working memory, however, is retained for tens of seconds, suggesting the question of how time-varying neural activities maintain stable representations.	Semantic Scholar
Prior work shows that, if the neural dynamics are in the 'null space' of the representation - so that changes to neural activity do not affect the downstream read-out of stimulus information - then information can be retained for periods much longer than the time-scale of individual-neuronal activities.	Semantic Scholar
The prior work, however, requires precisely constructed synaptic connectivity matrices, without explaining how this would arise in a biological neural network.	Semantic Scholar
To identify mechanisms through which biological networks can self-organize to learn memory function, we derived biologically plausible synaptic plasticity rules that dynamically modify the connectivity matrix to enable information storing.	Semantic Scholar
Networks implementing this plasticity rule can successfully learn to form memory representations even if only 10% of the synapses are plastic, they are robust to synaptic noise, and they can represent information about multiple stimuli.	Semantic Scholar
Continuum robots have been attracting extensive attentions in the past few years due to their potential applications in minimally invasive surgery (MIS).	Semantic Scholar
Force sensing is critical in surgical applications which require palpation or deal with delicate structures.	Semantic Scholar
This letter addresses on the force sensing issue of surgery continuum robots.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a new force sensing method based on the shape reconstruction algorithm and the robot kinematic–static model.	Semantic Scholar
This method only requires the pose of the robot tip and the tensions of the driving cables.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments and simulations are carried out to validate the proposed force sensing method, and analyze the resolution and accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that both accuracy and resolution depend on the robot deflection angle.	Semantic Scholar
"For 24 groups of tests, where the robot deflection angles are within 95°, the average sensing error is 3.1% with a maximum value of 7.1%, and the average resolution is <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula> 0.19 g with a maximum value of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula> 0.57 g. Therefore, the proposed force sensing method is feasible to provide force information for MIS operations."	Semantic Scholar
Autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) have the potential to assist in real-life tasks involving grasping and transportation, but not before solving several difficult research challenges.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we address the design, control, estimation, and planning problems for cooperative localization, grasping, and transportation of objects in challenging outdoor scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate an autonomous team of MAVs able to plan safe trajectories for manipulation of ferrous objects, while guaranteeing interrobot collision avoidance and automatically creating a map of the objects in the environment.	Semantic Scholar
Our solution is predominantly distributed, allowing the team to pick and transport ferrous disks to a final destination without collisions.	Semantic Scholar
This result is achieved using a new magnetic gripper with a novel feedback approach, enabling the detection of successful grasping.	Semantic Scholar
The gripper design and all the components to build a platform are clearly provided as open-source hardware for reuse by the community.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the proposed solution is validated through experimental results, where difficulties include inconsistent wind, uneven terrain, and sandy conditions.	Semantic Scholar

In this paper, we present a solution for autonomous exploration and reconstruction in 3-D unknown environments without a priori knowledge of the environments.	Semantic Scholar
In our framework, a two-stage heuristic information gain-based next-view planning algorithm is performed to dynamically select and update candidate viewpoints, followed by immediate next-best-view extraction and corresponding motion planning.	Semantic Scholar
The two-stage planner consists of a frontier-based boundary coverage planner and a fixed start open travelling salesman problem solver, such that the planner returns an exploration path with the consideration of global optimality in the context of accumulated space information.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness of our work is evaluated with simulation and experimental tests.	Semantic Scholar
The results and comparisons prove our system is able to autonomously explore the 3-D unknown environments and reconstruct the structural model with improved exploration efficiency in terms of path quality and total exploration time.	Semantic Scholar
With a large body of literature dedicated to ego-motion estimation and perception of a robot's workspace, the robotics community has seen some impressive advances in self-localization and mapping, however, we are still far from general applicability of such approaches in real scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
Driven by the need for portable and low-cost solutions to relative pose estimation between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), in this letter, we propose a new framework to track a master UAV in real-time, carrying a known constellation of LED markers, from a slave UAV without any other pose estimation capability.	Semantic Scholar
This setup is especially interesting to aerial manipulation and close-up inspection of structures with low or no texture.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach is able to fuse the estimated master's pose with the slave's onboard inertial readings, supporting intermittent communication between the UAVs.	Semantic Scholar
Evaluation on both simulation and real indoor and outdoor experiments reveals that the proposed approach achieves unprecedented robustness to noise and occlusion, accuracy, and speed of computation.	Semantic Scholar
All the code to reproduce this work is publicly available.	Semantic Scholar
We present a study of spatio-temporal environment representations and exploration strategies for long-term deployment of mobile robots in real-world, dynamic environments.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a new concept for life-long mobile robot spatio-temporal exploration that aims at building, updating and maintaining the environment model during the long-term deployment.	Semantic Scholar
The addition of the temporal dimension to the explored space makes the exploration task a never-ending data-gathering process, which we address by application of information-theoretic exploration techniques to world representations that model the uncertainty of environment states as probabilistic functions of time.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate the performance of different exploration strategies and temporal models on real-world data gathered over the course of several months.	Semantic Scholar
The combination of dynamic environment representations with information-gain exploration principles allows to create and maintain up-todate models of continuously changing environments, enabling efficient and self-improving long-term operation of mobile robots.	Semantic Scholar
The determination of the singularity cases in visual servoing is a tricky problem, which is unsolved for most of the image-based approaches.	Semantic Scholar
In order to avoid singularities, redundant measurements may be used.	Semantic Scholar
However, they lead to the presence of local minima.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, they do not always ensure that singularities can be avoided.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we show that a concept named the “hidden robot,” which was formerly used for understanding the singularities of a vision-based controller dedicated to parallel robots, can be used for interpreting the singularities in the visual servoing of image points.	Semantic Scholar
These singularity cases were already found in the case in which three points are observed, but we show that the hidden robot concept considerably simplifies the analysis by using geometric interpretations of the mapping degeneracy and tools provided by the mechanical engineering community.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time, we provide the singularity conditions when more than three points are observed.	Semantic Scholar
We also discuss how these tools could be extended in order to find the singularity cases of other visual servoing techniques (e.g., when lines are observed).	Semantic Scholar

The field of computational cognitive neuroscience (CCN) builds and tests neurobiologically detailed computational models that account for both behavioral and neuroscience data.	Semantic Scholar
This article leverages a key advantage of CCN-namely, that it should be possible to interface different CCN models in a plug-and-play fashion-to produce a new and biologically detailed model of perceptual category learning.	Semantic Scholar
The new model was created from two existing CCN models: the HMAX model of visual object processing and the COVIS model of category learning.	Semantic Scholar
Using bitmap images as inputs and by adjusting only a couple of learning-rate parameters, the new HMAX/COVIS model provides impressively good fits to human category-learning data from two qualitatively different experiments that used different types of category structures and different types of visual stimuli.	Semantic Scholar
Overall, the model provides a comprehensive neural and behavioral account of basal ganglia-mediated learning.	Semantic Scholar
The power consumed by skid-steered mobile robots varies enormously depending on their operating regimes and environments.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, energy optimal planning of field missions can be accomplished only if the operating environment and an accurate model of the robot's power consumption are known in advance.	Semantic Scholar
This paper studies influences of location of the center of mass, surface type, terrain relief, platform geometry, radius of curvature, speed, and temperature on the power consumption of a skid-steered mobile platform and derives a physics-based power model that uses friction to accurately model the power consumed for the most relevant parameters inside a wide range of operating conditions.	Semantic Scholar
This paper also shows how friction can be measured using power consumed by the motors and how motor constants can be measured in a noninvasive end-to-end manner.	Semantic Scholar
Our findings were validated with a Clearpath's Husky A200 platform, driving it indoors and outdoors on different surfaces, varying the speed, the radius of curvature, the mass, and the center of mass location, resulting in a dense dataset on which the derived model as well as the temperature dependence of the power consumption was verified.

We present an autonomous manipulation approach for tissues with anisotropic deformation behavior using a continuum manipulator.	Semantic Scholar
The key feature of our vision-based study is an online learning and estimation method, which makes its implementation independent of any prior knowledge about the deformation behavior of the tissue and continuum manipulator as well as calibration of the vision system with respect to the robot.	Semantic Scholar
This important feature addresses the difficulty of using model-based control approaches in deformation control of a continuum manipulator manipulating an unknown deformable tissue.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluated the performance and robustness of our method in three different experiments using the da Vinci Research Kit coupled with a 5 mm instrument that has a 4-degree-of-freedom snake-like wrist.	Semantic Scholar
These experiments simulated situations that occur in various surgical schemes and verified the adaptability, learning capability, and accuracy of the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
This article examines the problem of visual area coverage by a network of Mobile Aerial Agents (MAAs).	Semantic Scholar
Each MAA is assumed to be equipped with a downwards facing camera with a conical field of view which covers all points within a circle on the ground.	Semantic Scholar
The diameter of that circle is proportional to the altitude of the MAA, whereas the quality of the covered area decreases with the altitude.	Semantic Scholar
A distributed control law that maximizes a joint coverage-quality criterion by adjusting the MAAs’ spatial coordinates is developed.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is evaluated through simulation studies.	Semantic Scholar

In this paper, we focus on large-scale environment monitoring by utilizing a fully decentralized team of mobile robots.	Semantic Scholar
The robots utilize the resource constrained-decentralized active sensing scheme to select the most informative (uncertain) locations to observe while conserving allocated resources (battery, travel distance, etc.).	Semantic Scholar
We utilize a distributed Gaussian process (GP) framework to split the computational load over our fleet of robots.	Semantic Scholar
Since each robot is individually generating a model of the environment, there may be conflicting predictions for test locations.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, in this paper, we propose an algorithm for aggregating individual prediction models into a single globally consistent model that can be used to infer the overall spatial dynamics of the environment.	Semantic Scholar
To make a prediction at a previously unobserved location, we propose a novel gating network for a mixture-of-experts model wherein the weight of an expert is determined by the responsibility of the expert over the unvisited location.	Semantic Scholar
The benefit of posing our problem as a centralized fusion with a distributed GP computation approach is that the robots never communicate with each other, individually optimize their own GP models based on their respective observations, and off-load all their learnt models on the base station only at the end of their respective mission times.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using publicly available datasets.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we present a multi-level and distributed control system, based on a robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) technique, for a multi-body slung-load system.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we consider a swarm of autonomous multi-copters which are connected by wires to a suspended payload.	Semantic Scholar
The payload reference trajectory is obtained through a constrained optimization, then the reference trajectory for each UAV is derived on the basis of the known shape of the formation, while taking into account operational constraints such as collision avoidance and cruise speed.	Semantic Scholar
Trajectory tracking is performed by a multilevel flight control system based on a MPC technique and a PID control system.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical simulations have been performed in order to test the control system in realistic scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the multicopters are modeled by the six Degrees-of-Freedom (6DOF) model, the constraint forces on the wires are calculated using the Udwadia–Kalaba equation and the external disturbances (atmospheric turbulence and gust) are included in the simulation.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation results are encouraging, thus making the proposed system an appealing candidate for similar applications.	Semantic Scholar

In this paper, we consider the problem of general topology control in multirobot systems with nonholonomic kinematics.	Semantic Scholar
Our contribution is twofold: We first demonstrate the correctness of topology control under the assumption that the network topology can switch arbitrarily and that potential-based mobility is discontinuous with respect to topology changes; we then demonstrate that a multirobot team under the above listed conditions continues to achieve topology control when actuator saturation is applied and in the presence of arbitrary discontinuous (and possibly nonpairwise) exogenous objectives.

Simulation results are given to corroborate our theoretical findings.	Semantic Scholar
Multi-agent systems (MAS) literature often assumes decentralized MAS to be especially suited for dynamic and large scale problems.	Semantic Scholar
In operational research, however, the prevailing paradigm is the use of centralized algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Present paper empirically evaluates whether a multi-agent system can outperform a centralized algorithm in dynamic and large scale logistics problems.	Semantic Scholar
This evaluation is novel in three aspects: (1) to ensure fairness both implementations are subject to the same constraints with respect to hardware resources and software limitations, (2) the implementations are systematically evaluated with varying problem properties, and (3) all code is open source, facilitating reproduction and extension of the experiments.	Semantic Scholar
Existing work lacks a systematic evaluation of centralized versus decentralized paradigms due to the absence of a real-time logistics simulator with support for both paradigms and a dataset of problem instances with varying properties.	Semantic Scholar
We extended an existing logistics simulator to be able to perform real-time experiments and we use a recent dataset of dynamic pickup-and-delivery problem with time windows instances with varying levels of dynamism, urgency, and scale.	Semantic Scholar
The OptaPlanner constraint satisfaction solver is used in a centralized way to compute a global schedule and used as part of a decentralized MAS based on the dynamic contract-net protocol (DynCNET) algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments show that the DynCNET MAS finds solutions with a relatively lower operating cost when a problem has all following three properties: medium to high dynamism, high urgency, and medium to large scale.	Semantic Scholar
In these circumstances, the centralized algorithm finds solutions with an average cost of 112.3% of the solutions found by the MAS.	Semantic Scholar
However, averaged over all scenario types, the average cost of the centralized algorithm is 94.2%.	Semantic Scholar
The results indicate that the MAS performs best on very urgent problems that are medium to large scale.	Semantic Scholar
This article presents the development of a power augmentation and rehabilitation exoskeleton based on a novel actuator.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed soft actuators are extensor bending pneumatic artificial muscles.	Semantic Scholar
This type of soft actuator is derived from extending McKibben artificial muscles by reinforcing one side to prevent extension.	Semantic Scholar
This research has experimentally assessed the performance of this new actuator and an output force mathematical model for it has been developed.	Semantic Scholar
This new mathematical model based on the geometrical parameters of the extensor bending pneumatic artificial muscle determines the output force as a function of the input pressure.	Semantic Scholar
This model is examined experimentally for different actuator sizes.	Semantic Scholar
After promising initial experimental results, further model enhancements were made to improve the model of the proposed actuator.	Semantic Scholar
To demonstrate the new bending actuators a power augmentation and rehabilitation soft glove has been developed.	Semantic Scholar
This soft hand exoskeleton is able to fit any adult hand size without the need for any mechanical system changes or calibration.	Semantic Scholar
EMG signals from the human hand have been monitored to prove the performance of this new design of soft exoskeleton.	Semantic Scholar
This power augmentation and rehabilitation wearable robot has been shown to reduce the amount of muscles effort needed to perform a number of simple grasps.	Semantic Scholar
The increasing popularity of social media has encouraged health consumers to share, explore, and validate health and wellness information on social networks, which provide a rich repository of Patient Generated Wellness Data (PGWD).	Semantic Scholar
While data-driven healthcare has attracted a lot of attention from academia and industry for improving care delivery through personalized healthcare, limited research has been done on harvesting and utilizing PGWD available on social networks.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, representation learning has been widely used in many applications to learn low-dimensional embedding of users.	Semantic Scholar
However, existing approaches for representation learning are not directly applicable to PGWD due to its domain nature as characterized by longitudinality, incompleteness, and sparsity of observed data as well as heterogeneity of the patient population.	Semantic Scholar
To tackle these problems, we propose an approach which directly learns the embedding from longitudinal data of users, instead of vector-based representation.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we simultaneously learn a low-dimensional latent space as well as the temporal evolution of users in the wellness space.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method takes into account two types of wellness prior knowledge: (1) temporal progression of wellness attributes; and (2) heterogeneity of wellness attributes in the patient population.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach scales well to large datasets using parallel stochastic gradient descent.	Semantic Scholar
We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our framework at tackling three major tasks in wellness domain: attribute prediction, success prediction, and community detection.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the ability of our approach in learning effective user representations.	Semantic Scholar
Cuing a location in space produces a short-lived advantage in reaction time to targets at that location.	Semantic Scholar
This early advantage, however, switches to a reaction time cost and has been termed inhibition of return (IOR).	Semantic Scholar
IOR behaves differently for different response modalities, suggesting that it may not be a unified effect.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents new data from two experiments testing the gradient of IOR with random, continuous cue-target Euclidean distance and cue-target onset asynchrony.	Semantic Scholar
These data were then used to train multiple diffusion models of saccadic and manual reaction time for these cuing experiments.	Semantic Scholar
Diffusion models can generate accurate distributions of reaction time data by modeling a response as a buildup of evidence toward a response threshold.	Semantic Scholar
If saccadic and attentional IOR are based on similar processes, then differences in distribution will be best explained by adjusting parameter values such as signal and noise within the same model structure.	Semantic Scholar
Although experimental data show differences in the timing of IOR across modality, best-fit models are shown to have similar model parameters for the gradient of IOR, suggesting similar underlying mechanisms for saccadic and manual IOR.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a new detection method to predict a vehicle's trajectory and use it for detecting lane changes of surrounding vehicles.	Semantic Scholar
According to the previous research, more than 90% of the car crashes are caused by human errors, and lane changes are the main factor.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, if a lane change can be detected before a vehicle crosses the centerline, accident rates will decrease.	Semantic Scholar
Previously reported detection methods have the problem of frequent false alarms caused by zigzag driving that can result in user distrust in driving safety support systems.	Semantic Scholar
Most cases of zigzag driving are caused by the abortion of a lane change due to the presence of adjacent vehicles on the next lane.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach reduces false alarms by considering the possibility of a crash with adjacent vehicles by applying trajectory prediction when the target vehicle attempts to change a lane, and it reflects the result of lane-change detection.	Semantic Scholar
We used a traffic dataset with more than 500 lane changes and confirmed that the proposed method can considerably improve the detection performance.	Semantic Scholar
Fast binary descriptors build the core for many vision based applications with real-time demands like object detection, Visual Odometry or SLAM.	Semantic Scholar
Commonly it is assumed, that the acquired images and thus the patches extracted around keypoints originate from a perspective projection ignoring image distortion or completely different types of projections such as omnidirectional or fisheye.	Semantic Scholar
Usually the deviations from a perfect perspective projection are corrected by undistortion.	Semantic Scholar
Latter, however, introduces severe artifacts if the cameras field-of-view gets larger.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a distorted and masked version of the BRIEF descriptor for calibrated cameras.	Semantic Scholar
Instead of correcting the distortion holistically, we distort the binary tests and thus adapt the descriptor to different image regions.	Semantic Scholar
The issue of missing values (MVs) has appeared widely in real-world datasets and hindered the use of many statistical or machine learning algorithms for data analytics due to their incompetence in handling incomplete datasets.	Semantic Scholar
To address this issue, several MV imputation algorithms have been developed.	Semantic Scholar
However, these approaches do not perform well when most of the incomplete tuples are clustered with each other, coined here as the  Clustered Missing Values Phenomenon, which attributes to the lack of sufficient complete tuples near an MV for imputation.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose the Order-Sensitive Imputation for Clustered Missing values (OSICM) framework, in which missing values are imputed sequentially such that the values filled earlier in the process are also used for later imputation of other MVs.	Semantic Scholar
Obviously, the order of imputations is critical to the effectiveness and efficiency of OSICM framework.	Semantic Scholar
We formulate the searching of the optimal imputation order as an optimization problem, and show its NP-hardness.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we devise an algorithm to find the exact optimal solution and propose two approximate/heuristic algorithms to trade off effectiveness for efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our OSICM framework.	Semantic Scholar
Homography estimation between multiple aerial images can provide relative pose estimation for collaborative autonomous exploration and monitoring.	Semantic Scholar
The usage on a robotic system requires a fast and robust homography estimation algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose an unsupervised learning algorithm that trains a deep convolutional neural network to estimate planar homographies.	Semantic Scholar
We compare the proposed algorithm to traditional-feature-based and direct methods, as well as a corresponding supervised learning algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Our empirical results demonstrate that compared to traditional approaches, the unsupervised algorithm achieves faster inference speed, while maintaining comparable or better accuracy and robustness to illumination variation.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, our unsupervised method has superior adaptability and performance compared to the corresponding supervised deep learning method.	Semantic Scholar

risk exposure.	Semantic Scholar
However, the readiness level of robots still prevents their effective exploitation in relief operations, which are highly critical and characterized by severe time constraints.	Semantic Scholar
On the contrary, current robotic technologies can be profitably applied in procedures like building assessment after an earthquake.	Semantic Scholar
To date, these operations are carried out by engineers and architects who inspect numerous buildings over a large territory, with a high cost in terms of time and resources, and with a high risk due to aftershocks.	Semantic Scholar
The main idea is to have the robot acting as an alter ego of the human operator, who, thanks to a virtual-reality device and a body-tracking system based on inertial sensors, teleoperates the robot.	Semantic Scholar

Although artificial neural networks have shown great promise in applications including computer vision and speech recognition, there remains considerable practical and theoretical difficulty in optimizing their parameters.	Semantic Scholar
The seemingly unreasonable success of gradient descent methods in minimizing these non-convex functions remains poorly understood.	Semantic Scholar
In this work we offer some theoretical guarantees for networks with piecewise affine activation functions, which have in recent years become the norm.	Semantic Scholar
We prove three main results.	Semantic Scholar
First, that the network is piecewise convex as a function of the input data.	Semantic Scholar
Second, that the network, considered as a function of the parameters in a single layer, all others held constant, is again piecewise convex.	Semantic Scholar
Third, that the network as a function of all its parameters is piecewise multi-convex, a generalization of biconvexity.	Semantic Scholar
From here we characterize the local minima and stationary points of the training objective, showing that they minimize the objective on certain subsets of the parameter space.	Semantic Scholar
We then analyze the performance of two optimization algorithms on multi-convex problems: gradient descent, and a method which repeatedly solves a number of convex sub-problems.	Semantic Scholar
We prove necessary convergence conditions for the first algorithm and both necessary and sufficient conditions for the second, after introducing regularization to the objective.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we remark on the remaining difficulty of the global optimization problem.	Semantic Scholar
Under the squared error objective, we show that by varying the training data, a single rectifier neuron admits local minima arbitrarily far apart, both in objective value and parameter space.	Semantic Scholar
Many real world complex systems naturally map to network data structures instead of geometric spaces because the only available information is the presence or absence of a link between two entities in the system.	Semantic Scholar
To enable data mining techniques to solve problems in the network domain, the nodes need to be mapped to a geometric space.	Semantic Scholar
We propose this mapping by representing each network node with its geodesic distances from all other nodes.	Semantic Scholar
The space spanned by the geodesic distance vectors is the geodesic space of that network.	Semantic Scholar
The position of different nodes in the geodesic space encode the network structure.	Semantic Scholar
In this space, considering a continuous density field induced by each node, density at a specific point is the summation of density fields induced by all nodes.	Semantic Scholar
We drift each node in the direction of positive density gradient using an iterative algorithm till each node reaches a local maximum.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the network structure captured by this space, the nodes that drift to the same region of space belong to the same communities in the original network.	Semantic Scholar
We use the direction of movement and final position of each node as important clues for community membership assignment.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed algorithm is compared with more than 10 state-of-the-art community detection techniques on two benchmark networks with known communities using Normalized Mutual Information criterion.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed algorithm outperformed these methods by a significant margin.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the proposed algorithm has also shown excellent performance on many real-world networks.	Semantic Scholar

By carefully injecting low values to a selected set of unrated user-item pairs in a user-item matrix, we demonstrate that top-<italic>N</italic> recommendation accuracies of various collaborative filtering (CF) techniques can be significantly and consistently improved.	Semantic Scholar
We first adopt the notion of <italic>pre-use preferences</italic> of users toward a vast amount of <italic>unrated</italic> items.	Semantic Scholar
Using this notion, we identify <italic>uninteresting</italic> items that have not been rated yet but are likely to receive low ratings from users, and selectively impute them as low values.	Semantic Scholar
As our proposed approach is method-agnostic, it can be easily applied to a variety of CF algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Through comprehensive experiments with three real-life datasets (e.g., Movielens, Ciao, and Watcha), we demonstrate that our solution consistently and universally enhances the accuracies of existing CF algorithms (e.g., item-based CF, SVD-based CF, and SVD++) by 2.5 to 5 times on average.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, our solution improves the running time of those CF methods by 1.2 to 2.3 times when its setting produces the best accuracy.	Semantic Scholar

Job-shop scheduling is an important problem in planning and operation of manufacturing systems.	Semantic Scholar
For such difficult problems to be solved daily within short amounts of time, the only practical goal is to obtain near-optimal solutions with quantifiable quality fast.	Semantic Scholar
Recent developments of powerful Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) methods such as branch-and-cut provide an opportunity for a fresh perspective at new effective MILP formulation and resolution of the problem.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, formulation tightening is critically important since if constraints directly delineate the convex hull of an MILP problem, it can be solved by linear programming without combinatorial difficulties.	Semantic Scholar
To achieve the above goal, three major contributions of this letter are: 1) to efficiently formulate the problem in an MILP form; 2) to develop a novel systematic formulation tightening approach for the first time; and 3) to establish a decomposition and coordination method with exponential reduction of complexity and accelerated convergence to efficiently solve the problem.	Semantic Scholar
Testing results show that our formulation tightening is effective in terms of computational efficiency and solution quality.	Semantic Scholar
With decomposition, time-consuming branching is no longer needed when solving subproblems, and coordination is effective.	Semantic Scholar
For dynamic job-shop scheduling problems, schedule can be regenerated fast based on previous scheduling results.	Semantic Scholar
This work opens up new directions for more exploration to efficiently solve MILP problems.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a method for checking and enforcing multicontact stability based on the zero-tilting moment point (ZMP).	Semantic Scholar
The key to our development is the generalization of ZMP support areas to take into account: 1) frictional constraints and 2) multiple noncoplanar contacts.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce and investigate two kinds of ZMP support areas.	Semantic Scholar
First, we characterize and provide a fast geometric construction for the support area generated by valid contact forces, with no other constraint on the robot motion.	Semantic Scholar
We call this set the full support area.	Semantic Scholar
Next, we consider the control of humanoid robots by using the linear pendulum mode (LPM).	Semantic Scholar
We observe that the constraints stemming from the LPM induce a shrinking of the support area, even for walking on horizontal floors.	Semantic Scholar
We propose an algorithm to compute the new area, which we call the pendular support area.	Semantic Scholar
We show that, in the LPM, having the ZMP in the pendular support area is a necessary and sufficient condition for contact stability.	Semantic Scholar
Based on these developments, we implement a whole-body controller and generate feasible multicontact motions where an HRP-4 humanoid locomotes in challenging multicontact scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
Finding an elementary form for an antiderivative is often a difficult task, so numerical integration has become a common tool when it comes to making sense of a definite integral.	Semantic Scholar
Some of the numerical integration methods can even be made rigorous: not only do they compute an approximation of the integral value but they also bound its inaccuracy.	Semantic Scholar
Yet numerical integration is still missing from the toolbox when performing formal proofs in analysis.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents an efficient method for automatically computing and proving bounds on some definite integrals inside the Coq formal system.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach is not based on traditional quadrature methods such as Newton–Cotes formulas.	Semantic Scholar
Instead, it relies on computing and evaluating antiderivatives of rigorous polynomial approximations, combined with an adaptive domain splitting.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach also handles improper integrals, provided that a factor of the integrand belongs to a catalog of identified integrable functions.	Semantic Scholar
This work has been integrated to the CoqInterval library.	Semantic Scholar
Graph Pattern Matching (GPM) has been used in lots of areas, like biology, medical science, and physics.	Semantic Scholar
With the advent of Online Social Networks (OSNs), recently, GPM has been playing a significant role in social network analysis, which has been widely used in, for example, finding experts, social community mining, and social position detection.	Semantic Scholar

In this paper, we first conceptually extend Bounded Simulation to <italic>Multi-Constrained Simulation (MCS)</italic>, and propose a novel NP-Complete Multi-Constrained Graph Pattern Matching (MC-GPM) problem.	Semantic Scholar
Then, to address the efficiency issue in large-scale MC-GPM, we propose a new concept called Strong Social Component (SSC), consisting of participants with strong social connections.	Semantic Scholar
We also propose an approach to identifying SSCs, and propose a novel index method and a graph compression method for SSC.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we devise a multithreading heuristic algorithm, called M-HAMC, to bidirectionally search the MC-GPM results in parallel without decompressing graphs.	Semantic Scholar
An extensive empirical study over five real-world large-scale social graphs has demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.	Semantic Scholar
Anxiety impairs evacuees' ability to select appropriate routes during building fire and smoke evacuations.	Semantic Scholar
Understanding anxiety is thus essential to provide proper guidance to evacuees.	Semantic Scholar
However, it is challenging to model how anxiety affects evacuees' decision-making process, and how to validate the resulting approach with very limited available data.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, mimicking anxiety in existing simulation packages is not easy because of the lack of appropriate features in simulators.	Semantic Scholar
This paper captures the impacts of anxiety on route choices and the interaction with other psychological features such as responses to guidance and herding.	Semantic Scholar
This is achieved by using an optimization framework where the number of planning steps and values of psychological parameters are affected by anxiety.	Semantic Scholar
To validate our approach, the levels of anxiety were manipulated by hazardous conditions and lengths of planning horizon are evaluated by comparing derived route choices against the data in virtual reality experiments.	Semantic Scholar
Impacts of anxiety on large crowds were also mimicked in Fire Dynamic Simulator + Evacuation with and without effective guidance.	Semantic Scholar
Testing results demonstrate that effective guidance help reduce negative impacts of anxiety on route choices.	Semantic Scholar
This letter focuses on finding robust paths for a robotic system by taking into account the state uncertainty and the probability of collision.	Semantic Scholar
We are interested in dealing with intermittent exteroceptive measurements (e.g., collected from vision).	Semantic Scholar
We assume that these cues provide reliable measurements that will update a state estimation algorithm wherever they are available.	Semantic Scholar
The planner has to manage two tasks: reaching the goal in a minimum time and collecting sufficient measurements to reach the goal state with a given confidence level.	Semantic Scholar
We present a robust perception-aware bi-directional A* planner for differentially flat systems such as a unicycle and a quadrotor UAV and use a derivative-free Kalman filter to approximate the belief dynamics in the flat space.	Semantic Scholar
We also propose an efficient way of ensuring continuity and feasibility by exploiting the convex-hull property of B-spline curves.	Semantic Scholar
In recent years, recommender system is one of indispensable components in many e-commerce websites.	Semantic Scholar
One of the major challenges that largely remains open is the cold-start problem, which can be viewed as a barrier that keeps the cold-start users/items away from the existing ones.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we aim to break through this barrier for cold-start users/items by the assistance of existing ones.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, inspired by the classic Elo Rating System, which has been widely adopted in chess tournaments, we propose a novel rating comparison strategy (RaPare ) to learn the latent profiles of cold-start users/items.	Semantic Scholar
The centerpiece of our RaPare is to provide a fine-grained calibration on the latent profiles of cold-start users/items by exploring the differences between cold-start and existing users/items.	Semantic Scholar
As a generic strategy, our proposed strategy can be instantiated into existing methods in recommender systems.	Semantic Scholar
To reveal the capability of RaPare strategy, we instantiate our strategy on two prevalent methods in recommender systems, i.e., the matrix factorization based and neighborhood based collaborative filtering.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental evaluations on five real data sets validate the superiority of our approach over the existing methods in cold-start scenario.	Semantic Scholar
The usability of telepresence applications is strongly affected by the communication delay between the user and the remote system.	Semantic Scholar
Special attention needs to be paid in case the distant scene is experienced by means of a Head Mounted Display.	Semantic Scholar
A high motion-to-photon latency, which describes the time needed to fully reflect the user's motion on the display, results in a poor feeling of presence.	Semantic Scholar
Further consequences involve unbearable motion sickness, indisposition, and termination of the telepresence session in the worst case.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present our low-cost MAVI telepresence system, which is equipped with a stereoscopic 360° vision system and high-payload manipulation capabilities.	Semantic Scholar
Special emphasis is placed on the stereoscopic vision system and its delay compensation.	Semantic Scholar
More specifically, we propose velocity-based dynamic field-of-view adaptation techniques to decrease the emergence of simulator sickness and to improve the achievable level of delay compensation.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed delay compensation approach relies on deep learning to predict the prospective head motion.	Semantic Scholar
We use our previously described head motion dataset for training, validation, and testing.	Semantic Scholar
To prove the general validity of our approach, we perform cross validation with another independent dataset.	Semantic Scholar
We use both qualitative measures and subjective experiments for evaluation.	Semantic Scholar
Our results show that the proposed approach is able to achieve mean compensation rates of around 99.9% for latencies between 0.1 and 0.5 s.	Semantic Scholar
Face recognition from image sets has numerous real-life applications including recognition from security and surveillance systems, multi-view camera networks and personal albums.	Semantic Scholar
An image set is an unordered collection of images (e.g., video frames, images acquired over long term observations and personal albums) which exhibits a wide range of appearance variations.	Semantic Scholar
The main focus of the previously developed methods has therefore been to find a suitable representation to optimally model these variations.	Semantic Scholar
This paper argues that such a representation could not necessarily encode all of the information contained in the set.	Semantic Scholar
The paper, therefore, suggests a different approach which does not resort to a single representation of an image set.	Semantic Scholar
Instead, the images of the set are retained in their original form and an efficient classification strategy is developed which extends well-known simple binary classifiers for the task of multi-class image set classification.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike existing binary to multi-class extension strategies, which require multiple binary classifiers to be trained over a large number of images, the proposed approach is efficient since it trains only few binary classifiers on very few images.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments and comparisons with existing methods show that the proposed approach achieves state of the art performance for image set classification based face and object recognition on a number of challenging datasets.	Semantic Scholar
More than thirty years after the initial concepts, commercial Delta and Delta-like robots serve a niche market for high-speed pick-and-place applications.	Semantic Scholar
Expired patents and new fields of application have led to increased research and innovative designs.	Semantic Scholar
By functionally extending the original translational Delta robot with additional serial chains, commercial concepts obtain up to three additional rotational degrees-of-freedom.	Semantic Scholar
In this context, the paper in hand is concerned with the analyses of serial-parallel Delta robots with full orientation capabilities.	Semantic Scholar
Based on efficient kinematic relations, an energy-related dynamic model is derived for four potential extensions.	Semantic Scholar
By solving the inverse dynamic problem, the influences of the additional serial chains on the actuation torques of the basic parallel Delta robot are analyzed.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the merits of each individual concept are evaluated using torque-related indices (i.e., energy consumption and root mean square torque) and discussed from a design point of view.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown that two types of extensions are predestined for industrial application.	Semantic Scholar
In these variants, the wrist motors are either attached to the frame or to the distal links.	Semantic Scholar
Stereo cameras are now commonly available on cars and mobile phones.	Semantic Scholar
However, the captured images may suffer from low image quality under noisy conditions, producing inaccurate disparity.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we aim at jointly restoring a clean image pair and estimating the corresponding disparity.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we propose a new joint framework that iteratively optimizes these two different tasks in a multiscale fashion.	Semantic Scholar
First, structure information between the stereo pair is utilized to denoise the images using a non-local means strategy.	Semantic Scholar
Second, a new noise-tolerant cost function is proposed for noisy stereo matching.	Semantic Scholar
These two terms are integrated into a multiscale framework in which cross-scale information is leveraged to further improve both denoising and stereo matching.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on datasets captured from indoor, outdoor, and low-light conditions show that the proposed method achieves superior performance than the state-of-the-art image denoising and disparity estimation methods.	Semantic Scholar
While it outperforms multi-image denoising methods by about 2 dB on average, it achieves a 50% error reduction over radiometric-change-robust stereo matching on the challenging KITTI dataset.	Semantic Scholar
The application of robotics to traditionally manual manufacturing processes requires careful coordination between human and robotic agents in order to support safe and efficient coordinated work.	Semantic Scholar
Tasks must be allocated to agents and sequenced according to temporal and spatial constraints.	Semantic Scholar
Also, systems must be capable of responding on-the-fly to disturbances and people working in close physical proximity to robots.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a centralized algorithm, named “Tercio,” that handles tightly intercoupled temporal and spatial constraints.	Semantic Scholar
Our key innovation is a fast, satisficing multi-agent task sequencer inspired by real-time processor scheduling techniques and adapted to leverage a hierarchical problem structure.	Semantic Scholar
We use this sequencer in conjunction with a mixed-integer linear program solver and empirically demonstrate the ability to generate near-optimal schedules for real-world problems an order of magnitude larger than those reported in prior art.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we demonstrate the use of our algorithm in a multirobot hardware testbed.	Semantic Scholar
We present improvements to Sherbrooke's multimodal autonomous drone (S-MAD), a microspine-based perching fixed-wing UAV that enables thrust-assisted climbing along vertical surfaces.	Semantic Scholar
Aircraft models are used to predict the performance of various aerial climb regimes and to design a controller for wall distance tracking.	Semantic Scholar
It is found that fast, long, and vertical climbs are favorable.	Semantic Scholar
Both short and long vertical autonomous climb maneuvers are demonstrated on rough surfaces (e.g., brick, roofing shingles).	Semantic Scholar
Results show that the S-MAD compares favorably with existing climbers, reaching a specific resistance of 19 with a much faster vertical speed (i.e., 2 m/s).	Semantic Scholar
A reduction in S-MAD's aerodynamic drag and an improved motor efficiency could bring its specific resistance down to 7, at a vertical speed of 5 m/s.	Semantic Scholar
Counting 3-, 4-, and 5-node graphlets in graphs is important for graph mining applications such as discovering abnormal/evolution patterns in social and biology networks.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, it is recently widely used for computing similarities between graphs and graph classification applications such as protein function prediction and malware detection.	Semantic Scholar
However, it is challenging to compute these graphlet counts for a large graph or a large set of graphs due to the combinatorial nature of the problem.	Semantic Scholar
Despite recent efforts in counting 3-node and 4-node graphlets, little attention has been paid to characterizing 5-node graphlets.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we develop a computationally efficient sampling method to estimate 5-node graphlet counts.	Semantic Scholar
We not only provide a fast sampling method and unbiased estimators of graphlet counts, but also derive simple yet exact formulas for the variances of the estimators which are of great value in practice—the variances can be used to bound the estimates’ errors and determine the smallest necessary sampling budget for a desired accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
We conduct experiments on a variety of real-world datasets, and the results show that our method is several orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art methods with the same accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
Querying heterogeneous and large-scale knowledge graphs is expensive.	Semantic Scholar
This paper studies a graph summarization framework to facilitate knowledge graph search.	Semantic Scholar
(1) We introduce a class of <italic>reduced summaries</italic>.	Semantic Scholar
Characterized by approximate graph pattern matching, these summaries are capable of summarizing entities in terms of their neighborhood similarity up to a certain hop, using small and informative graph patterns.	Semantic Scholar
(2) We study a <italic> diversified graph summarization</italic> problem.	Semantic Scholar
"Given a knowledge graph, it is to discover top-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""song-ieq1-2807442.gif""/> </alternatives></inline-formula> summaries that maximize a bi-criteria function, characterized by both informativeness and diversity."	Semantic Scholar
We show that diversified summarization is feasible for large graphs, by developing both sequential and parallel summarization algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
(a) We show that there exists a 2-approximation algorithm to discover diversified summaries.	Semantic Scholar
We further develop an anytime sequential algorithm which discovers summaries under resource constraints.	Semantic Scholar
(b) We present a new parallel algorithm with quality guarantees.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm is parallel scalable, which ensures its feasibility in distributed graphs.	Semantic Scholar
(3) We also develop a summary-based query evaluation scheme, which only refers to a small number of summaries.	Semantic Scholar
Using real-world knowledge graphs, we experimentally verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our summarization algorithms, and query processing using summaries.	Semantic Scholar
Compliant actuators enabling low-power stiffness adaptation are missing ingredients and key enablers of next generation robotic systems.	Semantic Scholar
One of the key components of these actuators is the mechanism implementing stiffness adaptation that requires sophisticated control and nontrivial mechanical design.	Semantic Scholar
However, despite recent advances in controlling these systems, their design remains experience based and not well understood.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present an optimization-based computational framework for the design of intrinsically low-power compliant variable stiffness mechanisms.	Semantic Scholar
The core ingredient of this framework is the mathematical formulation of the design problem—provided by a constrained nonlinear parameter optimization—which is computationally solved here to identify optimal variable stiffness designs.	Semantic Scholar
We show the basic capability of this formulation in finding parameters for variable stiffness mechanisms that require the least power by design.	Semantic Scholar
Further, we demonstrate the generality of this method in cross-comparing mechanisms with different kinematic topology to identify the one that requires the least power by design.	Semantic Scholar
A face hallucination algorithm is proposed to generate high-resolution images from JPEG compressed low-resolution inputs by decomposing a deblocked face image into structural regions such as facial components and non-structural regions like the background.	Semantic Scholar
For structural regions, landmarks are used to retrieve adequate high-resolution component exemplars in a large dataset based on the estimated head pose and illumination condition.	Semantic Scholar
For non-structural regions, an efficient generic super resolution algorithm is applied to generate high-resolution counterparts.	Semantic Scholar
Two sets of gradient maps extracted from these two regions are combined to guide an optimization process of generating the hallucination image.	Semantic Scholar
Numerous experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art hallucination methods on JPEG compressed face images with different poses, expressions, and illumination conditions.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a novel contouring error estimation based on the canonical approximation is proposed, which is applicable for three-dimensional contours.	Semantic Scholar
The approximation is derived from the Taylor expansion locally of the desired contour.	Semantic Scholar
It retains major geometric properties of a spatial curve, curvature and torsion.	Semantic Scholar
A systematic analysis and comparison is presented for the tangential approximation, the circular approximation, and the proposed canonical approximation.	Semantic Scholar
By transforming the identified dynamic model into local Frenet frame, contouring controllers are designed based on the estimated contouring errors using the three approximations.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments are conducted in a three-axis servo system for a cylindrical helix contour with different feed rates.	Semantic Scholar
The contouring error performance based on the proposed canonical approximation exhibits 70% and 36% improvement than those based on the tangential and the circular approximations, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a neural network model for solving random interval linear programming problems.	Semantic Scholar
The original problem involving random interval variable coefficients is first transformed into an equivalent convex second order cone programming problem.	Semantic Scholar
A neural network model is then constructed for solving the obtained convex second order cone problem.	Semantic Scholar
Employing Lyapunov function approach, it is also shown that the proposed neural network model is stable in the sense of Lyapunov and it is globally convergent to an exact satisfactory solution of the original problem.	Semantic Scholar
Several illustrative examples are solved in support of this technique.	Semantic Scholar
Geometric model fitting is a fundamental research topic in computer vision and it aims to fit and segment multiple-structure data.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a novel superpixel-guided two-view geometric model fitting method (called SDF), which can obtain reliable and consistent results for real images.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, SDF includes three main parts: a deterministic sampling algorithm, a model hypothesis updating strategy and a novel model selection algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed deterministic sampling algorithm generates a set of initial model hypotheses according to the prior information of superpixels.	Semantic Scholar
Then the proposed updating strategy further improves the quality of model hypotheses.	Semantic Scholar
After that, by analyzing the properties of the updated model hypotheses, the proposed model selection algorithm extends the conventional “fit-and-remove” framework to estimate model instances in multiple-structure data.	Semantic Scholar
The three parts are tightly coupled to boost the performance of SDF in both speed and accuracy, and SDF has the deterministic nature.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that the proposed SDF has significant advantages over several state-of-the-art fitting methods when it is applied to real images with single-structure and multiple-structure data.	Semantic Scholar
Human activity recognition techniques based on wearable inertial sensors have achieved great success, but the classification accuracy of human activities using wearable sensors is not good enough in practice.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a multisensor multiclassifier hierarchical fusion model based on entropy weight for human activity recognition using wearable inertial sensors is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
The fusion model has two layers, including basic-classifier fusion layer and sensor fusion layer.	Semantic Scholar
The entropy weight method has been applied to achieve the weight values that can affect the decision results of each layer.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, a novel feature selection method based on congruent transformation in matrix is also proposed.	Semantic Scholar
Three major experiments have been conducted to reveal the feasibility and availability of our algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments show that our fusion algorithm may achieve the better recognition performance when compared with basic classifiers and majority voting.	Semantic Scholar
For different feature dimensions, the performance of our algorithm is also better than that of majority voting, and the recognition accuracy rate may reach 96.72%.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the recognition accuracy rate of the proposed feature-selection method is about 96.96%, which is better than the other method.	Semantic Scholar
This paper describes a data-driven framework for approximate global optimization in which precomputed solutions to a sample of problems are retrieved and adapted during online use to solve novel problems.	Semantic Scholar
This approach has promise for real-time applications in robotics, since it can produce near globally optimal solutions orders of magnitude faster than standard methods.	Semantic Scholar
This paper establishes theoretical conditions on how many and where samples are needed over the space of problems to achieve a given approximation quality.	Semantic Scholar
The framework is applied to solve globally optimal collision-free inverse kinematics problems, wherein large solution databases are used to produce near-optimal solutions in a submillisecond time on a standard PC.	Semantic Scholar
This letter describes a system for autonomous spray painting using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), suitable for industrial applications.	Semantic Scholar
The work is motivated by the potential for such a system to achieve accurate and fast painting results.	Semantic Scholar
The PaintCopter is a quadrotor that has been custom fitted with an arm plus a spray gun on a pan-tilt mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
To enable long deployment times for industrial painting tasks, power and paint are delivered by lines from an external unit.	Semantic Scholar
The ability to paint planar surfaces, such as walls in single color, is a basic requirement for a spray painting system.	Semantic Scholar
But this work addresses more sophisticated operation that subsumes the basic task, including painting on three-dimensional (3D) structure, and painting of a desired texture appearance.	Semantic Scholar
System operation consists of (a) an offline component to capture a 3D model of the target surface, (b) an offline component to design the painted surface appearance and generate the associated robotic painting commands, and (c) a live system that carries out the spray painting.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results demonstrate autonomous spray painting by the UAV, doing area fill and versatile line painting on a 3D surface.	Semantic Scholar
In laparoscopic minimally invasive robotic surgery, a teleoperated robot is interposed between the patient and the surgeon.	Semantic Scholar
Despite the robot aid, the manipulation capabilities of surgical instruments are far from those of the human hand.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we want to make a step forward toward robotic solutions that can improve manipulation capabilities of the surgical instruments.	Semantic Scholar
A new concept of needle-driver tool is presented, which takes inspiration from the human hand model.	Semantic Scholar
The idea is to modify a standard laparoscopic tool by introducing an additional degree of freedom, which allows in-hand reorientation of the suturing needle.	Semantic Scholar
A 3D printed prototype has been built to validate the tool design.	Semantic Scholar
The improved manipulation capabilities have been assessed quantitatively by evaluating a weighted dexterity index along a single stitch trajectory.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, a comparison between our tool and a standard needle driver has been done in terms of time required for the execution of a complete suturing sequence.	Semantic Scholar
Recent advances in three-dimensional (3-D) printing are revolutionizing manufacturing, enabling the fabrication of structures with unprecedented complexity and functionality.	Semantic Scholar
Yet biological systems are able to fabricate systems with far greater complexity using a process that involves assembling and folding a linear string.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we demonstrate a 1-D printing system that uses an approach inspired by the ribosome to fabricate a variety of specialized robotic automata from a single string of source material.	Semantic Scholar
This proof-of-concept system involves both a novel manufacturing platform that configures the source material using folding and a computational optimization tool that allows designs to be produced from the specification of high-level goals.	Semantic Scholar
We show that our 1-D printing system is able to produce three distinct robots from the same source material, each of which is capable of accomplishing a specialized locomotion task.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we demonstrate the ability of the printer to use recycled material to produce new designs, enabling an autonomous manufacturing ecosystem capable of repurposing previous iterations to accomplish new tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Rank pooling is a temporal encoding method that summarizes the dynamics of a video sequence to a single vector which has shown good results in human action recognition in prior work.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we present novel temporal encoding methods for action and activity classification by extending the unsupervised rank pooling temporal encoding method in two ways.	Semantic Scholar
First, we present discriminative rank pooling in which the shared weights of our video representation and the parameters of the action classifiers are estimated jointly for a given training dataset of labelled vector sequences using a bilevel optimization formulation of the learning problem.	Semantic Scholar
When the frame level features vectors are obtained from a convolutional neural network (CNN), we rank pool the network activations and jointly estimate all parameters of the model, including CNN filters and fully-connected weights, in an end-to-end manner which we coined as end-to-end trainable rank pooled CNN.	Semantic Scholar
Importantly, this model can make use of any existing convolutional neural network architecture (e.g., AlexNet or VGG) without modification or introduction of additional parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we extend rank pooling to a high capacity video representation, called hierarchical rank pooling.	Semantic Scholar
Hierarchical rank pooling consists of a network of rank pooling functions, which encode temporal semantics over arbitrary long video clips based on rich frame level features.	Semantic Scholar
By stacking non-linear feature functions and temporal sub-sequence encoders one on top of the other, we build a high capacity encoding network of the dynamic behaviour of the video.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting video representation is a fixed-length feature vector describing the entire video clip that can be used as input to standard machine learning classifiers.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate our approach on the task of action and activity recognition.	Semantic Scholar
We present a detailed analysis of our approach against competing methods and explore variants such as hierarchy depth and choice of non-linear feature function.	Semantic Scholar
Obtained results are comparable to state-of-the-art methods on three important activity recognition benchmarks with classification performance of 76.7% mAP on Hollywood2, 69.4% on HMDB51, and 93.6% on UCF101.	Semantic Scholar
To prevent large interconnected power system from a cascading failure, brownout or even blackout, grid operators require access to faster than real-time information to make appropriate just-in-time control decisions.	Semantic Scholar
However, the communication and computational system limitations of currently used supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system can only deliver delayed information.	Semantic Scholar
However, the deployment of synchrophasor measurement devices makes it possible to capture and visualize, in near-real-time, grid operational data with extra granularity.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a cellular computational network (CCN) approach for frequency situational intelligence (FSI) in a power system is presented.	Semantic Scholar
The distributed and scalable computing unit of the CCN framework makes it particularly flexible for customization for a particular set of prediction requirements.	Semantic Scholar
Two soft-computing algorithms have been implemented in the CCN framework: a cellular generalized neuron network (CCGNN) and a cellular multi-layer perceptron network (CCMLPN), for purposes of providing multi-timescale frequency predictions, ranging from 16.67 ms to 2 s. These two developed CCGNN and CCMLPN systems were then implemented on two different scales of power systems, one of which installed a large photovoltaic plant.	Semantic Scholar
A real-time power system simulator at weather station within the Real-Time Power and Intelligent Systems (RTPIS) laboratory at Clemson, SC, was then used to derive typical FSI results.	Semantic Scholar
Real-world radiance values span several orders of magnitudes which have to be processed by artificial systems in order to capture visual scenes with a high visual sensitivity.	Semantic Scholar
Interestingly, it has been found that similar processing happens in biological systems, starting at the retina level.	Semantic Scholar
So our motivation in this paper is to develop a new video tone mapping operator (TMO) based on a synergistic model of the retina.	Semantic Scholar
We start from the so-called Virtual Retina model, which has been developed in computational neuroscience.	Semantic Scholar
We show how to enrich this model with new features to use it as a TMO, such as color management, luminance adaptation at photoreceptor level and readout from a heterogeneous population activity.	Semantic Scholar
Our method works for video but can also be applied to static images (by repeating images in time).	Semantic Scholar
It has been carefully evaluated on standard benchmarks in the static case, giving comparable results to the state-of-the-art using default parameters, while offering user control for finer tuning.	Semantic Scholar
Results on HDR videos are also promising, specifically w.r.t.	Semantic Scholar
temporal luminance coherency.	Semantic Scholar
As a whole, this paper shows a promising way to address computational photography challenges by exploiting the current research in neuroscience about retina processing.	Semantic Scholar
Spatial co-location pattern mining is an interesting and important task in spatial data mining which discovers the subsets of spatial features frequently observed together in nearby geographic space.	Semantic Scholar
However, the traditional framework of mining prevalent co-location patterns produces numerous redundant co-location patterns, which makes it hard for users to understand or apply.	Semantic Scholar
To address this issue, in this paper, we study the problem of reducing redundancy in a collection of prevalent co-location patterns by utilizing the spatial distribution information of co-location instances.	Semantic Scholar
"We first introduce the concept of <italic>semantic distance</italic> between a co-location pattern and its super-patterns, and then define redundant co-locations by introducing the concept of <italic> δ-covered</italic>, where <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\delta \,(0\leq \delta \leq 1)$</tex-math> <alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""wang-ieq1-2759110.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> is a coverage measure."	Semantic Scholar
We develop two algorithms <italic>RRclosed</italic> and <italic>RRnull</italic> to perform the redundancy reduction for prevalent co-location patterns.	Semantic Scholar
The former adopts the <italic>post-mining</italic> framework that is commonly used by existing redundancy reduction techniques, while the latter employs the <italic>mine-and-reduce </italic> framework that pushes redundancy reduction into the co-location mining process.	Semantic Scholar
Our performance studies on the synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that our method effectively reduces the size of the original collection of closed co-location patterns by about 50 percent.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the RRnull method runs much faster than the related closed co-location pattern mining algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present the design and development of a new robotic system for MRI-guided breast biopsy.	Semantic Scholar
The robot's structure is nonmagnetic, therefore, it can safely operate from within the scanner's magnetic bore; it has a compact Cartesian mechanism that allows it perform needle insertion tasks from both frontal and lateral directions inside an open bore scanner.	Semantic Scholar
A combination of piezoelectric and pneumatic actuators drive the motion of the proposed three degrees-of-freedom robot.	Semantic Scholar
To control the needle's insertion, we present an adaptive position regulator that uses the feedback from multiple sensors and that is robust to external disturbances.	Semantic Scholar
A detailed experimental study is presented to validate the performance and magnetic properties of the new mechanical prototype.	Semantic Scholar

Low-rank representation (LRR) has aroused much attention in the community of data mining.	Semantic Scholar
However, it has the following twoproblems which greatly limit its applications: (1) it cannot discover the intrinsic structure of data owing to the neglect of the local structure of data; (2) the obtained graph is not the optimal graph for clustering.	Semantic Scholar
To solve the above problems and improve the clustering performance, we propose a novel graph learning method named low-rank representation with adaptive graph regularization (LRR_AGR) in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
Firstly, a distance regularization term and a non-negative constraint are jointly integrated into the framework of LRR, which enables the method to simultaneously exploit the global and local information of data for graph learning.	Semantic Scholar
Secondly, a novel rank constraint is further introduced to the model, which encourages the learned graph to have very clear clustering structures, i.e., exactly c connected components for the data with c clusters.	Semantic Scholar
These two approaches are meaningful and beneficial to learn the optimal graph that discovers the intrinsic structure of data.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, an efficient iterative algorithm is provided to optimize the model.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed method can significantly improve the clustering performance.	Semantic Scholar
The high probability of hardware failures prevents many advanced robots (e.g., legged robots) from being confidently deployed in real-world situations (e.g., post-disaster rescue).	Semantic Scholar
Instead of attempting to diagnose the failures, robots could adapt by trial-and-error in order to be able to complete their tasks.	Semantic Scholar
In that case, damage recovery can be seen as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem.	Semantic Scholar
However, the best RL algorithms for robotics require resetting the robot and the environment to an initial state after each episode, that is, the robot is not learning autonomously.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, most of the RL methods for robotics do not scale well with complex robots (e.g., walking robots) and either cannot be used at all or take too long to converge to a solution (e.g., hours of learning).	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we introduce a novel learning algorithm called “Reset-free Trial-and-Error” (RTE) that (1) breaks the complexity by pre-generating hundreds of possible behaviors with a dynamics simulator of the intact robot, and (2) allows complex robots to quickly recover from damage while completing their tasks and taking the environment into account.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our algorithm on a simulated wheeled robot, a simulated six-legged robot, and a real six-legged walking robot that are damaged in several ways (e.g., a missing leg, a shortened leg, faulty motor, etc.)	Semantic Scholar
and whose objective is to reach a sequence of targets in an arena.	Semantic Scholar
Our experiments show that the robots can recover most of their locomotion abilities in an environment with obstacles, and without any human intervention.	Semantic Scholar
Overall, this new algorithm makes it possible to contemplate sending robots to places that are truly too dangerous for humans and from which robots cannot be rescued.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we prove that the dynamical model of a quadrotor subject to linear rotor drag effects is differentially flat in its position and heading.	Semantic Scholar
We use this property to compute feedforward control terms directly from a reference trajectory to be tracked.	Semantic Scholar
The obtained feedforward terms are then used in a cascaded, nonlinear feedback control law that enables accurate agile flight with quadrotors.	Semantic Scholar
Compared to the state-of-the-art control methods, which treat the rotor drag as an unknown disturbance, our method reduces the trajectory tracking error significantly.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we present a method based on a gradient-free optimization to identify the rotor drag coefficients, which are required to compute the feedforward control terms.	Semantic Scholar
The new theoretical results are thoroughly validated trough extensive comparative experiments.	Semantic Scholar
Co-design problems in the field of robotics involve the tradeoff of “resources” usage, such as cost, execution time, and energy, with mission performance, under recursive constraints that involve energetics, mechanics, computation, and communication.	Semantic Scholar
This letter shows that a large class of codesign problems have a common structure, as they are described by two posets, representing functionality, and resources.	Semantic Scholar
The codesign constraints can be expressed as two maps in opposite directions between the two posets.	Semantic Scholar
Finding the most resource-economical feasible solution is equivalent to finding the least fixed point of the composition of those two maps.	Semantic Scholar
If the two maps are monotone, results from order theory allow concluding uniqueness and systematically deriving an optimal design or a certificate for infeasibility.	Semantic Scholar
This paper describes the mechanical design and a cognition system for a novel concept-of-camera robotic assistant.	Semantic Scholar
The system combines the advantages of intra-abdominal devices and autonomous camera navigation.	Semantic Scholar
The robotic assistant is composed of a magnetic intra-abdominal camera robot with two internal cable-driven degrees of freedom and an external robot that handles an external magnet.	Semantic Scholar
The intelligence of the robot is implemented in a cognitive architecture based on a long-term memory that stores the robot's knowledge and learning capabilities to improve the robot's behavior.	Semantic Scholar
The navigation strategy combines a reactive control based on instrument tracking and a proactive control based on predefined behaviors, depending on the actual state of the task.	Semantic Scholar
The robot's learning capabilities include a semantic customization, to adapt the camera's behavior to the surgeon's preferences, and reinforcement learning, to improve the camera navigation strategy.	Semantic Scholar
This paper details both the hardware implementation of the system and the software implementation in a robotic operating system architecture.	Semantic Scholar
The cognition system and the performance of the cable-driven mechanism have been validated with a set of in vitro experiments.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the camera robot has been evaluated through an in-vivo experiment in a pig.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce a new query primitive called Function Query (FQ).	Semantic Scholar
An FQ operates on a set of math functions and retrieves the functions whose output with a given input satisfies a query condition (e.g., being among top k, within a given range).	Semantic Scholar
While FQ finds its natural uses in querying a database of math functions, it can also be applied on a database of discrete values.	Semantic Scholar
We show that by interpreting the database as a set of user-defined functions, FQ can achieve the same functionality as existing analytic queries such as top-k query and scalar product query.	Semantic Scholar
We address the challenge of efficient execution of FQ.	Semantic Scholar
The core of our solution is a novel data structure called Intersection-tree.	Semantic Scholar
Our research takes advantage of the fact that 1) the intersections of a set of continuous functions partition their domain into a number of subdomains, and 2) in each of these subdomains, the functions can be sorted based on their output.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate the performance of the proposed techniques through analysis, prototyping, and experiments using both synthetic and real-world data.	Semantic Scholar
When querying a database of functions, our techniques scale well.	Semantic Scholar
When applied on a database of discrete values, our techniques are more versatile and outperform existing techniques in terms of various performance metrics.	Semantic Scholar

Switched systems theory is used to analyze the stability of image-based observers for three-dimensional localization of objects in a scene in the presence of intermittent measurements due to occlusions, feature tracking losses, or a limited camera field of view, for example.	Semantic Scholar
Generally, observers or filters that are exponentially stable under persistent measurement availability may have unbounded error growth under intermittent measurement loss, even while providing seemingly accurate state estimates.	Semantic Scholar
By constructing a framework that utilizes a state predictor during periods when measurements are not available, a class of image-based observers is shown to be exponentially convergent in the presence of intermittent measurements if an average dwell time, and a total unmeasurability time, condition is satisfied.	Semantic Scholar
The conditions are developed in a general form, applicable to any observer that is exponentially convergent assuming persistent visibility, and utilizes object motion knowledge to reduce the amount of time measurements must be available to maintain convergence guarantees.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the stability results, simulations are provided to show improved performance compared to a zero-order hold approach, where state estimates are held constant when measurements are not available.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results are also included to verify the theoretical results, to demonstrate applicability of the developed observer and predictor design, and to compare against a typical approach using an extended Kalman filter.	Semantic Scholar
It is well known that auditory nerve (AN) fibers overcome bandwidth limitations through the volley principle, a form of multiplexing.	Semantic Scholar
What is less well known is that the volley principle introduces a degree of unpredictability into AN neural firing patterns that may be affecting even simple stimulus categorization learning.	Semantic Scholar
We use a physiologically grounded, unsupervised spiking neural network model of the auditory brain with spike time dependent plasticity learning to demonstrate that plastic auditory cortex is unable to learn even simple auditory object categories when exposed to the raw AN firing input without subcortical preprocessing.	Semantic Scholar
We then demonstrate the importance of nonplastic subcortical preprocessing within the cochlear nucleus and the inferior colliculus for stabilizing and denoising AN responses.	Semantic Scholar
Such preprocessing enables the plastic auditory cortex to learn efficient robust representations of the auditory object categories.	Semantic Scholar
The biological realism of our model makes it suitable for generating neurophysiologically testable hypotheses.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we introduce a robust and efficient algorithm, Predictive RANSAC, to fit and track a model in the presence of a large number of outlier measurements and heavy noise.	Semantic Scholar
Our algorithm works in two stages.	Semantic Scholar
In the model fitting stage, the algorithm first ranks the measurements from most likely to be inliers to least likely.	Semantic Scholar
It searches for the best model fit from the top-ranked to the lower-ranked measurements using a similar, but more effective, procedure to the RANSAC algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
In the model tracking stage, we use a Kalman filter to predict the location of the model and generate the confidence interval using the prediction error.	Semantic Scholar
To update the Kalman filter, the fitting process begins again with an initial guess using the Kalman filter prediction result and searches for inliers in the confidence interval.	Semantic Scholar
We also estimate the parameter of the Kalman filter such as noise covariance using the fitting algorithm and a Gaussian-Uniform mixture model.	Semantic Scholar
In this way, the two components work together to improve overall performance.	Semantic Scholar
To show the performance of the Predictive RANSAC algorithm, we compare our approach with previous algorithms based on RANSAC frameworks over several synthetic data sets and real world data sets, which include road mark fitting, homography estimation and multiple target tracking.	Semantic Scholar
The Predictive RANSAC algorithm shows better results in estimation accuracy, and consumes significantly less computational power.	Semantic Scholar
Recording and querying time-stamped trajectories incurs high cost of data storage and computing.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we explore several characteristics of the trajectories in road networks, which have motivated the idea of coding trajectories by associating timestamps with relative spatial path and locations.	Semantic Scholar
Such a representation contains a large number of duplicate information to achieve a lower entropy compared with the existing representations, thereby drastically cutting the storage cost.	Semantic Scholar
We propose several techniques to compress spatial path and locations separately, which can support fast positioning and achieve better compression ratio.	Semantic Scholar
For locations, we propose two novel encoding schemes such that the binary code can preserve distance information, which is very helpful for LBS applications.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, an unresolved question in this area is whether it is possible to perform a search directly on the compressed trajectories, and if the answer is yes, then how.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we show that directly querying compressed trajectories based on our encoding scheme is possible and can be done efficiently.	Semantic Scholar
We design a set of primitive operations for this purpose, and propose index structures to reduce query response time.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the advantage of our method and compare it against existing ones through a thorough experimental study on real trajectories in road network.	Semantic Scholar
The determination of the singularity cases in the observation of image features is a complicated problem, which is still open, apart from image points.	Semantic Scholar
For the first time, we provide the singularity cases in the observation of three image lines.	Semantic Scholar
We show that a concept named the “hidden robot,” which was formerly used for understanding the singularities of a vision-based controller dedicated to parallel robots and, more recently, which proved to be efficient for finding the singularity cases in the observation of image points, can be used for interpreting the singularities in the observation of three image lines.	Semantic Scholar
The hidden robot concept considerably simplifies the analysis by using geometric interpretations of the mapping degeneracy and tools provided by the mechanical engineering community.	Semantic Scholar
We prove that in the most complicated case where three general lines in space are observed, singularities appear when the origin of the observed object frame is either on a quadric or a cubic surface whose location in space depends on the configuration of the observed lines.	Semantic Scholar
In simpler cases where at least two lines belong to the same plane, these two surfaces can degenerate into simpler geometrical loci (e.g., planes, cylinders, and lines).	Semantic Scholar
Micro Aerial Vehicles (FOV) are very suitable for flying in indoor environments, but autonomous navigation is challenging due to their strict hardware limitations.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a highly efficient computer vision algorithm called Edge-FS for the determination of velocity and depth.	Semantic Scholar
It runs at 20 Hz on a 4 g stereo camera with an embedded STM32F4 microprocessor (168 MHz, 192 kB) and uses edge distributions to calculate optical flow and stereo disparity.	Semantic Scholar
The stereo-based distance estimates are used to scale the optical flow in order to retrieve the drone's velocity.	Semantic Scholar
The velocity and depth measurements are used for fully autonomous flight of a 40 g pocket drone only relying on on-board sensors.	Semantic Scholar
This method allows the MAV to control its velocity and avoid obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
Graph keyword search has drawn many research interests, since graph models can generally represent both structured and unstructured databases and keyword searches can extract valuable information for users without the knowledge of the underlying schema and query language.	Semantic Scholar
In practice, data graphs can be extremely large, e.g., a Web-scale graph containing billions of vertices.	Semantic Scholar
The state-of-the-art approaches employ centralized algorithms to process graph keyword searches, and thus they are infeasible for such large graphs, due to the limited computational power and storage space of a centralized server.	Semantic Scholar
To address this problem, we investigate keyword search for Web-scale graphs deployed in a distributed environment.	Semantic Scholar
We first give a naive search algorithm to answer the query efficiently.	Semantic Scholar
However, the naive search algorithm uses a flooding search strategy that incurs large time and network overhead.	Semantic Scholar
To remedy this shortcoming, we then propose a signature-based search algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we design a vertex signature that encodes the shortest-path distance from a vertex to any given keyword in the graph.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, we can find query answers by exploring fewer paths, so that the time and communication costs are low.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we reorganize the graph data in the cluster after its initial random partitioning so that the signature-based techniques are more effective.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed approach in performing keyword searches over Web-scale graph data.	Semantic Scholar
Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is the building block of Deep Belief Nets and other deep learning tools.	Semantic Scholar
Fast learning and prediction are both essential for practical usage of RBM-based machine learning techniques.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes Lean Contrastive Divergence (LCD), a modified Contrastive Divergence (CD) algorithm, to accelerate RBM learning and prediction without changing the results.	Semantic Scholar
LCD avoids most of the required computations with two optimization techniques.	Semantic Scholar
The first is called bounds-based filtering, which, through triangle inequality, replaces expensive calculations of many vector dot products with fast bounds calculations.	Semantic Scholar
The second is delta product, which effectively detects and avoids many repeated calculations in the core operation of RBM, Gibbs Sampling.	Semantic Scholar
The optimizations are applicable to both the standard contrastive divergence learning algorithm and its variations.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, this paper presents how to implement these optimizations effectively on massively parallel processors.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that the optimizations can produce several-fold (up to 3X for training and 5.3X for prediction) speedups.	Semantic Scholar
The paper presents and evaluates a distance-aware dynamic roadmap (DA-DRM) algorithm as an extension of the dynamic roadmap (DRM) approach.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to previous work, the algorithm is capable of planning collision-free trajectories while considering the distance to obstacles, even in unknown environments, which are perceived by the robot's depth camera system.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm makes use of a voxel distance grid, which is updated based on perceptual information acquired from the robot's perception system.	Semantic Scholar
The distance information is considered as a cost factor during the roadmap search and it is considered in a postprocessing step that is used for trajectory smoothing.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate the DA-DRM algorithm in simulation and in a real-world experiments with the humanoid robot ARMAR-III.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we compare our algorithm against the DRM and the RRT-Connect algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The results demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in terms of keeping a safety distance to obstacles, trajectory smoothness as well as the ability to generate solutions in narrow free space.	Semantic Scholar
Twitter, together with other online social networks, such as Facebook, and Gowalla have begun to collect hundreds of millions of check-ins.	Semantic Scholar
Check-in data captures the spatial and temporal information of user movements and interests.	Semantic Scholar
To model and analyze the spatio-temporal aspect of check-in data and discover temporal topics and regions, we first propose a spatio-temporal topic model, i.e., Upstream Spatio-Temporal Topic Model (USTTM).	Semantic Scholar
USTTM can discover temporal topics and regions, i.e., a user’s choice of region and topic is affected by time in this model.	Semantic Scholar
We use continuous time to model check-in data, rather than discretized time, avoiding the loss of information through discretization.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, USTTM captures the property that user’s interests and activity space will change over time, and users have different region and topic distributions at different times in USTTM.	Semantic Scholar
However, both USTTM and other related models capture “microscopic patterns” within a single city, where users share POIs, and cannot discover “macroscopic” patterns in a global area, where users check-in to different POIs.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we also propose a macroscopic spatio-temporal topic model, MSTTM, employing words of tweets that are shared between cities to learn the topics of user interests.	Semantic Scholar
We perform an experimental evaluation on Twitter and Gowalla data sets from New York City and on a Twitter US data set.	Semantic Scholar
In our qualitative analysis, we perform experiments with USTTM to discover temporal topics, e.g., how topic “tourist destinations” changes over time, and to demonstrate that MSTTM indeed discovers macroscopic, generic topics.	Semantic Scholar
In our quantitative analysis, we evaluate the effectiveness of USTTM in terms of perplexity, accuracy of POI recommendation, and accuracy of user and time prediction.	Semantic Scholar
Our results show that the proposed USTTM achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art models, confirming that it is more natural to model time as an upstream variable affecting the other variables.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the performance of the macroscopic model MSTTM is evaluated on a Twitter US dataset, demonstrating a substantial improvement of POI recommendation accuracy compared to the microscopic models.	Semantic Scholar
Much attention has been paid to the question of how Bayesian integration of information could be implemented by a simple neural mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
We show that population vectors based on point-process inputs combine evidence in a form that closely resembles Bayesian inference, with each input spike carrying information about the tuning of the input neuron.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that population vectors can combine information relatively accurately in the presence of noisy synaptic encoding of tuning curves.	Semantic Scholar
Locations, e.g., countries, states, cities, and point-of-interests, are central to news, emergency events, and people's daily lives.	Semantic Scholar
Automatic identification of locations associated with or mentioned in documents has been explored for decades.	Semantic Scholar
As one of the most popular online social network platforms, Twitter has attracted a large number of users who send millions of tweets on daily basis.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the world-wide coverage of its users and real-time freshness of tweets, location prediction on Twitter has gained significant attention in recent years.	Semantic Scholar
Research efforts are spent on dealing with new challenges and opportunities brought by the noisy, short, and context-rich nature of tweets.	Semantic Scholar
In this survey, we aim at offering an overall picture of location prediction on Twitter.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we concentrate on the prediction of user home locations, tweet locations, and mentioned locations.	Semantic Scholar
We first define the three tasks and review the evaluation metrics.	Semantic Scholar
By summarizing Twitter network, tweet content, and tweet context as potential inputs, we then structurally highlight how the problems depend on these inputs.	Semantic Scholar
Each dependency is illustrated by a comprehensive review of the corresponding strategies adopted in state-of-the-art approaches.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we also briefly review two related problems, i.e., semantic location prediction and point-of-interest recommendation.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we make a conclusion of the survey and list future research directions.	Semantic Scholar
Deep learning has received significant attention recently as a promising solution to many problems in the area of artificial intelligence.	Semantic Scholar
Among several deep learning architectures, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrate superior performance when compared to other machine learning methods in the applications of object detection and recognition.	Semantic Scholar
We use a CNN for image enhancement and the detection of driving lanes on motorways.	Semantic Scholar
In general, the process of lane detection consists of edge extraction and line detection.	Semantic Scholar
A CNN can be used to enhance the input images before lane detection by excluding noise and obstacles that are irrelevant to the edge detection result.	Semantic Scholar
However, training conventional CNNs requires considerable computation and a big dataset.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we suggest a new learning algorithm for CNNs using an extreme learning machine (ELM).	Semantic Scholar
The ELM is a fast learning method used to calculate network weights between output and hidden layers in a single iteration and thus, can dramatically reduce learning time while producing accurate results with minimal training data.	Semantic Scholar
A conventional ELM can be applied to networks with a single hidden layer; as such, we propose a stacked ELM architecture in the CNN framework.	Semantic Scholar
Further, we modify the backpropagation algorithm to find the targets of hidden layers and effectively learn network weights while maintaining performance.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results confirm that the proposed method is effective in reducing learning time and improving performance.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a new omnidirectional visual compass for a camera-robot, based on the phase correlation method in the two-dimensional Fourier domain.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed visual compass is accurate,  robust to image noise, and frugal in the use of computational resources.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, unlike the majority of existing ego-motion estimators, it does not rely on any geometric image primitive, and it only requires a minimal knowledge of the internal camera parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive real-world experiments conducted with a hypercatadioptric camera mounted on the end-effector of a Stäubli manipulator and on a Pioneer robot show the effectiveness of our approach.	Semantic Scholar
Although a lot of work has been performed in the gesture-based human–computer interface, blind users still feel it is difficult to interact with computers.	Semantic Scholar
One of the major stumbling blocks is the lack of knowledge about their preferences toward hand gestures.	Semantic Scholar
A user evaluation study is conducted with 25 blind users to understand this fact and an optimal gesture set is devised.	Semantic Scholar
These gestures are selected based on the performance and preference measure analysis.	Semantic Scholar
Performance measure includes rating of gestures on four subjective criteria: easiness , naturalness, learning, and reproducibility.	Semantic Scholar
In preference measure, a new parameter called as preference index is proposed in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
The optimal gestures are further categorized into two groups: tier-1 and tier-2.	Semantic Scholar
On the basis of these gestures, a dactylology is proposed for blind users so that they can interact with a computer easily.	Semantic Scholar
A prototype model of the proposed interactive system has been developed and encouraging experimental results are obtained.	Semantic Scholar

In a snapshot RANN query, the underlying data sets do not change and the results of a query are to be computed only once.	Semantic Scholar
In the continuous version, the users continuously change their locations and the results of RANN queries are to be continuously monitored.	Semantic Scholar
Based on effective pruning techniques and several non-trivial observations, we propose efficient RANN query processing algorithms for both the snapshot and continuous RANN queries.	Semantic Scholar
We conduct extensive experiments on both real and synthetic data sets and demonstrate that our algorithm for both snapshot and continuous queries are significantly better than the competitors.	Semantic Scholar

An optimization algorithm is developed in order to improve triangulation ability of the robot and thus enhance the arms’ collaborative operation.	Semantic Scholar
This a priori knowledge provides design directives in order to fulfill integration, reachability, and collaboration requirements.	Semantic Scholar
Further, automatic control is assigned to perform online safe collaboration tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Our initial exploration is validated with numerical simulations using robot designs based on the optimization algorithm output.	Semantic Scholar
The control algorithm—based on the relative Jacobian and Cosserat rod modeling—performs simultaneously with less than 1% of the total robot's length of accuracy for both relative end-effector distance control and trajectory tracking.	Semantic Scholar
Multi-agents systems are composed of autonomous and possibly heterogeneous software agents that act according to their own interests.	Semantic Scholar
Some coordination mechanism must be adopted to ensure a proper functioning of the whole system.	Semantic Scholar
Norms can be viewed as a powerful means to regulate and influence the behaviour of the agents by specifying, for instance, obligations, permissions, or prohibitions in a given context.	Semantic Scholar
A critical issue that must be considered in a system governed by multiple norms is the possible existence of normative conflicts.	Semantic Scholar
A conflict between norms is a situation in which the fulfilment of a norm causes a violation of another one.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present several techniques that have been proposed to detect and resolve normative conflicts in multi-agent systems.	Semantic Scholar
Our aim is to organize the literature, present a classification of the techniques found, and provide a means to compare alternative approaches dealing with normative conflicts.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, the synchronization of memristor-based neural networks with time-varying delays via pinning control is investigated.	Semantic Scholar
A novel pinning method is introduced to synchronize two memristor-based neural networks which denote drive system and response system, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
The dynamics are studied by theories of differential inclusions and nonsmooth analysis.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, some sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee asymptotic synchronization and exponential synchronization of memristor-based neural networks via the presented pinning control.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, some improvements about the proposed control method are also discussed in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the effectiveness of the obtained results is demonstrated by numerical simulations.	Semantic Scholar
Multiproduct systems are becoming more and more prevalent in modern manufacturing.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we introduce an application study of optimal control policy in a two-product door manufacturing line at an automotive assembly plant.	Semantic Scholar
In such a system, two types of doors for sedans and SUVs are produced and supplied to the sedan and SUV body shops, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
There is a nonnegligible setup time when the door type is changed.	Semantic Scholar
To study this system, a geometric machine reliability model is developed.	Semantic Scholar
Closed-form expressions of performance measures are derived and a sub-optimal control policy is presented to schedule product changeover so that maximal satisfaction to demands of both doors can be achieved.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the results are validated in door production.	Semantic Scholar
The increase of interest in using social media as a source for research has motivated tackling the challenge of automatically geolocating tweets, given the lack of explicit location information in the majority of tweets.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to much previous work that has focused on location classification of tweets restricted to a specific country, here we undertake the task in a broader context by classifying global tweets at the country level, which is so far unexplored in a real-time scenario.	Semantic Scholar
We analyze the extent to which a tweet’s country of origin can be determined by making use of eight tweet-inherent features for classification.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we use two datasets, collected a year apart from each other, to analyze the extent to which a model trained from historical tweets can still be leveraged for classification of new tweets.	Semantic Scholar
With classification experiments on all 217 countries in our datasets, as well as on the top 25 countries, we offer some insights into the best use of tweet-inherent features for an accurate country-level classification of tweets.	Semantic Scholar
We find that the use of a single feature, such as the use of tweet content alone-the most widely used feature in previous work-leaves much to be desired.	Semantic Scholar
Choosing an appropriate combination of both tweet content and metadata can actually lead to substantial improvements of between 20 and 50 percent.	Semantic Scholar
We observe that tweet content, the user’s self-reported location and the user’s real name, all of which are inherent in a tweet and available in a real-time scenario, are particularly useful to determine the country of origin.	Semantic Scholar
We also experiment on the applicability of a model trained on historical tweets to classify new tweets, finding that the choice of a particular combination of features whose utility does not fade over time can actually lead to comparable performance, avoiding the need to retrain.	Semantic Scholar
However, the difficulty of achieving accurate classification increases slightly for countries with multiple commonalities, especially for English and Spanish speaking countries.	Semantic Scholar
The twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome is a severe fetal anomaly appearing in up to 15% of identical twin pregnancies.	Semantic Scholar
This anomaly occurs when twins share blood vessels from a common placenta.	Semantic Scholar
The complication leads to an unbalanced blood transfusion between both fetuses.	Semantic Scholar
A current surgical treatment consists in coagulating the shared vessels using a fetoscope with an embedded laser.	Semantic Scholar
Such treatment is very delicate and constraining due to limited vision and size of the insertion area.	Semantic Scholar
The rigidity and lack of controllability of the current used instruments add an additional difficulty and limit the choice in insertion site.	Semantic Scholar
This letter proposes an improved flexible fetoscope, offering an enhanced laser controllability and higher versatility regarding the location of the insertion site.	Semantic Scholar
A better approach angle can therefore be realized.	Semantic Scholar
Also, tissue damage may be further reduced.	Semantic Scholar
This single-handed controllable active fetoscope is obtained after adaptation of a LithoVue (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA), a commercially available passive flexible ureteroscope.	Semantic Scholar
The LithoVue is fitted with a unique lightweight add-on actuation module foreseen of an artificial muscle and a dedicated control system.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments in a mixed reality trainer suggested that the proposed fetoscope is compact, ergonomic, and intuitive in use, allowing an adequate control of the flexible end.	Semantic Scholar

Contextual awareness in wearable computing allows for construction of intelligent systems, which are able to interact with the user in a more natural way.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study how personal locations arising from the user's daily activities can be recognized from egocentric videos.	Semantic Scholar
We assume that few training samples are available for learning purposes.	Semantic Scholar
Considering the diversity of the devices available on the market, we introduce a benchmark dataset containing egocentric videos of eight personal locations acquired by a user with four different wearable cameras.	Semantic Scholar
To make our analysis useful in real-world scenarios, we propose a method to reject negative locations, i.e., those not belonging to any of the categories of interest for the end-user.	Semantic Scholar
We assess the performances of the main state-of-the-art representations for scene and object classification on the considered task, as well as the influence of device-specific factors such as the field of view and the wearing modality.	Semantic Scholar

Collaborative privacy-preserving planning (CPPP) is a multi-agent planning task in which agents need to achieve a common set of goals without revealing certain private information.	Semantic Scholar
In many CPPP algorithms, the individual agents reason about a projection of the multi-agent problem onto a single-agent classical planning problem.	Semantic Scholar
For example, an agent can plan as if it controls the public actions of other agents, ignoring any private preconditions and effects theses actions may have, and use the cost of this plan as a heuristic estimate of the cost of the full, multi-agent plan.	Semantic Scholar
Using such a projection, however, ignores some dependencies between agents’ public actions.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, it does not contain dependencies between public actions of other agents caused by their private facts.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a projection in which these private dependencies are maintained.	Semantic Scholar
The benefit of our dependency-preserving projection is demonstrated by using it to produce high-level plans in a new privacy-preserving planner, and as a heuristic for guiding forward search privacy-preserving algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Both are able to solve more benchmark problems than any other state-of-the-art privacy-preserving planner.	Semantic Scholar
This more informed projection does not explicitly expose any private fact, action, or precondition.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we show that even if an adversary agent knows that an agent has some private objects of a given type (e.g., trucks), it cannot infer the number of such private objects that the agent controls.	Semantic Scholar
This introduces a novel form of strong privacy, which we call object-cardinality privacy, that is motivated by real-world requirements.	Semantic Scholar
Classic theories in nonlinear elasticity have increasingly been used to obtain accurate and efficient models for continuum robots and other elastic structures.	Semantic Scholar
Numerically computed solutions of these models typically satisfy the first-order conditions necessary for equilibrium, but do not provide any information about the elastic stability of the solution.	Semantic Scholar
The inability to detect or avoid physically unstable model solutions poses a major hindrance to reliable model-based simulation, planning, design, and control.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we adapt results from optimal control to determine the stability of Kirchhoff rods and Cosserat rods subject to general end constraints, including coupled multirod models which describe parallel continuum robots.	Semantic Scholar
We formulate a sufficient condition for the stability of a solution, a numerical test for evaluating this condition, and a heuristic stability metric.	Semantic Scholar
We verify that our numerical stability test agrees with the classical results for the buckling of single columns with various end constraints and for multicolumn frames.	Semantic Scholar
We then validate our approach experimentally on a six degree-of-freedom parallel continuum robot.	Semantic Scholar
Soft, underactuated, and compliant robotic exo-gloves have received an increased interest over the last decade.	Semantic Scholar
Possible applications of these systems range from augmenting the capabilities of healthy individuals to restoring the mobility of people that suffer from paralysis or stroke.	Semantic Scholar
Despite the significant progress in the field, most existing solutions are still heavy and expensive, they require an external power source to operate, and they are not wearable.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we focus on the development of adaptive (underactuated and compliant), tendon-driven, wearable exo-gloves and we propose two compact, affordable, and lightweight assistive devices that provide grasping capabilities enhancement to the user.	Semantic Scholar
The devices are experimentally tested and their efficiency is validated using three different types of tests: First, grasping tests that involve different everyday objects, second, force exertion capability tests that assess the fingertip forces that can be exerted while using the exo-gloves, and third, motion tracking experiments focusing on the finger bending profile.	Semantic Scholar
The devices are able to significantly enhance the grasping capabilities of their user with a weight of 335 g and a cost of $92 for the body powered version and a weight of 562 g and a cost of $369 for the motorized exo-glove version.	Semantic Scholar
Hand-held consumer depth cameras have become a commodity tool for constructing 3D models of indoor environments in real time.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, many methods to fuse low quality depth images into a single dense and high fidelity 3D model have been proposed.	Semantic Scholar
Nonetheless, dealing with large-scale scenes remains a challenging problem.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the accumulation of small errors due to imperfect camera localization becomes crucial (at large scale) and results in dramatic deformations of the built 3D model.	Semantic Scholar
These deformations have to be corrected whenever it is possible (when a loop exists for example).	Semantic Scholar
To facilitate such correction, we use a structured 3D representation where points are clustered into several planar patches that compose the scene.	Semantic Scholar
We then propose a two-stage framework to build in details and in real-time a large-scale 3D model.	Semantic Scholar
The first stage (the local mapping) generates local structured 3D models with rigidity constraints from short subsequences of RGB-D images.	Semantic Scholar
The second stage (the global mapping) aggregates all local 3D models into a single global model in a geometrically consistent manner.	Semantic Scholar
Minimizing deformations of the global model reduces to re-positioning the planar patches of the local models thanks to our structured 3D representation.	Semantic Scholar
This allows efficient, yet accurate computations.	Semantic Scholar
Our experiments using real data confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method.	Semantic Scholar

Haptic guidance is a promising way to support unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operators, but the design of haptic guidance forces is often heuristic.	Semantic Scholar
This paper describes the design and experimental validation of a systematic neuromuscular analysis-based tuning procedure for haptic guidance, here applied to haptic collision avoidance system for UAV teleoperation.	Semantic Scholar
This tuning procedure is hypothesized to reduce operator workload as compared with current heuristic tuning methods.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed procedure takes into consideration the estimated mechanical response of the neuromuscular system (NMS) to haptic cues.	Semantic Scholar
A “relax-task” setting of the NMS, for which reflexive and muscular activation is minimal, is chosen as the design point for tuning the haptic support, as this setting is expected to yield minimal physical workload.	Semantic Scholar
The paper first presents a neuromuscular identification experiment, performed to estimate the “relax task” admittance of an operator's arm.	Semantic Scholar
"The averaged admittance of a group of subjects (<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$n=10$</tex-math></inline-formula>) was then used for tuning the haptic shared controller, which was subsequently evaluated in its ability to support different operators ( <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$n=12$</tex-math></inline-formula>) in a simulated unmanned aerial vehicle surveillance task."	Semantic Scholar
Results show that our novel tuning procedure indeed reduces operator workload and also improves situation awareness compared with haptic settings that ignore the NMS.	Semantic Scholar
In fact, it is shown that overtuning, which frequently occurs for these heuristically tuned systems, leads to even lower user acceptance scores than interfaces without any haptic support.	Semantic Scholar
An accurate and efficient clothoid approximation approach is presented in this paper using Bézier curves based on the minimization of curvature profile difference.	Semantic Scholar
Compared with existing methods, the proposed approach is able to guarantee higher order geometric continuity with smaller approximation error in terms of position, orientation, and curvature.	Semantic Scholar
The approximation scheme takes place in three stages.	Semantic Scholar
First, a subset of clothoids with specific winding angle constraints referred to as elementary clothoids is approximated using quintic Bézier curves.	Semantic Scholar
Then, a basic clothoid defined in the first quadrant is formulated, which is composed of a series of transformed elementary clothoids.	Semantic Scholar
An adaptive sampling stra-tegy is applied to ensure that the resulting Bézier segments are computed within a specified accuracy and all the required information can be obtained offline and stored in a lookup table.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, a general clothoid with arbitrary parameters can be conveniently approximated based on the lookup table through appropriate geometric transformations.	Semantic Scholar
A comparison with the recent circular interpolation and rational Bézier curve based approximation shows that the proposed approach is able to achieve equivalent or greater computational efficiency in most scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
Every moment counts in action recognition.	Semantic Scholar
A comprehensive understanding of human activity in video requires labeling every frame according to the actions occurring, placing multiple labels densely over a video sequence.	Semantic Scholar
To study this problem we extend the existing THUMOS dataset and introduce MultiTHUMOS, a new dataset of dense labels over unconstrained internet videos.	Semantic Scholar
Modeling multiple, dense labels benefits from temporal relations within and across classes.	Semantic Scholar
We define a novel variant of long short-term memory deep networks for modeling these temporal relations via multiple input and output connections.	Semantic Scholar
We show that this model improves action labeling accuracy and further enables deeper understanding tasks ranging from structured retrieval to action prediction.	Semantic Scholar
While automated vehicle technology progresses, potentially leading to a safer and more efficient traffic environment, many challenges remain within the area of human factors, such as user trust for automated driving (AD) vehicle systems.	Semantic Scholar
The aim of this paper is to investigate how an appropriate level of user trust for AD vehicle systems can be created via human–machine interaction (HMI).	Semantic Scholar
A guiding framework for implementing trust-related factors into the HMI interface is presented.	Semantic Scholar
This trust-based framework incorporates usage phases, AD events, trust-affecting factors, and levels explaining each event from a trust perspective.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the research findings, the authors recommend that HMI designers and automated vehicle manufacturers take a more holistic perspective on trust rather than focusing on single, “isolated” events, for example understanding that trust formation is a dynamic process that starts long before a user's first contact with the system, and continues long thereafter.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, factors-affecting trust change, both during user interactions with the system and over time; thus, HMI concepts need to be able to adapt.	Semantic Scholar
Future work should be dedicated to understanding how trust-related factors interact, as well as validating and testing the trust-based framework.	Semantic Scholar

This problem has a wide range of applications, e.g., geospatial data integration, object detection, and motion estimation.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose an efficient progressive search solution that overcomes the drawbacks of existing solutions.	Semantic Scholar
First, we present a generic approach to build level-based lower bound functions on top of basic lower bound functions.	Semantic Scholar
Second, we develop a novel lower bound function for a group of sub-windows, in order to boost the efficiency of our solution.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we extend our solution to support irregular-shaped queries.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on real data demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed methods.	Semantic Scholar
A new parallel framework for fast computation of inverse and forward dynamics of articulated robots based on prefix sums (scans) is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
We first re-investigate the well-known recursive Newton–Euler formulation for robot dynamics and show that the forward–backward propagation process for robot inverse dynamics is equivalent to two scan operations on certain semigroups.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we showed that state-of-the-art forward dynamic algorithms can also be cast into a sequence of scan operations almost completely, with unscannable parts clearly identified.	Semantic Scholar
This suggests a serial–parallel hybrid approach for systems with a moderate number of links.	Semantic Scholar
We implement our scan-based algorithms on Nvidia CUDA platform with performance compared with multithreading CPU-based recursive algorithms; a computational acceleration is demonstrated.	Semantic Scholar
Persistent irregular activity is defined as elevated irregular neural discharges in the brain in such a way that while the average network activity displays high frequency oscillations, the participating neurons display irregular and low frequency oscillations.	Semantic Scholar
This type of activity is observed in many brain regions like prefrontal cortex that plays a role in working memory.	Semantic Scholar
Previous studies have shown that large networks with sparse connections, networks with strong noise and persistent inhibition and networks with structured synaptic connections display persistent-irregular activity.	Semantic Scholar
However, experimental studies show that, not all brain regions obey these assumptions.	Semantic Scholar
In this study we show that a small network of excitatory-inhibitory neurons with random synaptic connections can reproduce persistent-irregular activity.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the model shows that less than perfect rebound pattern in excitatory cells, coincident-sensitive inhibitory cells and sparse synaptic inhibition can account for persistent-irregular activity in an excitatory-inhibitory neural network with randomly assigned synaptic connections.	Semantic Scholar
This letter considers the problem of how robots in long-term space operations can learn to choose appropriate sources of assistance to recover from failures.	Semantic Scholar
Current assistant selection methods for failure handling are based on manually specified static lookup tables or policies, which are not responsive to dynamic environments or uncertainty in human performance.	Semantic Scholar
We describe a novel and highly flexible learning-based assistant selection framework that uses contextual multiarm bandit algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
The contextual bandits exploit information from observed environment and assistant performance variables to efficiently learn selection policies under a wide set of uncertain operating conditions and unknown/dynamically constrained assistant capabilities.	Semantic Scholar
Proof of concept simulations of long-term human–robot interactions for space exploration are used to compare the performance of the contextual bandit against other state-of-the-art assistant selection approaches.	Semantic Scholar
The contextual bandit outperforms conventional static policies and noncontextual learning approaches, and also demonstrates favorable robustness and scaling properties.	Semantic Scholar
unknown	Semantic Scholar
In a physical neural system, learning rules must be local both in space and time.	Semantic Scholar
In order for learning to occur, non-local information must be communicated to the deep synapses through a communication channel, the deep learning channel.	Semantic Scholar
We identify several possible architectures for this learning channel (Bidirectional, Conjoined, Twin, Distinct) and six symmetry challenges: (1) symmetry of architectures; (2) symmetry of weights; (3) symmetry of neurons; (4) symmetry of derivatives; (5) symmetry of processing; and (6) symmetry of learning rules.	Semantic Scholar
Random backpropagation (RBP) addresses the second and third symmetry, and some of its variations, such as skipped RBP (SRBP) address the first and the fourth symmetry.	Semantic Scholar
Here we address the last two desirable symmetries showing through simulations that they can be achieved and that the learning channel is particularly robust to symmetry variations.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, random backpropagation and its variations can be performed with the same non-linear neurons used in the main input-output forward channel, and the connections in the learning channel can be adapted using the same algorithm used in the forward channel, removing the need for any specialized hardware in the learning channel.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we provide mathematical results in simple cases showing that the learning equations in the forward and backward channels converge to fixed points, for almost any initial conditions.	Semantic Scholar
In symmetric architectures, if the weights in both channels are small at initialization, adaptation in both channels leads to weights that are essentially symmetric during and after learning.	Semantic Scholar
Biological connections are discussed.	Semantic Scholar
Least square regression is a very popular supervised classification method.	Semantic Scholar
However, two main issues greatly limit its performance.	Semantic Scholar
The first one is that it only focuses on fitting the input features to the corresponding output labels while ignoring the correlations among samples.	Semantic Scholar
The second one is that the used label matrix, i.e., zero-one label matrix is inappropriate for classification.	Semantic Scholar
To solve these problems and improve the performance, this paper presents a novel method, i.e., inter-class sparsity based discriminative least square regression (ICS_DLSR), for multi-class classification.	Semantic Scholar
Different from other methods, the proposed method pursues that the transformed samples have a common sparsity structure in each class.	Semantic Scholar
For this goal, an inter-class sparsity constraint is introduced to the least square regression model such that the margins of samples from the same class can be greatly reduced while those of samples from different classes can be enlarged.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, an error term with row-sparsity constraint is introduced to relax the strict zero-one label matrix, which allows the method to be more flexible in learning the discriminative transformation matrix.	Semantic Scholar
These factors encourage the method to learn a more compact and discriminative transformation for regression and thus has the potential to perform better than other methods.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the best performance in comparison with other methods for multi-class classification.	Semantic Scholar
This paper addresses the complete stability of delayed recurrent neural networks with Gaussian activation functions.	Semantic Scholar
By means of the geometrical properties of Gaussian function and algebraic properties of nonsingular M-matrix, some sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure that for an n-neuron neural network, there are exactly 3k equilibrium points with 0≤k≤n, among which 2k and 3k-2k equilibrium points are locally exponentially stable and unstable, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, it concludes that all the states converge to one of the equilibrium points; i.e., the neural networks are completely stable.	Semantic Scholar
The derived conditions herein can be easily tested.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the theoretical results.	Semantic Scholar
Much of ongoing robotic endoscope research is focused on locomotion, with only limited exploration into feedback control and autonomy in the unconventional and dynamic in vivo environment.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a modular endoscopy simulation apparatus (MESA) to quickly, affordably, and repeatedly test novel robotic endoscope control schemes in a synthetic colon at an accessible scale.	Semantic Scholar
The MESA allows for replication of many common physiologic barriers for current medical robotics, such as disturbances, patient positional changes, angulation of the colon, and a dynamic visual environment.	Semantic Scholar
The MESA will allow research teams to quickly and repeatedly validate new control strategies to minimize the effect of these physiological barriers before testing in costly in vivo  procedures.	Semantic Scholar
The MESA platform and synthetic colon described in this letter have shown successful replication of colon geometry, visual appearance, peristaltic wave speeds and pressures, and disturbances from patient movement.	Semantic Scholar
The mold for the synthetic colon was built in sections to allow for geometry changes for future molds and has shown marked similarity to in vivo images from colonoscopies.	Semantic Scholar
The actuators chosen for the various controllable stages have proven ample power to produce maximum-case disturbances expected during procedures, and the stages are modular in structure to allow for a variety of testing scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
Inflatable rubber tubes and electronic solenoid valves are used to produce contractile forces, and have shown excess capability to reproduce physiological motility.	Semantic Scholar
The simulator presented here will aid in future feedback control, localization, and autonomy development for robotic endoscopes.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents an agent-based model of the emergence and evolution of a language system for Boolean coordination.	Semantic Scholar
The model assumes the agents have cognitive capacities for invention, adoption, abstraction, repair and adaptation, a common lexicon for basic concepts, and the ability to construct complex concepts using recursive combinations of basic concepts and logical operations such as negation, conjunction or disjunction.	Semantic Scholar
It also supposes the agents initially have neither a lexicon for logical operations nor the ability to express logical combinations of basic concepts through language.	Semantic Scholar
The results of the experiments we have performed show that a language system for Boolean coordination emerges as a result of a process of self-organisation of the agents’ linguistic interactions when these agents adapt their preferences for vocabulary, syntactic categories and word order to those they observe are used more often by other agents.	Semantic Scholar
Such a language system allows the unambiguous communication of higher-order logic terms representing logical combinations of basic properties with non-trivial recursive structure, and it can be reliably transmitted across generations according to the results of our experiments.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the conceptual and linguistic systems, and simplification and repair operations of the agent-based model proposed are more general than those defined in previous works, because they not only allow the simulation of the emergence and evolution of a language system for the Boolean coordination of basic properties, but also for the Boolean coordination of higher-order logic terms of any Boolean type which can represent the meaning of nouns, sentences, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, prepositional phrases and subexpressions not traditionally analysed as forming constituents, using linguistic devices such as syntactic categories, word order and function words.

Big high dimensional data is becoming a challenging field of research.	Semantic Scholar
There exist a lot of techniques which infer information.	Semantic Scholar
However, because of the curse of dimensionality, a necessary step is the dimensionality reduction (DR) of the information.	Semantic Scholar
DR can be performed by linear and nonlinear algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
In general, linear algorithms are faster because of less computational burden.	Semantic Scholar
A related problem is dealing with time-varying high dimensional data, where the time dependence is due to nonstationary data distribution.	Semantic Scholar
Data stream algorithms are not able to project in lower dimensional spaces.	Semantic Scholar
Indeed, only linear projections, like principal component analysis (PCA), are used in real time while nonlinear techniques need the whole database (offline).	Semantic Scholar
The Growing Curvilinear Component Analysis (GCCA) neural network addresses this problem; it has a self-organized incremental architecture adapting to the changing data distribution and performs simultaneously the data quantization and projection by using CCA, a nonlinear distance-preserving reduction technique.	Semantic Scholar
"This is achieved by introducing the idea of ""seed"", pair of neurons which colonize the input domain, and ""bridge"", a novel kind of edge in the manifold graph, which signals the data non-stationarity."	Semantic Scholar
Some artificial examples and a real application are given, with a comparison with other existing techniques.	Semantic Scholar
A substantial effort is underway to make robots useful outside controlled environments and without direct human supervision.	Semantic Scholar
In practice, this can happen only after a rigorous certification process which ensures that several requirements, e.g., operation safety, are met.	Semantic Scholar
Automated verification of control programs can be part of cost-effective methodologies to support certification, but it is widely recognized as difficult to attain in robotics, because of several traits that characterize robot design and implementation.	Semantic Scholar
One such trait is the widespread usage of middleware to implement control programs in a distributed fashion.	Semantic Scholar
In these cases, the challenge of verification is made steep mainly by the fact that the correctness of control software depends on middleware components whose structured models might not be available, or too difficult to obtain from their documentation.	Semantic Scholar
Our proposal is to ease the application of automated verification techniques by identifying abstract middleware models in the form of finite-state automata.	Semantic Scholar
The identification procedure is itself largely automated, and the only prerequisite is for the middleware to be available for controlled experimentation.	Semantic Scholar
Once middleware models are computed, behaviors that would lead to unsafe operation can be spotted automatically on a composition of identified middleware and control software models using model checking techniques.	Semantic Scholar
The approach is based on our tool AIDE — Automata IDentification Engine — to identify abstract middleware models, and the model checker SPIN to verify control units.	Semantic Scholar
To validate our approach, we consider four different case studies built on YARP publishsubscribe middleware.	Semantic Scholar
Our results confirm that AIDE enables the extension of precise engineering methods to distributed control software in robotics.	Semantic Scholar

We present mixed-integer linear programming and constraint programming models, as well as new heuristic variants for the problem, comparing them to previously proposed heuristics.	Semantic Scholar
Our empirical work indicates that our heuristic variants improve on those from the literature, that constraint programming finds better solutions than the heuristics in run-times reasonable for the application, and that mixed-integer linear programming is superior for proving optimality.	Semantic Scholar
Given their performance and the appeal of the model-and-solve framework, we conclude that the proposed optimization methods are currently the most suitable for the graph-clear problem.	Semantic Scholar
Seismic surveying requires placing a large number of sensors (geophones) in a grid pattern, triggering a seismic event, and recording vibration readings.	Semantic Scholar
The goal of the surveying is often to locate subsurface resources.	Semantic Scholar
Traditional seismic surveying employs human laborers for sensor placement and retrieval.	Semantic Scholar
The major drawbacks of surveying with human deployment are the high costs and time, and risks to humans due to explosives, terrain, and climatic conditions.	Semantic Scholar

This paper provides detailed analysis and comparison with traditional survey techniques.	Semantic Scholar
Hardware experiments and simulations show promise for automation reducing cost and time.	Semantic Scholar
Autonomous aerial systems will have a substantial contribution to make in future seismic surveys.	Semantic Scholar
Organ retraction is a common and important task in minimally invasive surgery.	Semantic Scholar
It is a surgical technique to push aside or manipulate tissues/organs to improve the access and visualization of the surgical sites.	Semantic Scholar
Typical manual retractors are rigid and without any articulation.	Semantic Scholar
Physicians often struggle with minimizing the force applying onto the tissue while positioning the retractor to maintain optimal exposure.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a novel compliant robotic organ retractor with coupled tendon driven articulated wrist control to address the aforementioned clinical risks.	Semantic Scholar
The compliant retractor exploits the buckling principle of a continuum bending beam mechanism, allowing it to interact with organ safely and smoothly.	Semantic Scholar
We also present a new tendon-driven, high torsional strength articulated joint and corresponding kinematics model to address the lack of dexterity issue.	Semantic Scholar
For the instrument control, a general algorithm framework is proposed to design the controller gain systematically, while eliminating the “disturbance” leaking caused by the coupled multitendon driven mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
Initial prototypes were built and integrated with the state-of-the-art surgical robotic platform, da Vinci Research Kit for basic functional evaluation.	Semantic Scholar
Preliminary simulation and experimental results demonstrate the capability of the proposed device for organ retraction.	Semantic Scholar
It is our hope that this novel instrument will become a new benchmark for organ retraction in terms of safety, precision, and dexterity.	Semantic Scholar
Multi-label learning is the problem where each instance is associated with multiple labels simultaneously.	Semantic Scholar
Binary Relevance (BR) is a representative algorithm for multi-label learning.	Semantic Scholar
However, it may suffer the class-imbalance issue especially when the label space is large.	Semantic Scholar
Besides, it ignores the label correlations, which is of importance to improve the performance.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, labels might have positive and negative correlations in real applications, but existing methods seldom exploit the negative label correlations.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a novel Cost-sensitive multi-label learning model with Positive and Negative Label pairwise correlations (CPNL), which extends BR to tackle the above issues.	Semantic Scholar
The kernel extension of the linear model is also provided to explore complex input-output relationships.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we adopt two accelerated gradient methods (AGM) to efficiently solve the linear and kernel models.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that our approach CPNL achieves a competitive performance to some state-of-the-art approaches for multi-label learning.	Semantic Scholar
A novel control synthesis is proposed for humanoids to demonstrate unique foot-tilting behaviors that are comparable to humans in balance recovery.	Semantic Scholar
Our study of model-based behaviors explains the underlying mechanism and the significance of foot tilting well.	Semantic Scholar
Our main algorithms are composed of impedance control at the center of mass, virtual stoppers that prevent overtilting of the feet, and postural control for the torso.	Semantic Scholar
The proof of concept focuses on the sagittal scenario and the proposed control is effective to produce human-like balancing behaviors characterized by active foot tilting.	Semantic Scholar
The successful replication of this behavior on a real humanoid proves the feasibility of deliberately controlled underactuation.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental validation was rigorously performed, and the data from the submodules and the entire control were presented and analyzed.	Semantic Scholar

We describe a simple method to transfer from weights in deep neural networks (NNs) trained by a deep belief network (DBN) to weights in a backpropagation NN (BPNN) in the recursive-rule eXtraction (Re-RX) algorithm with J48graft (Re-RX with J48graft) and propose a new method to extract accurate and interpretable classification rules for rating category data sets.

In this letter, we propose an electromyography (EMG)-based optimal control framework to design physical human–robot interaction for rehabilitation and develop a novel assist-as-needed (AAN) controller based on a model predictive control (MPC) approach.	Semantic Scholar
To enhance the recovery of motor functions, encouraging the voluntary movements of patients is necessary while a therapist is assisting them.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, in an AAN control framework, the robot only assists the deficient torque to generate a target movement.	Semantic Scholar
In our study, we first estimate the joint torque of a patient from measured EMG signals and then derive the deficient joint torque to generate the target movements by considering the patient's estimated joint torque with an MPC method.	Semantic Scholar
Results showed that our proposed method adaptively derived the necessary torque to follow the target elbow joint trajectories based on the subject's voluntary movements.	Semantic Scholar
Most real systems consist of a large number of interacting, multi-typed components, while most contemporary researches model them as homogeneous information networks, without distinguishing different types of objects and links in the networks.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, more and more researchers begin to consider these interconnected, multi-typed data as heterogeneous information networks, and develop structural analysis approaches by leveraging the rich semantic meaning of structural types of objects and links in the networks.	Semantic Scholar
Compared to widely studied homogeneous information network, the heterogeneous information network contains richer structure and semantic information, which provides plenty of opportunities as well as a lot of challenges for data mining.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we provide a survey of heterogeneous information network analysis.	Semantic Scholar
We will introduce basic concepts of heterogeneous information network analysis, examine its developments on different data mining tasks, discuss some advanced topics, and point out some future research directions.	Semantic Scholar
The availability of grasp quality measures is fundamental for grasp planning and control, and also to drive designers in the definition and optimization of robotic hands.	Semantic Scholar
This work investigates on grasp robustness and quality indexes that can be applied to power grasps with underactuated and compliant hands.	Semantic Scholar
When dealing with such types of hands, there is the need of an evaluation method that takes into account the forces that can be actually controlled by the hand, depending on its actuation system.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study the potential contact robustness and the potential grasp robustness (PCR, PGR) indexes.	Semantic Scholar
They both consider main grasp properties: contact points, friction coefficient, etc., but also hand degrees of freedom and consequently, the directions of controllable contact forces.	Semantic Scholar
The PCR comes directly from the classical grasp theory and can be easily evaluated, but often leads to too conservative solutions, particularly when the grasp has many contacts.	Semantic Scholar
The PGR is more complex and computationally heavier, but gives a more realistic, even if still conservative, estimation of the overall grasp robustness, also in power grasps.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluated the indexes for various simulated grasps, performed with underactuated and compliant hands, and we analyzed their variations with respect to the main grasp parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Efficient processing of large-scale graphs in distributed environments has been an increasingly popular topic of research in recent years.	Semantic Scholar
Inter-connected data that can be modeled as graphs appear in application domains such as machine learning, recommendation, web search, and social network analysis.	Semantic Scholar
Writing distributed graph applications is inherently hard and requires programming models that can cover a diverse set of problems, including iterative refinement algorithms, graph transformations, graph aggregations, pattern matching, ego-network analysis, and graph traversals.	Semantic Scholar
Several high-level programming abstractions have been proposed and adopted by distributed graph processing systems and big data platforms.	Semantic Scholar
Even though significant work has been done to experimentally compare distributed graph processing frameworks, no qualitative study and comparison of graph programming abstractions has been conducted yet.	Semantic Scholar
In this survey, we review and analyze the most prevalent high-level programming models for distributed graph processing, in terms of their semantics and applicability.	Semantic Scholar
We review 34 distributed graph processing systems with respect to the graph processing models they implement and we survey applications that appear in recent distributed graph systems papers.	Semantic Scholar

The majority of the current approaches are based on candidate generation which necessitates parameter tuning, namely, definition of a neighborhood, an interest measure, and a threshold value to evaluate candidates.	Semantic Scholar
However, their performance is limited as the success of these methods relies heavily on parameter settings.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose an algorithm which uses a nonparametric stochastic de-clustering procedure and a multivariate Hawkes model to define triggering relations within and among the event types and employs the estimated model to extract significant triggering patterns of event types.	Semantic Scholar
We tested the proposed method with real and synthetic data sets exhibiting different characteristics.	Semantic Scholar
The method gives good results that are comparable with the methods based on candidate generation in the literature.	Semantic Scholar
We consider the problem where a team of mobile robots is tasked with collecting information about a set of stationary targets.	Semantic Scholar
There is a temporal deadline to complete the task, and the objective is to determine a control policy maximizing the probability of successfully completing the task within the assigned deadline.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, robots use imprecise sensors, and are subject to noisy dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, there are more targets than robots, so load sharing between robots is necessary.	Semantic Scholar
We model this problem using the theory of constrained Markov decision processes and split the solution into two steps.	Semantic Scholar
First, policies to observe small subsets of targets are computed, and the proposed model and algorithm allow one to extract accurate information characterizing the performance of the computed control policies.	Semantic Scholar
In the second stage, a subset of the computed policies is assigned to the robots for execution with the objective of maximizing a collective team performance function.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we introduce a submodular objective function and a greedy approximation algorithm to solve this nonlinear assignment problem.	Semantic Scholar
Simulations demonstrate how these models can be used in practice to appropriately tune the parameters characterizing this problem and show how the approach favorably scales with the complexity of the problem.	Semantic Scholar
Human activity detection from video that is recorded continuously over time has been gaining increasing attention due to its use in applications like security monitoring, smart homes and assisted living setups.	Semantic Scholar
The analysis of continuous videos for the detection of specific activities, called Activities of Interest (AoI) in this work, is particularly challenging, as the start and end times of the AoI are unknown, while the AoI themselves feature large anthropometric variations, making their recognition more difficult.	Semantic Scholar
Continuously recorded videos also contain periods of inactivity, or activities that are not in the set of AoI, further complicating the problem of detection.	Semantic Scholar
This work attempts to overcome these challenges by introducing the concepts of (1) discriminative descriptors, (2) a goal for the AoI, represented by the most discriminative descriptors, (3) a novel, goalbased framework for activity detection and recognition in video.	Semantic Scholar
We represent AoI goals by descriptors found to be the most discriminative, as defined by a function of their correlation distance from the majority of the data, rather than by semantics or parametric modeling.	Semantic Scholar
This ensures flexibility, as activities in video feature many variations which cannot always be adequately represented by model-based approaches.	Semantic Scholar
Temporal detection of AoI is based on the distance of the test data from the AoI goals, which is shown to provide accurate results.	Semantic Scholar
Activity recognition takes place by applying SVM classification on the detected AoI, and the results are compared with the state-of-the-art on publicly available real world and benchmark research datasets.	Semantic Scholar

The  first  IAS conference was held  in 1986 and was the  first conference on  this  topic.	Semantic Scholar
The Society,  founded  in 1994,  laid  the basis  for  the organization  of  the  IAS  conferences.	Semantic Scholar
The  topics  presented  at  the  successive  IAS conferences  showed  clearly  the  development  of  the  field  of  Intelligent  Autonomous Systems.	Semantic Scholar

In this paper, we present a unified approach for multi-robot cooperative simultaneous localization and object tracking based on particle filters.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach is scalable with respect to the number of robots in the team.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce a method that reduces, from an exponential to a linear growth, the space and computation time requirements with respect to the number of robots in order to maintain a given level of accuracy in the full-state estimation.	Semantic Scholar
Our method requires no increase in the number of particles with respect to the number of robots.	Semantic Scholar
However, in our method, each particle represents a full-state hypothesis, leading to the linear dependency on the number of robots of both space and time complexity.	Semantic Scholar
The derivation of the algorithm implementing our approach from a standard particle filter algorithm and its complexity analysis are presented.	Semantic Scholar
Through an extensive set of simulation experiments on a large number of randomized datasets, we demonstrate the correctness and efficacy of our approach.	Semantic Scholar
Through real robot experiments on a standardized open dataset of a team of four soccer-playing robots tracking a ball, we evaluate our method's estimation accuracy with respect to the ground truth values.	Semantic Scholar
Through comparisons with other methods based on 1) nonlinear least squares minimization and 2) joint extended Kalman filter, we further highlight our method's advantages.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we also present a robustness test for our approach by evaluating it under scenarios of communication and vision failure in teammate robots.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a trajectory generation approach using quadratic programming is described for aerial manipulation, i.e., for the control of an aerial vehicle equipped with a robot arm.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach applies the online active set strategy to generate a feasible trajectory of the joints, in order to accomplish a set of tasks with defined bounds and constraint inequalities.	Semantic Scholar
The definition of the problem in the acceleration domain allows to integrate and perform a large set of tasks and, as a result, to obtain smooth motion of the joints.	Semantic Scholar
A weighting strategy, associated with a normalization procedure, allows us to easily define the relative importance of the tasks.	Semantic Scholar
This approach is useful to accomplish different phases of a mission with different redundancy resolution strategies.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of the proposed technique is demonstrated through real experiments with all the algorithms running onboard in real time.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the aerial manipulator can successfully perform navigation and interaction phases, while keeping motion within prescribed bounds and avoiding collisions with external obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
Satisfaction prediction is one of the prime concerns in search performance evaluation.	Semantic Scholar
It is a non-trivial task for three major reasons: (1) The definition of satisfaction is subjective and different users may have different opinions in the process of satisfaction judgment.	Semantic Scholar
(2) Most existing studies on satisfaction prediction mainly rely on users’ click-through or query reformulation behaviors but there are many sessions without such interactions.	Semantic Scholar
(3) Most existing works primarily rely on the hypothesis that all results on search result pages (SERPs) are homogeneous, but a variety of heterogeneous search results have been aggregated into SERPs to improve the diversity and quality of search results recently.	Semantic Scholar
To shed light on these research questions, we construct an experimental search engine that could collect users’ satisfaction feedback as well as mouse click-through/movement data.	Semantic Scholar
Inspired by recent studies in predicting search result relevance based on mouse movement patterns (namely, motifs), we propose to estimate search satisfaction with motifs extracted from mouse movement data on SERPs.	Semantic Scholar
Besides the existing frequency-based motif selection method, two novel selection strategies (distance-based and distribution-based) are also adopted to extract high-quality motifs for satisfaction prediction.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that the proposed strategies outperform existing methods and have promising generalization capability for unseen users and queries in both a homogeneous and heterogeneous search environment.	Semantic Scholar
Given a set of multidimensional data points, skyline queries retrieve those points that are not dominated by any other points in the set.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the ubiquitous se of skyline queries, such as in preference-based query answering and decision making, and the large amount of data that these queries have to deal with, enabling their scalable processing is of critical importance.	Semantic Scholar
However, there are several outstanding challenges that have not been well addressed.	Semantic Scholar
More specifically, in this paper, we are tackling the data straggler and data skew challenges introduced by distributed skyline query processing, as well as the ensuing high computation cost of merging skyline candidates.	Semantic Scholar
We thus introduce a new efficient three-phase approach for large scale processing of skyline queries.	Semantic Scholar
In the first preprocessing phase, the data is partitioned along the Z-order curve.	Semantic Scholar
We utilize a novel data partitioning approach that formulates data partitioning as an optimization problem to minimize the size of intermediate data.	Semantic Scholar
In the second phase, each compute node partitions the input data points into disjoint subsets, and then performs the skyline computation on each subset to produce skyline candidates in parallel.	Semantic Scholar
In the final phase, we build an index and employ an efficient algorithm to merge the generated skyline candidates.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed skyline algorithm achieves more than one order of magnitude enhancement in performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.	Semantic Scholar
This work focuses on the problem of multi-label learning with missing labels (MLML), which aims to label each test instance with multiple class labels given training instances that have an incomplete/partial set of these labels (i.e., some of their labels are missing).	Semantic Scholar
The key point to handle missing labels is propagating the label information from the provided labels to missing labels, through a dependency graph that each label of each instance is treated as a node.	Semantic Scholar
We build this graph by utilizing different types of label dependencies.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, the instance-level similarity is served as undirected edges to connect the label nodes across different instances and the semantic label hierarchy is used as directed edges to connect different classes.	Semantic Scholar
This base graph is referred to as the mixed dependency graph, as it includes both undirected and directed edges.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we present another two types of label dependencies to connect the label nodes across different classes.	Semantic Scholar
One is the class co-occurrence, which is also encoded as undirected edges.	Semantic Scholar
Combining with the above base graph, we obtain a new mixed graph, called mixed graph with co-occurrence (MG-CO).	Semantic Scholar
The other is the sparse and low rank decomposition of the whole label matrix, to embed high-order dependencies over all labels.	Semantic Scholar
Combining with the base graph, the new mixed graph is called as MG-SL (mixed graph with sparse and low rank decomposition).	Semantic Scholar
Based on MG-CO and MG-SL, we further propose two convex transductive formulations of the MLML problem, denoted as MLMG-CO and MLMG-SL respectively.	Semantic Scholar
In both formulations, the instance-level similarity is embedded through a quadratic smoothness term, while the semantic label hierarchy is used as a linear constraint.	Semantic Scholar
In MLMG-CO, the class co-occurrence is also formulated as a quadratic smoothness term, while the sparse and low rank decomposition is incorporated into MLMG-SL, through two additional matrices (one is assumed as sparse, and the other is assumed as low rank) and an equivalence constraint between the summation of this two matrices and the original label matrix.	Semantic Scholar
Interestingly, two important applications, including image annotation and tag based image retrieval, can be jointly handled using our proposed methods.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our methods lead to significant improvements in performance and robustness to missing labels over the state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
We present <italic>smart drill-down</italic>, an operator for interactively exploring a relational table to discover and summarize “interesting” groups of tuples.	Semantic Scholar
Each group of tuples is described by a <italic>rule</italic> .	Semantic Scholar
"For instance, the rule <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$(a, b, \star, 1000)$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""joglekar-ieq1-2685998.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> tells us that there are 1,000 tuples with value <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$a$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""joglekar-ieq2-2685998.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> in the first column and <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$b$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""joglekar-ieq3-2685998.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> in the second column (and any value in the third column)."	Semantic Scholar
Smart drill-down presents an analyst with a list of rules that together describe interesting aspects of the table.	Semantic Scholar
The analyst can tailor the definition of interesting, and can interactively apply smart drill-down on an existing rule to explore that part of the table.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate that the underlying optimization problems are <sc>NP-Hard</sc>, and describe an algorithm for finding the approximately optimal list of rules to display when the user uses a smart drill-down, and a dynamic sampling scheme for efficiently interacting with large tables.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we perform experiments on real datasets on our experimental prototype to demonstrate the usefulness of smart drill-down and study the performance of our algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Social interactions are integral part of human behavior.	Semantic Scholar
Although social interactions are likely to possess unique behavioral patterns, their significance for automated user recognition has been noted in the scientific community only recently.	Semantic Scholar
This paper demonstrated that it is possible to generate a set of unique features, called social behavioral (SB) features, from the social interactions of individuals’ via an online social network (OSN).	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, this research identified a set of SB features from the online social interactions of 241 Twitter users and proposed a framework to utilize these features for an automated user recognition.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experimentation demonstrated high recognition performance as well as distinctiveness of the proposed SB features.	Semantic Scholar
The most striking finding was that only ten recent tweets are enough to recognize 58% of users in our database at rank-1.	Semantic Scholar
The rank-1 recognition rate dramatically increased to 93% when 60 tweets were used as a probe set.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results also demonstrated the stability of the proposed SB feature set over time and ability to recognize both frequent and nonfrequent OSN users.	Semantic Scholar
This confirms that human social behavior expressed through an OSN can provide a unique insight into user behavior recognition.	Semantic Scholar
We present a method that enables resilient formation control for mobile robot teams in the presence of noncooperative (defective or malicious) robots.	Semantic Scholar
Recent results in network science define graph topological properties that guarantee resilience against faults and attacks on individual nodes in static networks.	Semantic Scholar
We build on these results to propose a control policy that allows a team of mobile robots to achieve resilient consensus on the direction of motion.	Semantic Scholar
Our strategy relies on dynamic connectivity management that makes use of a metric that characterizes the robustness of the communication network topology.	Semantic Scholar
Our method distinguishes itself from prior work in that our connectivity management strategy ensures that the network lies above a critical resilience threshold, guaranteeing that the consensus algorithm always converges to a value within the range of the cooperative agents’ initial values.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the use of our framework for resilient flocking, and show simulation results with groups of holonomic mobile robots.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we research and evaluate end-to-end learning of monocular semantic-metric occupancy grid mapping from weak binocular ground truth.	Semantic Scholar
The network learns to predict four classes, as well as a camera to bird's eye view mapping.	Semantic Scholar
At the core, it utilizes a variational encoder–decoder network that encodes the front-view visual information of the driving scene and subsequently decodes it into a two-dimensional top-view Cartesian coordinate system.	Semantic Scholar
The evaluations on Cityscapes show that the end-to-end learning of semantic-metric occupancy grids outperforms the deterministic mapping approach with flat-plane assumption by more than 12% mean intersection-over-union.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we show that the variational sampling with a relatively small embedding vector brings robustness against vehicle dynamic perturbations, and generalizability for unseen KITTI data.	Semantic Scholar
Our network achieves real-time inference rates of approx.	Semantic Scholar
35 Hz for an input image with a resolution of 256 × 512 pixels and an output map with 64 × 64 occupancy grid cells using a Titan V GPU.	Semantic Scholar
We formulate a document summarization method to extract passage-level answers for non-factoid queries, referred to as answer-biased summaries.	Semantic Scholar
We propose to use external information from related Community Question Answering (CQA) content to better identify answer bearing sentences.	Semantic Scholar
Three optimization-based methods are proposed: (i) query-biased, (ii) CQA-answer-biased, and (iii) expanded-query-biased, where expansion terms were derived from related CQA content.	Semantic Scholar
A learning-to-rank-based method is also proposed that incorporates a feature extracted from related CQA content.	Semantic Scholar
Our results show that even if a CQA answer does not contain a perfect answer to a query, their content can be exploited to improve the extraction of answer-biased summaries from other corpora.	Semantic Scholar
The quality of CQA content is found to impact on the accuracy of optimization-based summaries, though medium quality answers enable the system to achieve a comparable (and in some cases superior) accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques.	Semantic Scholar
The learning-to-rank-based summaries, on the other hand, are not significantly influenced by CQA quality.	Semantic Scholar
We provide a recommendation of the best use of our proposed approaches in regard to the availability of different quality levels of related CQA content.	Semantic Scholar
As a further investigation, the reliability of our approaches was tested on another publicly available dataset.	Semantic Scholar
Hearing, vision, touch: underlying all of these senses is stimulus selectivity, a robust information processing operation in which cortical neurons respond more to some stimuli than to others.	Semantic Scholar
Previous models assume that these neurons receive the highest weighted input from an ensemble encoding the preferred stimulus, but dendrites enable other possibilities.	Semantic Scholar
Nonlinear dendritic processing can produce stimulus selectivity based on the spatial distribution of synapses, even if the total preferred stimulus weight does not exceed that of nonpreferred stimuli.	Semantic Scholar
Using a multi-subunit nonlinear model, we demonstrate that stimulus selectivity can arise from the spatial distribution of synapses.	Semantic Scholar
We propose this as a general mechanism for information processing by neurons possessing dendritic trees.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we show that this implementation of stimulus selectivity increases the neuron's robustness to synaptic and dendritic failure.	Semantic Scholar
Importantly, our model can maintain stimulus selectivity for a larger range of loss of synapses or dendrites than an equivalent linear model.	Semantic Scholar
We then use a layer 2/3 biophysical neuron model to show that our implementation is consistent with two recent experimental observations: (1) one can observe a mixture of selectivities in dendrites that can differ from the somatic selectivity, and (2) hyperpolarization can broaden somatic tuning without affecting dendritic tuning.	Semantic Scholar
Our model predicts that an initially nonselective neuron can become selective when depolarized.	Semantic Scholar
In addition to motivating new experiments, the model's increased robustness to synapses and dendrites loss provides a starting point for fault-resistant neuromorphic chip development.	Semantic Scholar
The use of reinforcement learning combined with neural networks provides a powerful framework for solving certain tasks in engineering and cognitive science.	Semantic Scholar
Previous research shows that neural networks have the power to automatically extract features and learn hierarchical decision rules.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we investigate reinforcement learning methods for performing a context-dependent association task using two kinds of neural network models (using continuous firing rate neurons), as well as a neural circuit gating model.	Semantic Scholar
The task allows examination of the ability of different models to extract hierarchical decision rules and generalize beyond the examples presented to the models in the training phase.	Semantic Scholar
We find that the simple neural circuit gating model, trained using response-based regulation of Hebbian associations, performs almost at the same level as a reinforcement learning algorithm combined with neural networks trained with more sophisticated back-propagation of error methods.	Semantic Scholar
A potential explanation is that hierarchical reasoning is the key to performance and the specific learning method is less important.	Semantic Scholar
In the original publication of the article, the reference 11 was omitted inadvertently.	Semantic Scholar
This paper designs a pattern classifier based on a Nonlinear AutoRegressive model with eXogenous inputs (NARX) to reveal intricate nonlinear dynamical correlation between mental workload (MWL) of a human operator and psychophysiological features.	Semantic Scholar
The salient electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram features were selected as inputs to the NARX model, whose continuous output was discretized in terms of five MWL classes at each time instant.	Semantic Scholar
The orders of the NARX model were determined using an objective function to achieve a good tradeoff between model accuracy and complexity via a least-squares support vector machine.	Semantic Scholar
The physiological features from different measurement channels (electrodes) and frequency bands were compared in terms of multiclass MWL classification performance.	Semantic Scholar
The classification results showed that the locality projection preservation technique can maintain sufficiently high MWL classification accuracy (with the highest five-class correct classification rate of 88%) with a significantly reduced computational complexity.	Semantic Scholar
The comparative results of classification performance also demonstrated the superiority of the proposed dynamic model to a widely-used static model.	Semantic Scholar
Entity linking is one of the problems to be handled in order to process natural language and to enrich the existing unstructured text with metadata.	Semantic Scholar
The generation of assignments between knowledge base entities and lexical units is called entity linking.	Semantic Scholar
Although a number of systems have been proposed for linking entity mentions in various languages, there is currently no publicly available entity linking system specific to the Turkish language.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a novel entity linking system—THINKER - for linking Turkish content with entities defined in the Turkish dictionary (tdk.gov.tr) or Turkish Wikipedia (tr.wikipedia.org).	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we first propose a novel machine learning based entity detection algorithm for the Turkish language.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we propose a collective disambiguation algorithm which utilizes a set of metrics for the linking task and, which is optimized using a genetic algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness of THINKER is validated empirically over generated data sets.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results show that THINKER outperformed the state-of-the-art cross-lingual and multilingual entity linking systems in the literature.	Semantic Scholar
High entity linking performance (74.81 percent F1 score) is achieved by extending previous methods with some features specific to Turkish language and by developing a novel method that can learn better representations of entity embeddings.	Semantic Scholar

To act upon the world, creatures must change continuous variables such as muscle length or chemical concentration.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast, decision making is an inherently discrete process, involving the selection among alternative courses of action.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we consider the interface between the discrete and continuous processes that translate our decisions into movement in a Newtonian world—and how movement informs our decisions.	Semantic Scholar
We do so by appealing to active inference, with a special focus on the oculomotor system.	Semantic Scholar
Within this exemplar system, we argue that the superior colliculus is well placed to act as a discrete-continuous interface.	Semantic Scholar
Interestingly, when the neuronal computations within the superior colliculus are formulated in terms of active inference, we find that many aspects of its neuroanatomy emerge from the computations it must perform in this role.	Semantic Scholar
The problem of non-iterative one-shot and non-destructive correction of unavoidable mistakes arises in all Artificial Intelligence applications in the real world.	Semantic Scholar
Its solution requires robust separation of samples with errors from samples where the system works properly.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate that in (moderately) high dimension this separation could be achieved with probability close to one by linear discriminants.	Semantic Scholar
Based on fundamental properties of measure concentration, we show that for M1-ϑ, where 1>ϑ>0 is a given small constant.	Semantic Scholar
Exact values of a,b>0 depend on the probability distribution that determines how the random M-element sets are drawn, and on the constant ϑ.	Semantic Scholar
These stochastic separation theorems provide a new instrument for the development, analysis, and assessment of machine learning methods and algorithms in high dimension.	Semantic Scholar
Theoretical statements are illustrated with numerical examples.	Semantic Scholar
Needle insertion is a minimally invasive medical procedure commonly used for biopsy, ablation, or deposition of therapeutic agents.	Semantic Scholar
In prostate brachytherapy, needles are inserted into the prostate in order to deposit multiple rice-grain-sized radioactive seeds to eradicate cancerous tissue from close proximity.	Semantic Scholar
During insertion, the needles should remain on a straight path, such that the seeds are deposited according to their preplanned location.	Semantic Scholar
The needles, however, due to their beveled tip, deflect from the straight path.	Semantic Scholar
In order to guide the needle back toward the straight path, the surgeon may manually rotate the needle axially or apply lateral force onto the needle near its entry point into tissue.	Semantic Scholar
To aid the surgeon with steering the needle more accurately toward the desired target, we propose robotic assistance where the responsibilities are assigned between the surgeon and the machine in such a way that safety is guaranteed while achieving high steering accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, in this work, a human-in-the-loop collaborative robotic assistant system is proposed where the aforementioned steering actions are carried out autonomously by the robotic assistant system.	Semantic Scholar
This collaboration modality is in agreement with safety requirements as the surgeon remains in the loop and is in charge of the most safety-critical task, which is the needle insertion itself.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown experimentally that using both steering commands from the machine as the surgeon inserts the needle satisfactorily achieves the goal of minimizing needle deflection with high accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
The problem of minimizing the transfer time along a given Cartesian path for redundant robots can be approached in two steps, by separating the generation of a joint path associated to the Cartesian path from the exact minimization of motion time under kinematic/dynamic bounds along the obtained parameterized joint path.	Semantic Scholar
In this framework, multiple suboptimal solutions can be found, depending on how redundancy is locally resolved in the joint space within the first step.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a solution method that works at the acceleration level, by using weighted pseudoinversion, optimizing an inertia-related criterion, and including null-space damping.	Semantic Scholar
Several numerical results obtained on different robot systems demonstrate consistently good behaviors and definitely faster motion times in comparison with related methods proposed in the literature.	Semantic Scholar
The motion time obtained with our method is reasonably close to the global time-optimal solution along same Cartesian path.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on a KUKA LWR IV are also reported, showing the tracking control performance on the executed motions.	Semantic Scholar
This paper addresses the design of a vision-based method to automatically deform soft objects into desired two-dimensional shapes with robot manipulators.	Semantic Scholar
The method presents an innovative feedback representation of the object's shape (based on a truncated Fourier series) and effectively exploits it to guide the soft object manipulation task.	Semantic Scholar
A new model calibration scheme that iteratively approximates a local deformation model from vision and motion sensory feedback is derived; this estimation method allows us to manipulate objects with unknown deformation properties.	Semantic Scholar
Pseudocode algorithms are presented to facilitate the implementation of the controller.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical simulations and experiments are reported to validate this new approach.	Semantic Scholar
Submarine control room operations have not changed much over the past 50 years, despite introduction of new technologies.	Semantic Scholar
This study sought to catalog current operations as a baseline for comparing new ways of working.	Semantic Scholar
Three scenarios were selected to be examined in both high and low demand: returning to periscope depth, dived tracking, and inshore operations.	Semantic Scholar
The scenarios were run in a submarine simulator with currently serving submariners from the Royal Navy.	Semantic Scholar
The flow of throughout the submarine command team was examined using event analysis for systemic teamwork (EAST).	Semantic Scholar
EAST models collaborative teamwork via three networks: task, social, and information.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that the social interactions, information transition, and focus of tasks are different depending on the particular operation being completed and the work demand placed on the command team.	Semantic Scholar
There are particular information elements that are fundamental across all scenario types.	Semantic Scholar
Task and communication load is not evenly distributed across the team, with potential bottlenecks identified between the sonar controller and operations officer roles.	Semantic Scholar
Implications of the results are discussed alongside recommendations for future research.	Semantic Scholar
The recent developments of soft robots have inspired a variety of applications that require compliance for safety and softness for biomimetics.	Semantic Scholar
With such prevalence and advantages of soft robots, researchers are diverting their interests toward applications like micromanipulation of biological tissue.	Semantic Scholar
However, the progress has been thwarted by the difficulty in producing soft robots in miniature scale.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a new kind of microscale soft pneumatic actuators (SPA) made from streamlined and standardized fabrication procedure with customizable bending modalities inspired by shape engineering.	Semantic Scholar
Preliminary mathematical models are given to interpret width-based shape engineering for customization and to compare the bending angle and radius of curvature measured from the characterization experiments.	Semantic Scholar
The fabricated SPA was tested on the sciatic nerve of a rat in order to show its future potentials in biomedical field.	Semantic Scholar
Ultimately, this paper will contribute to the diversification of SPA fabrication and customization, as well as biomedical applications that demand smaller dimensions and higher precision.	Semantic Scholar
Event cameras are bioinspired vision sensors that output pixel-level brightness changes instead of standard intensity frames.	Semantic Scholar
These cameras do not suffer from motion blur and have a very high dynamic range, which enables them to provide reliable visual information during high-speed motions or in scenes characterized by high dynamic range.	Semantic Scholar
However, event cameras output only little information when the amount of motion is limited, such as in the case of almost still motion.	Semantic Scholar
Conversely, standard cameras provide instant and rich information about the environment most of the time (in low-speed and good lighting scenarios), but they fail severely in case of fast motions, or difficult lighting such as high dynamic range or low light scenes.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present the first state estimation pipeline that leverages the complementary advantages of these two sensors by fusing in a tightly coupled manner events, standard frames, and inertial measurements.	Semantic Scholar
We show on the publicly available Event Camera Dataset that our hybrid pipeline leads to an accuracy improvement of 130% over event-only pipelines, and 85% over standard-frames-only visual-inertial systems, while still being computationally tractable.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we use our pipeline to demonstrate—to the best of our knowledge—the first autonomous quadrotor flight using an event camera for state estimation, unlocking flight scenarios that were not reachable with traditional visual-inertial odometry, such as low-light environments and high dynamic range scenes.

One part of demonstrating that a device is acceptably safe, often required by regulatory standards, is to show that it satisfies a set of requirements known to mitigate hazards.	Semantic Scholar
This paper is concerned with how to demonstrate that a user interface software design is compliant with use-related safety requirements.	Semantic Scholar
A methodology is presented based on the use of formal methods technologies to provide guidance to developers about addressing three key verification challenges: 1) how to validate a model, and show that it is a faithful representation of the device; 2) how to formalize requirements given in natural language, and demonstrate the benefits of the formalization process; and 3) how to prove requirements of a model using readily available formal verification tools.	Semantic Scholar
A model of a commercial device is used throughout the paper to demonstrate the methodology.	Semantic Scholar
A representative set of requirements are considered.	Semantic Scholar
They are based on US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) draft documentation for programmable medical devices, and on best practice in user interface design illustrated in relevant international standards.	Semantic Scholar
The methodology aims to demonstrate how to achieve the FDA's agenda of using formal methods to support the approval process for medical devices.	Semantic Scholar
This paper is concerned with leaderless synchronization of coupled delayed neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
A distributed event-triggered control strategy under the periodic sampling scheme is introduced to reduce control updates.	Semantic Scholar
By introducing a weighted average state as a virtual leader, the leaderless synchronization problem can be transformed to the stability problem of the error system, which is defined as the distance between each node and the virtual leader.	Semantic Scholar
A leaderless synchronization criterion under the periodic event-triggered scheme in strongly connected networks is first derived based on Finsler's lemma.	Semantic Scholar
The results are then extended to the network containing a directed spanning tree.	Semantic Scholar
A corollary with the lower dimension in the form of LMIs is further presented.	Semantic Scholar
Two examples are provided to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.	Semantic Scholar
Natural policy gradient (NPG) methods are promising approaches to finding locally optimal policy parameters.	Semantic Scholar
The NPG approach works well in optimizing complex policies with high-dimensional parameters, and the effectiveness of NPG methods has been demonstrated in many fields.	Semantic Scholar
However, the incremental estimation of the NPG is computationally unstable owing to its high sensitivity to the step-sizes values, especially to the one used to update the estimate of NPG.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we propose a new incremental and stable algorithm for the NPG estimation.	Semantic Scholar
We call the proposed algorithm the implicit incremental natural actor critic (I2NAC), and it is based on the idea of the implicit update.	Semantic Scholar
The convergence analysis for I2NAC is provided.	Semantic Scholar
Theoretical analysis results indicate the stability of I2NAC and the instability of conventional incremental NPG methods.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical experiments were performed, and the results show that I2NAC is less sensitive to the values of the meta-parameters, including the step-size for the NPG update, compared to the existing incremental NPG method.	Semantic Scholar
A key problem in computational neuroscience is to find simple, tractable models that are nevertheless flexible enough to capture the response properties of real neurons.	Semantic Scholar
Here we examine the capabilities of recurrent point process models known as Poisson generalized linear models (GLMs).	Semantic Scholar
These models are defined by a set of linear filters and a point nonlinearity and are conditionally Poisson spiking.	Semantic Scholar
They have desirable statistical properties for fitting and have been widely used to analyze spike trains from electrophysiological recordings.	Semantic Scholar
However, the dynamical repertoire of GLMs has not been systematically compared to that of real neurons.	Semantic Scholar
Here we show that GLMs can reproduce a comprehensive suite of canonical neural response behaviors, including tonic and phasic spiking, bursting, spike rate adaptation, type I and type II excitation, and two forms of bistability.	Semantic Scholar
GLMs can also capture stimulus-dependent changes in spike timing precision and reliability that mimic those observed in real neurons, and can exhibit varying degrees of stochasticity, from virtually deterministic responses to greater-than-Poisson variability.	Semantic Scholar
These results show that Poisson GLMs can exhibit a wide range of dynamic spiking behaviors found in real neurons, making them well suited for qualitative dynamical as well as quantitative statistical studies of single-neuron and population response properties.	Semantic Scholar
We present an effective blind image deblurring method based on a data-driven discriminative prior.	Semantic Scholar
Our work is motivated by the fact that a good image prior should favor sharp images over blurred ones.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we formulate the image prior as a binary classifier using a deep convolutional neural network.	Semantic Scholar
The learned prior is able to distinguish whether an input image is sharp or not.	Semantic Scholar
Embedded into the maximum a posterior framework, it helps blind deblurring in various scenarios, including natural, face, text, and low-illumination images, as well as non-uniform deblurring.	Semantic Scholar
However, it is difficult to optimize the deblurring method with the learned image prior as it involves a non-linear neural network.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we develop an efficient numerical approach based on the half-quadratic splitting method and gradient descent algorithm to optimize the proposed model.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we extend the proposed model to handle image dehazing.	Semantic Scholar
Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results show that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art algorithms as well as domain-specific image deblurring approaches.	Semantic Scholar
The Internet of Agents (IoA) is a current approach to the Future Internet that has arisen as an alternative to mitigate the limitations of the Internet of Things (IoT) concerning autonomy, reasoning and social capabilities.	Semantic Scholar
The aim of this paper is to present a novel architectural model governed by semantic contracts, published as linked data which describe the main aspects regarding the IoA domain, such as context, social circles, services ecosystems, IoT resources, and real-time restrictions.	Semantic Scholar
This proposal introduces some mechanisms such as (i) Linked Open Agents (LOAs) as the main unit of process for coordinating and managing IoT-objects, (ii) Linked Agent Contracts (LACs) as contractual semantic descriptions of entities of IoA ecosystems, (iii) an ontology named IoA-OWL that covers the current main aspects related to the IoA, (iv) a Reference Architecture for the IoA approach driven by LOAs and LACs, and (v) a mechanism for agent-discovery based on semantic descriptors.	Semantic Scholar
Both the model and its mechanisms are integrated, in order to improve the semantic interoperability and intelligence in heterogeneous IoT networks controlled by Multi-Agent Systems.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, a case study is proposed for a scenario of Ambient Intelligence as a working example of the novel architectural model.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, a qualitative and quantitative evaluation is then performed to analyze the applicability, performance, functionality of our proposal.	Semantic Scholar
A better performance was obtained for the agent discovery process with our architecture in contrast to JADE Yellow Pages and the Java implementation of the Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration.	Semantic Scholar
For many applications in low-power real-time robotics, stereo cameras are the sensors of choice for depth perception as they are typically cheaper and more versatile than their active counterparts.	Semantic Scholar
Their biggest drawback, however, is that they do not directly sense depth maps; instead, these must be estimated through data-intensive processes.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, appropriate algorithm selection plays an important role in achieving the desired performance characteristics.	Semantic Scholar
Motivated by applications in space and mobile robotics, we implement and evaluate a field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) accelerated adaptation of the efficient large-scale stereo (ELAS) algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Despite offering one of the best tradeoffs between efficiency and accuracy, ELAS has only been shown to run at 1.5–3 fps on a high-end CPU.	Semantic Scholar
Our system preserves all intriguing properties of the original algorithm, such as the slanted plane priors, but can achieve a frame rate of 47 fps whilst consuming under 4 W of power.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike previous FPGA-based designs, we take advantage of both components on the CPU/FPGA system-on-chip to showcase the strategy necessary to accelerate more complex and computationally diverse algorithms for such low power, real-time systems.	Semantic Scholar
Numerous methods have been developed to gain reliable real-time remote control over pilotless flying aircraft and to perform teleoperation.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, state-of-the-art brain–computer interface (BCI) research has provided an avant-garde approach to reach this goal.	Semantic Scholar
Due to its broad range of application, BCI has been the center of attention as a promising candidate for deciphering brain signals into corresponding control commands for various systems.	Semantic Scholar
This paper surveys the application of BCI in designing control modules for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).	Semantic Scholar
We first describe the basic configuration of UAVs, as well as identify the principle components of their control systems.	Semantic Scholar
We proceeded to describe different classes of BCI with emphasis on their applicability in controlling UAVs, and highlight the potential benefits and challenges in implementing each BCI paradigm.	Semantic Scholar
Details will be given on how essential strategies and key techniques regarding feature extraction, and the classification of data, as well as hybrid-modality, could be applied in this field to develop robust systems demonstrating optimal fidelity and performance.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, by reviewing the primary trends in previous studies, we attempt to address the missing steps in current research and shed light on the road map for future innovation.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a novel global tracking control approach for elastic-joint robots that can be efficiently computed and is robust against model uncertainties and input disturbances.	Semantic Scholar
Elastic-joint robots provide enhanced safety and resiliency for interaction with the environment and humans.	Semantic Scholar
On the other hand, the joint elasticity complicates the motion-control problem especially when robust and precise trajectory tracking is required.	Semantic Scholar
Our proposed control approach allows us to merge the main benefits of the two well-known control schemes: inverse-dynamics (ID) control, which can be efficiently computed thanks to modern recursive algorithms, and passivity-based (PB) tracking control, which provides enhanced robustness to model uncertainty and external disturbances.	Semantic Scholar
As an extension of our previous work, we present a detailed robustness analysis of our combined ID/PB controller, a new variant of the original scheme that shows practically relevant implications, and finally, experimental results that verify the effectiveness of the approach.	Semantic Scholar
Indirect force control (IFC) architectures are a common approach for dealing with unknown environments.	Semantic Scholar
What all IFC schemes have in common is that the relation between the set point and the actual configuration of the robot is determined by a mechanical relationship (e.g., a mass–spring–damper system).	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a set-point generation method for IFC schemes, enabling intuitive specification of mixed force and positioning tasks on joint and Cartesian levels.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the formulation of equality and inequality tasks is supported and a passivity-based stability proof is formulated using the concept of virtual energy storage.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting task programming interface is demonstrated on a 7-degree-of-freedom robot, running a joint space impedance controller.	Semantic Scholar
One sample task demonstrates the application of the developed approach and highlights the basic features.	Semantic Scholar
Although crowd analysis is a classical and extensively studied problem for the computer vision community, the vast majority of the works in the literature assume a single type of crowd, while the sociological literature classifies a number of different typologies, each one with their own distinctive traits.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we focus on a particular kind of crowd referred in sociology as spectator crowd , which consists a number of people that are “interested in watching something specific that they came to see” Berlonghi (1995).	Semantic Scholar
This is the typical social formation that attends entertainment events like sport matches, concerts, movies, etc.	Semantic Scholar
In this work we present a novel dataset, the Spectators Hockey ( S-Hock ), containing almost 30 hours of videos recorded at an ice hockey rink during the Winter Universiade “Trentino2013”.	Semantic Scholar
On these data we provide a massive annotation, focusing on the spectators at different levels of detail: from high level features describing which team a person supports and if he/she knows his/her neighbors; to a lower level, where we consider standard pose information as well as atomic actions like applauding, jumping, etc.	Semantic Scholar
We also provide annotations for the game field, which allows us to analyze the relationship between the crowd behavior and the events of the match.	Semantic Scholar
Eventually we provide more than 100 million of annotations, that can be used for many different tasks spanning from standard applications, like people counting and head pose estimation, to higher level tasks, like excitement estimation and automatic summarization.	Semantic Scholar
We provide protocols and baseline results for all of these applications, encouraging further research in these field.	Semantic Scholar

3D modeling of real objects by a 3D laser scanner has become popular in many applications, such as reverse engineering of petrochemical plants, civil engineering and construction, and digital preservation of cultural properties.	Semantic Scholar
Despite the development of lightweight and high-speed laser scanners, the complicated measurement procedure and long measurement time are still heavy burdens for widespread use of laser scanning.	Semantic Scholar
To solve these problems, a robotic 3D scanning system using multiple robots has been proposed.	Semantic Scholar
This system, named CPS-SLAM, consists of a parent robot with a 3D laser scanner and child robots with target markers.	Semantic Scholar
A large-scale 3D model is acquired by an on-board 3D laser scanner on the parent robot from several positions determined precisely by a localization technique, named the Cooperative Positioning System (CPS), that uses multiple robots.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, this system can build a 3D model without complicated post-processing procedures such as ICP.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, this system is an open-loop SLAM system and a very precise 3D model can be obtained without closed loops.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes an automatic planning technique for a laser measurement by using CPS-SLAM.	Semantic Scholar
Planning a proper scanning strategy depending on a target structure makes it possible to perform laser scanning efficiently and accurately even for a large-scale and complex environment.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed technique plans an efficient scanning strategy automatically by taking account of several criteria, such as visibility between robots, error accumulation, and efficient traveling.	Semantic Scholar
We conducted computer simulations and outdoor experiments to verify the performance of the proposed technique.	Semantic Scholar

Cardiac characteristics underlying the time/frequency domain features are limited and not comprehensive enough to reflect the temporal/dynamical nature of ECG patterns.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a dynamical ECG recognition framework for human identification and cardiovascular diseases classification via a dynamical neural learning mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method consists of two phases: a training phase and a test phase.	Semantic Scholar
In the training phase, cardiac dynamics within ECG signals is extracted (approximated) accurately by using radial basis function (RBF) neural networks through deterministic learning mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
The obtained cardiac system dynamics is represented and stored in constant RBF networks.	Semantic Scholar
An ECG signature is then derived from the extracted cardiac dynamics along the periodic ECG state trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
A bank of estimators is constructed using the extracted cardiac dynamics to represent the trained gait patterns.	Semantic Scholar
In the test phase, recognition errors are generated and taken as the similarity measure by comparing the cardiac dynamics of the trained ECG patterns and the dynamics of the test ECG pattern.	Semantic Scholar
Rapid recognition of a test ECG pattern begins with measuring the state of test pattern, and automatically proceeds with the evolution of the recognition error system.	Semantic Scholar
According to the smallest error principle, the test ECG pattern can be rapidly recognized.	Semantic Scholar
This kind of cardiac dynamics information represents the beat-to-beat temporal change of ECG modifications and the temporal/dynamical nature of ECG patterns.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, the amount of discriminability provided by the cardiac dynamics is larger than the original signals.	Semantic Scholar
This paper further discusses the extension of the proposed method for cardiovascular diseases classification.	Semantic Scholar
The constructed recognition system can distinguish and assign dynamical ECG patterns to predefined classes according to the similarity of cardiac dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments are carried out on the FuWai and PTB ECG databases to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
The motion of a mechanical system can be defined as a path through its configuration space.	Semantic Scholar
Computing such a path has a computational complexity scaling exponentially with the dimensionality of the configuration space.	Semantic Scholar
We propose to reduce the dimensionality of the configuration space by introducing the irreducible path — a path having a minimal swept volume.	Semantic Scholar
The paper consists of three parts: In part I, we define the space of all irreducible paths and show that planning a path in the irreducible path space preserves completeness of any motion planning algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
In part II, we construct an approximation to the irreducible path space of a serial kinematic chain under certain assumptions.	Semantic Scholar
In part III, we conduct motion planning using the irreducible path space for a mechanical snake in a turbine environment, for a mechanical octopus with eight arms in a pipe system and for the sideways motion of a humanoid robot moving through a room with doors and through a hole in a wall.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate that the concept of an irreducible path can be applied to any motion planning algorithm taking curvature constraints into account.	Semantic Scholar

In this letter, we propose a novel method that enables the robot to autonomously devise an appropriate control strategy from human demonstrations without a prior knowledge of the demonstrated task.	Semantic Scholar
The method is primarily based on observing the patterns and consistency in the observed dataset.	Semantic Scholar
This is obtained through a demonstration setting that uses a motion capture system, a force sensor, and muscle activity measurements.	Semantic Scholar
The variables (position and force) in the collected dataset are then segmented and analysed for each axis of the observed task frame separately.	Semantic Scholar
While checking several conditions based on the consistency, value range, and magnitude of repeated observations, the appropriate controller (i.e., position or force) is delegated to each axis of the task frame.	Semantic Scholar
In the final stage, the method also checks for a correlation between variables and muscle activity patterns to determine the desired stiffness behaviour.	Semantic Scholar
The robot then uses the derived control strategies in autonomous operation through a hybrid force/impedance controller.	Semantic Scholar
To validate the proposed method, we performed experiments on real-life tasks involving physical interaction with the environment, where we considered surface wiping, material sawing, and drilling.	Semantic Scholar
This paper describes a fruit counting pipeline based on deep learning that accurately counts fruit in unstructured environments.	Semantic Scholar
Obtaining reliable fruit counts is challenging because of variations in appearance due to illumination changes and occlusions from foliage and neighboring fruits.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel approach that uses deep learning to map from input images to total fruit counts.	Semantic Scholar
The pipeline utilizes a custom crowdsourcing platform to quickly label large data sets.	Semantic Scholar
A blob detector based on a fully convolutional network extracts candidate regions in the images.	Semantic Scholar
A counting algorithm based on a second convolutional network then estimates the number of fruits in each region.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, a linear regression model maps that fruit count estimate to a final fruit count.	Semantic Scholar
We analyze the performance of the pipeline on two distinct data sets of oranges in daylight, and green apples at night, utilizing human generated labels as ground truth.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that the pipeline has a short training time and performs well with a limited data set size.	Semantic Scholar
Our method generalizes across both data sets and is able to perform well even on highly occluded fruits that are challenging for human labelers to annotate.	Semantic Scholar
This paper deals with the problem of 3D object retrieval using a part-based representation.	Semantic Scholar
The premise in this context is that similar objects will consist of similar parts.	Semantic Scholar
A part-based representation is proposed, where each object is segmented, and represented as a labeled graph, with nodes corresponding to parts, and edges connecting adjacent parts.	Semantic Scholar
The calculation of the distance between two segmented objects is formulated as a multi-label optimization problem, taking into account the aforementioned graphs.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art on several datasets, while it has a clear advantage in the case of articulated objects.	Semantic Scholar
Driving simulators are nowadays a widely used tool in the automotive industry.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the need for safe and repeatable conditions in automated driving testing is now defining a new challenge: to extend the use of the tool to nonprofessional drivers.	Semantic Scholar
Quality of the motion control strategies in generating both realistic and feasible inputs to the driver is therefore, more than ever, a crucial aspect.	Semantic Scholar
The motion strategies are implemented in the so-called motion cueing algorithms (MCAs).	Semantic Scholar
A recently proposed effective approach to MCA is based on model predictive control (MPC), as it is well suited to solve constrained optimal control problems and to take advantage of models of the human sensing system.	Semantic Scholar
However, the predictive aspect of the algorithm has not been exploited yet, due to the hard real-time requirement when using long prediction windows.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a real-time implementation of an MPC-based MCA with predictive feature is presented, endowed with an on-line switching policy to a nonpredictive algorithm when the expected driver behavior is considered unreliable.	Semantic Scholar
The motion action based on the actual driver behavior and the expected one are considered in the same procedure, thus fully exploiting the availability of a perceptive model.	Semantic Scholar
An optimal tuning procedure is also proposed, based on a multiobjective optimization, where both performance improvement due to the prediction exploitation, and robustness to varying driver behaviour are considered.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, a characterization of the driver skill level is proposed and validated in an experimental environment for the specific case of the vertical DOF.	Semantic Scholar
In contexts where robots share their workspace with humans, safety is of utmost importance.	Semantic Scholar
Consequently, in recent years, a big impulse has been given to the design of human-friendly robots by involving both mechanical and control design aspects.	Semantic Scholar
Regarding controller design, this often involves introducing compliance and ensuring asymptotic stability using an interaction control scheme and passivity theory.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, when human operators physically interact with the robot during work, strict safety measures become necessary with some of these including power and force limitations [1].	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, a novel impedance control technique for collaborative robots is presented.	Semantic Scholar
The featured controller allows a safe human–robot interaction through energy and power limitations, assuring passivity through energy tanks.	Semantic Scholar

This article presents the development of a robot-integrated smart home (RiSH) which can be used for research in assistive technologies for elderly care.	Semantic Scholar
The RiSH integrates a home service robot, a home sensor network, a body sensor network, a mobile device, cloud servers, and remote caregivers.	Semantic Scholar
A layered architecture is proposed to guide the design and implementation of the RiSH software.	Semantic Scholar
Basic service functions are developed to allow the RiSH to recognize human body activity using an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and the home service robot to perceive the environment through audio signals.	Semantic Scholar
Based on these functions,we developed two low-level applications: (1) particle filter-based human localization and tracking using wearable motion sensors and distributed binary sensors; (2) Dynamic Bayesian Networkbased human activity recognition using microphones and distributed binary sensors.	Semantic Scholar
Both applications extend the robot’s perception beyond its onboard sensors.	Semantic Scholar
Utilizing the low-level applications, a highlevel application is realized that detects and responds to human falls.	Semantic Scholar
We conducted experiments in our RiSH testbed to evaluate auditory perception services, human body activity recognition, human position tracking, sound-based human activity monitoring, and fall detection and rescue.	Semantic Scholar
Twelve human subjects were asked to conduct daily activities in the testbed and mimic falls.	Semantic Scholar
All data of their movement, body activities, and sound events were collected by the robot.	Semantic Scholar
Human trajectories were estimated with a root mean square error of less than 0.2 m. The robot was able to recognize 37 human activities through sound events with an average accuracy of 88% and detect falling sounds with an accuracy of 80% at the frame level.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments show the operation of the various components in the RiSH and the capabilities of the home service robot in monitoring and assisting the resident.	Semantic Scholar

Existing research on dynamically capable legged robots, particularly those based on spring–mass models, generally considers improving in isolation either the stability and control accuracy on the rough terrain, or the energetic efficiency in steady state.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a new method to address both, based on the hierarchical embedding of a simple spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) template model with a tunable radial damping coefficient into a realistic leg structure with series-elastic actuation.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach allows using the entire stance phase to inject/remove energy both for transient steps and in steady state, decreasing the maximum necessary actuator power while eliminating wasteful sources of the negative work.	Semantic Scholar
In doing so, we preserve the validity of the existing analytic approximations to the underlying SLIP model, propose improvements to increase the predictive accuracy, and construct accurate, model-based controllers that use the tunable damping coefficient of the template model.	Semantic Scholar
We provide extensive comparative simulations to establish the energy and power efficiency advantages of our approach, together with the accuracy of model-based gait control methods.	Semantic Scholar
Recent studies show that individuals in a social network can be divided into different groups of densely connected communities, and these individuals who bridge different communities, referred to as structural hole spanners, have great potential to acquire resources/information from communities and thus benefit from the access.	Semantic Scholar
Structural hole spanners are crucial in many real applications such as community detections, diffusion controls, viral marketing, etc.	Semantic Scholar
In spite of their importance, little attention has been paid to them.	Semantic Scholar
Particularly, how to accurately characterize the structural hole spanners and how to devise efficient yet scalable algorithms to find them in a large social network are fundamental issues.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study the top-$k$  structural hole spanner problem.	Semantic Scholar
We first provide a novel model to measure the quality of structural hole spanners through exploiting the structural hole spanner properties.	Semantic Scholar
Due to its NP-hardness, we then devise two efficient yet scalable algorithms, by developing innovative filtering techniques that can filter out unlikely solutions as quickly as possible, while the proposed techniques are built up on fast estimations of the upper and lower bounds on the cost of an optimal solution and make use of articulation points in real social networks.	Semantic Scholar
We finally conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, and to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms using real world datasets.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can capture the characteristics of structural hole spanners accurately, and the structural hole spanners found by the proposed algorithms are much better than those by existing algorithms in all considered social networks, while the running times of the proposed algorithms are very fast.

A preliminary study onmethods and devices used for fingers tracking led to the choice of a simplified kinematic model of the human hand on the basis of the available motion tracking system.	Semantic Scholar
Using the same criteria, the analysis of protocols for markers allocation led to define the number and a method for their arrangement on the fingers and palm.	Semantic Scholar
In order to overcome the limitation of the Motion Capture System, a method for identification and labeling has been developed according to their anatomical arrangement.	Semantic Scholar
Afterwards, the tracking is performed using the constraints between marker positions on the kinematic chain of the hand and a dynamic labeling algorithm robust with respect to noise, outliers and loss of markers.	Semantic Scholar
The validation is performed using the right hand of different subjects and considering different tasks involving flexion/extension and abduction/adduction of fingers and thumb opposition.	Semantic Scholar

Use of social network is the basic functionality of today's life.	Semantic Scholar
With the advent of more and more online social media, the information available and its utilization have come under the threat of several anomalies.	Semantic Scholar
Anomalies are the major cause of online frauds which allow information access by unauthorized users as well as information forging.	Semantic Scholar
One of the anomalies that act as a silent attacker is the horizontal anomaly.	Semantic Scholar
These are the anomalies caused by a user because of his/her variable behavior towards different sources.	Semantic Scholar
Horizontal anomalies are difficult to detect and hazardous for any network.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a self-healing neuro-fuzzy approach (NHAD) is used for the detection, recovery, and removal of horizontal anomalies efficiently and accurately.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach operates over the five paradigms, namely, missing links, reputation gain, significant difference, trust properties, and trust score.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach is evaluated with three datasets: DARPA'98 benchmark dataset, synthetic dataset, and real-time traffic.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that the accuracy of the proposed NHAD model for 10 to 30 percent anomalies in synthetic dataset ranges between 98.08 and 99.88 percent.	Semantic Scholar
The evaluation over DARPA'98 dataset demonstrates that the proposed approach is better than the existing solutions as it provides 99.97 percent detection rate for anomalous class.	Semantic Scholar

Robotic-assisted surgery holds significant promise to improve patient treatment by allowing surgeons to perform many types of complex operations with greater precision and flexibility than before.	Semantic Scholar
In order to facilitate automation of robotic surgery and more practical training for surgeons, more detailed comprehension of the surgical procedures is needed.	Semantic Scholar
In this regard, a key step is to develop techniques that segment and recognize surgical tasks intelligently.	Semantic Scholar
Surgeries involve complex continuous activities that may contain superfluous, repeated actions, and temporal variation.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, any segmentation approach that has the capability to account for all these characteristics is of increased interest.	Semantic Scholar
Toward this goal, we develop a new segmentation algorithm, namely soft-boundary unsupervised gesture segmentation (Soft-UGS), to segment the temporal sequence of surgical gestures and model gradual transitions between them using fuzzy membership scores.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed framework is evaluated using a real robotic surgery dataset.	Semantic Scholar
Our extensive set of experiments and evaluation metrics show that the proposed Soft-UGS method is able to match manual annotations with upto 83% sensitivity, 81% precision, and 73% segmentation score.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that the proposed soft boundary approach can provide more insight into the surgical activities and can contribute to the automation of robotic surgeries.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the recent technological progress, Human–Robot Interaction (HRI) has become a major field of research in both engineering and artistic realms, particularly so in the last decade.	Semantic Scholar
The mainstream interests are, however, extremely diverse: challenges are continuously shifting, the evolution of robot’ skills, aswell as the advances inmethods for understanding their environment radically impact the design and implementation of research prototypes.	Semantic Scholar
When directly deployed in a public installation or artistic performances, robots help foster the next level of understanding in HRI.	Semantic Scholar
To this effect, this paper presents a successful interdisciplinary art-science-technology project, the Aerostabiles, leading to a new way of conducting HRI research.	Semantic Scholar
The project consists of developing amechatronic, intelligent platform embodied in multiple geometric blimps – cubes – that hover and move in the air.	Semantic Scholar
The artistic context of this project required a number of advances in engineering on the aspects of localization and control systems, flight dynamics, as well as interaction strategies, and their evolution through periods of collective activities called ‘‘research–creation residencies’’.

We discuss the inductive classification problem by proposing a joint framework termed Adaptive Non-negative Projective Semi-Supervised Learning (ANP-SSL).	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, ANP-SSL integrates the adaptive inductive label propagation, adaptive reconstruction weights learning and the neighborhood preserving projective nonnegative matrix factorization (PNMF) explicitly.	Semantic Scholar
To make the label prediction results more accurate, ANP-SSL incorporates the semi-supervised data representation and classification errors into regular PNMF for minimization, which can enable our ANP-SSL to perform the adaptive weights learning and label propagation over the spatially local and part-based data representations, which differs from most existing work that usually assign weights and predict labels based on the original data that often has noise and corruptions.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, existing methods usually pre-assign weights before the process of label estimation, but such operation cannot ensure the learnt weights by independent step to be optimal for the subsequent classification.	Semantic Scholar
The combined representation error can also make the learnt reduced part-based representations of neighborhood preserving PNMF, which can potentially enhance the prediction results.	Semantic Scholar
By minimizing the classification error jointly over the neighborhood preserving nonnegative representation can make the embedding based classification efficient.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive results on several public image databases verified the effectiveness of our ANP-SSL, compared with other state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
Soft robots are one of the most significant recent evolutions in robotics.	Semantic Scholar
They rely on compliant physical structures purposefully designed to embody desired characteristics.	Semantic Scholar
Since their introduction, they have shown remarkable applicability in overcoming their rigid counterparts in such areas as interaction with humans, adaptability, energy efficiency, and maximization of peak performance.	Semantic Scholar
Nonetheless, we believe that research on novel soft robot applications is still slowed by the difficulty in obtaining or developing a working soft robot structure to explore novel applications.	Semantic Scholar
Smartphone-based human indoor localization was previously implemented using wireless sensor networks at the cost of sensing infrastructure deployment.	Semantic Scholar
Motivated by increasing research attention on location-aware human–robot interaction, we propose a robot-assisted human indoor localization scheme utilizing acoustic ranging between a self-localized mobile robot and smartphones.	Semantic Scholar
Data from the lowcost Kinect vision sensor are fused with smartphone-based acoustic ranging, and an extended Kalman filter based localization algorithm is developed for real-time dynamic position estimation and tracking.	Semantic Scholar
Real robot–smartphone experiments are performed, and performances are evaluated in various indoor environments under different environmental noises andwith different humanwalking speed.	Semantic Scholar
Comparing to existing indoor smartphone localization methods, the proposed system does not rely on wireless sensing infrastructure, and has comparable localization accuracy with increased flexibility and scalability due to the mobility of the robot.	Semantic Scholar

Information diffusion is a natural phenomenon occurring in social networks.	Semantic Scholar
The adoption behavior of a node toward an information piece in a social network can be affected by different factors, e.g., freshness and hotness.	Semantic Scholar
Previously, many diffusion models are proposed to consider one or several fixed factors.	Semantic Scholar
In fact, the factors affecting adoption decision of a node are different from one to another and may not be seen before.	Semantic Scholar
For a different scenario of diffusion with new factors, previous diffusion models may not model the diffusion well, or are not applicable at all.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, uncertainty of information exposure intrinsically exists between two connected nodes, which causes modeling diffusion more challenge in social networks.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, our aim is to design a diffusion model in which factors considered are flexible to be extended and changed and the uncertainly of information exposure is explicitly tackled.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, with different factors, our diffusion model can be adapted to more scenarios of diffusion without requiring the modification of the learning framework.	Semantic Scholar
We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that our diffusion model is effective on two important tasks of information diffusion, namely activation prediction and spread estimation.	Semantic Scholar

The scalability of low-rank representation (LRR) to large-scale data is still a major research issue, because it is extremely time-consuming to solve singular value decomposition (SVD) in each optimization iteration especially for large matrices.	Semantic Scholar
Several methods were proposed to speed up LRR, but they are still computationally heavy, and the overall representation results were also found degenerated.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a novel method, called accelerated LRR (ALRR) is proposed for large-scale data.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed accelerated method integrates matrix factorization with nuclear-norm minimization to find a low-rank representation.	Semantic Scholar
In our proposed method, the large square matrix of representation coefficients is transformed into a significantly smaller square matrix, on which SVD can be efficiently implemented.	Semantic Scholar
The size of the transformed matrix is not related to the number of data points and the optimization of ALRR is linear with the number of data points.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed ALRR is convex, accurate, robust, and efficient for large-scale data.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, ALRR is compared with state-of-the-art in subspace clustering and semi-supervised classification on real image datasets.	Semantic Scholar

Cluster analysis was performed on ten subsamples, and the obtained clusters were cross-validated.	Semantic Scholar
Several types of skier behavior were found.	Semantic Scholar
Temporal clustering revealed that skier patterns differ according to time of maximal performance and length of stay in the ski lift transportation system.	Semantic Scholar
Spatial clustering revealed that it is reasonable to have as many clusters as ski lifts in a ski resort, since skiers tend to choose a dominant ski lift during a skier-day.	Semantic Scholar
The detected patterns reveal valuable information that can be used for potential improvement of products and services offered by ski resorts.	Semantic Scholar
Underactuated and compliant hands, frequently referred to as soft hands, have been recently proposed to overcome common issues of multifingered robotic hands.	Semantic Scholar
Although several prototypes have been developed, there is still a lack of systematic ways to model and control these devices to get grasps exploiting their intrinsic features.	Semantic Scholar
Classical tools can hardly be applied when contact surfaces are deformable and hand kinematics is not uniquely defined due to underactuation.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a method to model underactuated compliant hands.	Semantic Scholar
The model captures how the hand closes analyzing the motion of suitable reference points defined on the hand.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we present a procedure to compute the preferred grasping direction of a given hand, namely, the closure signature (CS), and then we use this information to plan power grasps.	Semantic Scholar
The feasibility of the proposed method has been validated by performing experiments with a soft hand fixed to a robotic arm.	Semantic Scholar
The use of the CS proved to increase the performance of the grasp planner.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method can easily be extended to other underactuated compliant hands.	Semantic Scholar
Blind source separation—the extraction of independent sources from a mixture—is an important problem for both artificial and natural signal processing.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we address a special case of this problem when sources (but not the mixing matrix) are known to be nonnegative—for example, due to the physical nature of the sources.	Semantic Scholar
We search for the solution to this problem that can be implemented using biologically plausible neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we consider the online setting where the data set is streamed to a neural network.	Semantic Scholar
The novelty of our approach is that we formulate blind nonnegative source separation as a similarity matching problem and derive neural networks from the similarity matching objective.	Semantic Scholar
Importantly, synaptic weights in our networks are updated according to biologically plausible local learning rules.	Semantic Scholar
This paper addresses the problem of image-based event recognition by transferring deep representations learned from object and scene datasets.	Semantic Scholar
First we empirically investigate the correlation of the concepts of object, scene, and event, thus motivating our representation transfer methods.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this empirical study, we propose an iterative selection method to identify a subset of object and scene classes deemed most relevant for representation transfer.	Semantic Scholar
Afterwards, we develop three transfer techniques: (1) initialization-based transfer, (2) knowledge-based transfer, and (3) data-based transfer.	Semantic Scholar
These newly designed transfer techniques exploit multitask learning frameworks to incorporate extra knowledge from other networks or additional datasets into the fine-tuning procedure of event CNNs.	Semantic Scholar
These multitask learning frameworks turn out to be effective in reducing the effect of over-fitting and improving the generalization ability of the learned CNNs.	Semantic Scholar
We perform experiments on four event recognition benchmarks: the ChaLearn LAP Cultural Event Recognition dataset, the Web Image Dataset for Event Recognition, the UIUC Sports Event dataset, and the Photo Event Collection dataset.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm successfully transfers object and scene representations towards the event dataset and achieves the current state-of-the-art performance on all considered datasets.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we aim at analyzing the approximation abilities of shallow networks in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs).	Semantic Scholar
We prove that there is a probability measure such that the achievable lower bound for approximating by shallow nets can be realized for all functions in balls of reproducing kernel Hilbert space with high probability, which is different with the classical minimax approximation error estimates.	Semantic Scholar
This result together with the existing approximation results for deep nets shows the limitations for shallow nets and provides a theoretical explanation on why deep nets perform better than shallow nets.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we present and evaluate a system, which allows a mobile robot to autonomously detect, model, and re-recognize objects in everyday environments.	Semantic Scholar
While other systems have demonstrated one of these elements, to our knowledge, we present the first system, which is capable of doing all of these things, all without human interaction, in normal indoor scenes.	Semantic Scholar
Our system detects objects to learn by modeling the static part of the environment and extracting dynamic elements.	Semantic Scholar
It then creates and executes a view plan around a dynamic element to gather additional views for learning.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, these views are fused to create an object model.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of the system is evaluated on publicly available datasets as well as on data collected by the robot in both controlled and uncontrolled scenarios.	Semantic Scholar

Robust object tracking requires knowledge and understanding of the object being tracked: its appearance, its motion, and how it changes over time.	Semantic Scholar
A tracker must be able to modify its underlying model and adapt to new observations.	Semantic Scholar
"We present Re<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$^3,$</tex-math></inline-formula> a real-time deep object tracker capable of incorporating temporal information into its model."	Semantic Scholar
"Rather than focusing on a limited set of objects or training a model at test-time to track a specific instance, we pretrain our generic tracker on a large variety of objects and efficiently update on the fly; Re<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$^3$</tex-math> </inline-formula> simultaneously tracks and updates the appearance model with a single forward pass."	Semantic Scholar
This lightweight model is capable of tracking objects at 150 FPS while attaining competitive results on challenging benchmarks.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that our method handles temporary occlusion better than other comparable trackers using experiments that directly measure performance on sequences with occlusion.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a distributed algorithm for the cooperative pursuit of multiple evaders using multiple pursuers in a bounded convex environment.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm is suitable for intercepting rogue drones in protected airspace, among other applications.	Semantic Scholar
The pursuers do not know the evaders’ policy, but by using a global “area-minimization” strategy based on a Voronoi tessellation of the environment, we guarantee the capture of all evaders in finite time.	Semantic Scholar
We present a decentralized version of this policy applicable in two-dimensional (2-D) and 3-D environments, and show in multiple simulations that it outperforms other decentralized multipursuer heuristics.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments with both autonomous and human-controlled robots were conducted to demonstrate the practicality of the approach.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, human-controlled evaders are not able to avoid capture with the algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Shared control strategies can improve task performance in teleoperation.	Semantic Scholar
In such systems, automation guides or corrects a human operator.	Semantic Scholar
The amount of correction or guidance that is provided is denoted the level of automation.	Semantic Scholar
As the variety of teleoperation tasks is large, manually specifying the underlying automation is time consuming.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present an approach to program this automated system by demonstration.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach determines the level of automation online, by combining the confidence of automation and teleoperator.	Semantic Scholar
We present particular implementations of our approach for haptic shared control and state shared control.	Semantic Scholar
The method is evaluated in a user study.	Semantic Scholar
Although the subjects indicated they preferred the learned shared control strategies, teleoperation performance did not improve our metric (task execution time).	Semantic Scholar
This study considers a delayed neural network with excitatory and inhibitory shortcuts.	Semantic Scholar
The global stability of the trivial equilibrium is investigated based on Lyapunov's direct method and the delay-dependent criteria are obtained.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown that both the excitatory and inhibitory shortcuts decrease the stability interval, but a time delay can be employed as a global stabilizer.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we analyze the bounds of the eigenvalues of the adjacent matrix using matrix perturbation theory and then obtain the generalized sufficient conditions for local stability.	Semantic Scholar
The possibility of small inhibitory shortcuts is helpful for maintaining stability.	Semantic Scholar
The mechanisms of instability, bifurcation modes, and chaos are also investigated.	Semantic Scholar
Compared with methods based on mean-field theory, the proposed method can guarantee the stability of the system in most cases with random events.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method is effective for cases where excitatory and inhibitory shortcuts exist simultaneously in the network.	Semantic Scholar
Perishable intermediate products are commonly seen in practical manufacturing systems, where the time that intermediate products spend in a buffer is limited by a certain number.	Semantic Scholar
Parts have to be scrapped if their maximum allowed time is exceeded.	Semantic Scholar
In order to reduce the scrap ratio and optimize the production operation in a timely manner, the transient behavior of the system needs to be investigated to evaluate and predict the system performance at any time instance.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we develop a Markov chain model to analyze the transient behaviors of a two-machine geometric production system accounting for scrap due to the perishability of intermediate products.	Semantic Scholar
The analytical formulas are derived to evaluate transient performance.	Semantic Scholar
Compared with simulation, it is shown that the proposed method could estimate the system's transient performance with high accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
Urban scenes acquisition is very often performed using laser scanners onboard a vehicle.	Semantic Scholar
In parallel, color information is also acquired through a set of coarsely aligned camera pictures.	Semantic Scholar
The question of combining both measures naturally arises for adding color to the 3D points or enhancing the geometry, but it faces important challenges.	Semantic Scholar
Indeed, 3D geometry acquisition is highly accurate while the images suffer from distortion and are only coarsely registered to the geometry.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we introduce a two-step method to register images to large-scale complex point clouds.	Semantic Scholar
Our method performs the image-to-geometry registration by iteratively registering the real image to a synthetic image obtained from the estimated camera pose and the point cloud, using either reflectance or normal information.	Semantic Scholar
First a coarse registration is performed by generating a wide-angle synthetic image and considering that small pitch and yaw rotations can be estimated as translations in the image plane.	Semantic Scholar
Then a fine registration is performed using a new image metric which is adapted to the difference of modality between the real and synthetic images.	Semantic Scholar
This new image metric is more resilient to missing data and large transformations than standard Mutual Information.	Semantic Scholar
In the process, we also introduce a method to generate synthetic images from a 3D point cloud that is adapted to large-scale urban scenes with occlusions and sparse areas.	Semantic Scholar
The efficiency of our algorithm is demonstrated both qualitatively and quantitatively on datasets of urban scans and associated images.	Semantic Scholar

With advances in geo-positioning technologies and mobile internet, location-based services have attracted much attention, and spatial keyword queries are catching on fast.	Semantic Scholar
However, as far as we aware, no prior work considers the temporal information of geo-tagged objects.	Semantic Scholar
Temporal information is important in the spatial keyword query because many objects are not always valid.	Semantic Scholar
For example, visitors may plan their trips according to the opening time of attractions.	Semantic Scholar
"In this paper, we identify and solve a novel problem, i.e., the time-aware Boolean spatial keyword query (TABSKQ), which returns the <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""gao-ieq1-2742956.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> objects that satisfy users’ spatio-temporal description and textual constraint."	Semantic Scholar
"We first present pruning strategies and algorithm based on the CIR <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$^{+}$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""gao-ieq2-2742956.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula>-tree (i.e., the CIR-tree with temporal information)."	Semantic Scholar
Then, we propose an efficient index structure, called the TA-tree, and its corresponding algorithms, which can prune the search space using both spatio-temporal and textual information.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we study an interesting TABSKQ variant, i.e., Joint TABSKQ (JTABSKQ), which aims to process a set of TABSKQs jointly, and extend our techniques to tackle it.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments with real datasets offer insight into the performance of our proposed indices and algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a novel fully convolutional two-stream fusion network (FCTSFN) for interactiveimage segmentation.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed network includes two sub-networks: a two-stream late fusion network (TSLFN) that predicts the foreground at a reduced resolution, and a multi-scale refining network (MSRN) that refines the foreground at full resolution.	Semantic Scholar
The TSLFN includes two distinct deep streams followed by a fusion network.	Semantic Scholar
The intuition is that, since user interactions are more direct information on foreground/background than the image itself, the two-stream structure of the TSLFN reduces the number of layers between the pure user interaction features and the network output, allowing the user interactions to have a more direct impact on the segmentation result.	Semantic Scholar
The MSRN fuses the features from different layers of TSLFN with different scales, in order to seek the local to global information on the foreground to refine the segmentation result at full resolution.	Semantic Scholar
We conduct comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that the proposed network achieves competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art interactive image segmentation methods.	Semantic Scholar

Investigation of the role of the local field potential (LFP) fluctuations in encoding the received sensory information by the nervous system remains largely unknown.	Semantic Scholar
On the other hand, transmission of these translation rules in information transmission between the structure of sensory stimuli and the cortical oscillations to the bio-inspired artificial neural networks operating at the efficiency of the nervous system is still a vague puzzle.	Semantic Scholar
In order to move towards this important goal, computational neuroscience tools can be useful so, we simulated a large-scale network of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons with synaptic connections consisting of AMPA and GABA currents as a model of cortical populations.	Semantic Scholar
Spiking network was equipped with spike-based unsupervised weight optimization based on the dynamical behavior of the excitatory (AMPA) and inhibitory (GABA) synapses using Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) on the MNIST benchmark and we specified how the generated LFP by the network contained information about input patterns.	Semantic Scholar
The main result of this article is that the calculated coefficients of Prolate spheroidal wave functions (PSWF) from the input pattern with mean square error (MSE) criterion and power spectrum of LFP with maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) are equal.	Semantic Scholar
The more important result is that 82.3% of PSWF coefficients are the same as the connecting weights of the cortical neurons to the classifying neurons after the completion of the training process.	Semantic Scholar
Higher compliance percentage of coefficients with synaptic weights (82.3%) gives the expectance us that this coding rule will be able to extend to biological systems.	Semantic Scholar
Eventually, we introduced the cortical spiking network as an information channel, which transmits the information of the input pattern in the form of PSWF coefficients to the power spectrum of the output generated LFP.	Semantic Scholar
Untethered microrobot has been regarded as one of the most powerful tools for performing specific in vitro/vivo tasks, especially magnetic actuated microrobot owing to its biocompatible energy source.	Semantic Scholar
However, although numerous design and fabrication technologies of magnetic microrobot have been developed, the improvement of magnetic actuation manner reaches the limit, which mainly relies on the specific structure design (helix) or strong gradient magnetic field to realize locomotion.	Semantic Scholar
Inspired from surface cilia dependent paramecium swimming, this letter reports a new self-assembly magnetic actuation concept design for bulk biomaterial motion based on the partial asymmetrical heterofunction of magnetic chain units.	Semantic Scholar
Compared with the existing design and fabrication of magnetic microrobot actuators, our proposed self-assembly magnetic chain unit method is succinct, economical, structure unconstrained, and material unconstrained.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, the tanglesome bulk fiber fabrication based on flow-focusing microcapillary system is first introduced, which is utilized for structure unconstrained and material unconstrained actuation demonstration.	Semantic Scholar
Second, the six degrees of freedom electromagnetic coil system is proposed for presenting the magnetic actuation based on self-assembly magnetic chain units.	Semantic Scholar
After that, the self-assembly mechanism and magnetic control mechanism are developed to explain the fabrication and actuation procedure.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the self-assembled magnetic chain units can achieve up to 150 $\mu$m length during the fabrication process, which can actuate bulk biomaterial with much larger size than itself.	Semantic Scholar
The self-assembly magnetic chain unit and actuation experimental results verify the feasibility and practicability of the above-mentioned concepts.	Semantic Scholar
This research opens new prospects for magnetic microrobot actuation, which is expected to advance the biomedical area, such as for in vitro/vivo targeted therapy and organ-on-a-chip research.	Semantic Scholar
We address the problem of fingertip design by leveraging on the fact that most grasp contacts share a few classes of local geometries.	Semantic Scholar
In order to maximize the contact areas for achieving more robust grasps, we first define the concept of Contact Primitive, which represents a set of contacts of similar local geometries.	Semantic Scholar
Thereafter, we propose a uniform cost algorithm, which is formulated as a decision making process in a tree structure, to cluster a set of example grasp contacts into a finite set of Contact Primitives.	Semantic Scholar
We design fingertips by optimization to match the local geometry of each contact primitive, and then three-dimensionally print them using soft materials to compensate for optimization residuals.	Semantic Scholar
For novel objects, we provide an efficient algorithm to generate grasp contacts that match the fingertip geometries while together forming stable grasps.	Semantic Scholar
Comparing to a baseline of flat fingertip design, the experiment results show that our design significantly improves grasp stability, and it is more robust against various uncertainties.	Semantic Scholar
By looking at a person’s hands, one can often tell what the person is going to do next, how his/her hands are moving and where they will be, because an actor’s intentions shape his/her movement kinematics during action execution.	Semantic Scholar
Similarly, active systems with real-time constraints must not simply rely on passive video-segment classification, but they have to continuously update their estimates and predict future actions.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study the prediction of dexterous actions.	Semantic Scholar
We recorded videos of subjects performing different manipulation actions on the same object, such as “squeezing”, “flipping”, “washing”, “wiping” and “scratching” with a sponge.	Semantic Scholar
In psychophysical experiments, we evaluated human observers’ skills in predicting actions from video sequences of different length, depicting the hand movement in the preparation and execution of actions before and after contact with the object.	Semantic Scholar
We then developed a recurrent neural network based method for action prediction using as input image patches around the hand.	Semantic Scholar
We also used the same formalism to predict the forces on the finger tips using for training synchronized video and force data streams.	Semantic Scholar
Evaluations on two new datasets show that our system closely matches human performance in the recognition task, and demonstrate the ability of our algorithms to predict in real time what and how a dexterous action is performed.	Semantic Scholar
Twenty years ago in this journal, In Pursuit of the Holy Grail laid out a strategic vision for constraint programming.	Semantic Scholar

Extraterrestrial drilling is an important sampling method for understanding the formation of another celestial body and finding traces of life beyond earth.	Semantic Scholar
Currently, such tasks mainly rely on remotely controlled space robots.	Semantic Scholar
Because of limited energy available for space robots, it is highly demanded to improve the energy efficiency in the extraterrestrial drilling tasks.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose an algorithm called combined power map (CPM) method that can optimize extraterrestrial drilling strategies in order to improve energy efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm comprehensively considers the effect of sampling positions, robot positions, and robotic arm configurations on drilling energy consumption and has the ability to manage the energy efficiency gain and corresponding risks.	Semantic Scholar
Simulations show that the CPM method can significantly reduce the drilling energy consumption and effectively limit accompanying risks.	Semantic Scholar
Psychological stress is threatening people’s health.	Semantic Scholar
It is non-trivial to detect stress timely for proactive care.	Semantic Scholar
With the popularity of social media, people are used to sharing their daily activities and interacting with friends on social media platforms, making it feasible to leverage online social network data for stress detection.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we find that users stress state is closely related to that of his/her friends in social media, and we employ a large-scale dataset from real-world social platforms to systematically study the correlation of users’ stress states and social interactions.	Semantic Scholar
We first define a set of stress-related textual, visual, and social attributes from various aspects, and then propose a novel hybrid model - a factor graph model combined with Convolutional Neural Network to leverage tweet content and social interaction information for stress detection.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that the proposed model can improve the detection performance by 6-9 percent in F1-score.	Semantic Scholar
By further analyzing the social interaction data, we also discover several intriguing phenomena, i.e., the number of social structures of sparse connections (i.e., with no delta connections) of stressed users is around 14 percent higher than that of non-stressed users, indicating that the social structure of stressed users’ friends tend to be less connected and less complicated than that of non-stressed users.

Ensemble forecasting is a widely-used numerical prediction method for modeling the evolution of nonlinear dynamic systems.	Semantic Scholar
To predict the future state of such systems, a set of ensemble member forecasts is generated from multiple runs of computer models, where each run is obtained by perturbing the starting condition or using a different model representation of the system.	Semantic Scholar
The ensemble mean or median is typically chosen as a point estimate for the ensemble member forecasts.	Semantic Scholar
These approaches are limited in that they assume each ensemble member is equally skillful and may not preserve the temporal autocorrelation of the predicted time series.	Semantic Scholar
To overcome these limitations, we present an online multi-task learning framework called ORION to estimate the optimal weights for combining the ensemble member forecasts.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike other existing formulations, the proposed framework is novel in that its learning algorithm must backtrack and revise its previous forecasts before making future predictions if the earlier forecasts were incorrect when verified against new observation data.	Semantic Scholar
We termed this strategy as online learning with restart.	Semantic Scholar
Our proposed framework employs a graph Laplacian regularizer to ensure consistency of the predicted time series.	Semantic Scholar
It can also accommodate different types of loss functions, including  $\epsilon$ -insensitive and quantile loss functions, the latter of which is particularly useful for extreme value prediction.	Semantic Scholar
A theoretical proof demonstrating the convergence of our algorithm is also given.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on seasonal soil moisture forecasts from 12 major river basins in North America demonstrate the superiority of ORION compared to other baseline algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Adaptive systems have used a variety of approaches to return the task responsibility back to the user, including restoration of performance or physiological thresholds, leveling of task loads, and user-initiated deactivation.	Semantic Scholar
Little attention has been paid to evaluating the relative effectiveness of these various hand-off mechanisms, or the impact that these mechanisms may have on operator workload and situation awareness (SA).	Semantic Scholar
This study uses an Improved Performance Research Integration Tool simulation, based upon a human-in-the-loop study, to examine two different revoking strategies (minimum duration and workload threshold) across numerous levels in order to identify impacts on operator workload and SA.	Semantic Scholar
This study finds that operator workload and SA are affected by the type of revoking strategy as well as the particular level used for that strategy.	Semantic Scholar
For the scenario examined, automation revoking that relied upon a minimum duration of at least 5 s was found to be more effective in reducing workload and increasing SA than using a revoking strategy based upon workload thresholds.	Semantic Scholar
Mobile robot localization consists in estimation of robot pose by using real-time measurements.	Semantic Scholar
The Internet of Things (IoT) adds a new dimension to this process by enabling communications with smart objects at anytime and anywhere.	Semantic Scholar
Thus data used by localization process can come both from the robot on-board sensors and from environment objects, mobile or not, able to sense the robot.	Semantic Scholar
The paper considers localization problem as a nonlinear bounded-error estimation of the state vector whose components are the robot coordinates.	Semantic Scholar
The approach based on interval analysis is able to answer the constraints of IoT by easily taking account a heterogeneous set and a variable number of measurements.	Semantic Scholar
Bounded-error state estimation can be an alternative to other approaches, notably particle filtering which is sensible to non-consistent measures, large measure errors, and drift of robot evolution model.	Semantic Scholar
The theoretical formulation of the set-membership approach and the application to the estimation of the robot localization are addressed first.	Semantic Scholar
In order to meet more realistic conditions the way of reducing the effect of environment model inaccuracies, evolution model drift, outliers and disruptive events such as robot kidnapping is introduced.	Semantic Scholar
By integrating these additional treatments to the setmembership approach we propose a bounded-error estimator using multihypothesis tracking.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation results show the contribution of each step of the estimator.	Semantic Scholar
Real experiments focus on global localization and specific treatments for synchronizing measurements and processing outliers.	Semantic Scholar
Robot localization is the problem of determining a robot's pose in an environment, typically within a given map or a similar representation.	Semantic Scholar
Different methods have been proposed to address this localization problem for robots with limited sensing.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a localization method for a robot equipped with only a contact sensor and a clock.	Semantic Scholar
We make the limits of localization accuracy precise by establishing the fundamental limits imposed by symmetry as revealed by the robot's sensors.	Semantic Scholar
Our method is based on finding periodic cycles and transient trajectories of the robot path as it bounces within an environment filled with obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the cycles and transient trajectories, space-efficient and automata-based combinatorial filters are synthesized to solve localization problems modulo symmetries.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results from multiple simulations and from real robot demonstrations attest to the feasibility and practicability of our method.	Semantic Scholar
Dependency quantified Boolean formulas (DQBF) and QBF dependency schemes have been treated separately in the literature, even though both treatments extend QBF by replacing the linear order of the quantifier prefix with a partial order.	Semantic Scholar
We propose to merge the two, by reinterpreting a dependency scheme as a mapping from QBF into DQBF.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach offers a fresh insight on the nature of soundness in proof systems for QBF with dependency schemes, in which a natural property called ‘full exhibition’ is central.	Semantic Scholar
We apply our approach to QBF proof systems from two distinct paradigms, termed ‘universal reduction’ and ‘universal expansion’.	Semantic Scholar
We show that full exhibition is sufficient (but not necessary) for soundness in universal reduction systems for QBF with dependency schemes, whereas for expansion systems the same property characterises soundness exactly.	Semantic Scholar
We prove our results by investigating DQBF proof systems, and then employing our reinterpretation of dependency schemes.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we show that the reflexive resolution path dependency scheme is fully exhibited, thereby proving a conjecture of Slivovsky.	Semantic Scholar
The purpose of this work is to highlight the paramount importance of <italic>representing</italic> and <italic> quantifying</italic> uncertainty to correctly report the associated confidence of the robot's location estimate at each time step along its trajectory and therefore decide the correct course of action in an active SLAM mission.	Semantic Scholar
We analyze the monotonicity property of different decision-making criteria, both in 2-D and 3-D, with respect to the representation of uncertainty and of the orientation of the robot's pose.	Semantic Scholar
Monotonicity, the property that uncertainty increases as the robot moves, is essential for adequate decision making.	Semantic Scholar
We analytically show that, by using differential representations to propagate spatial uncertainties, monotonicity is preserved for all optimality criteria, <italic>A-opt</italic>, <italic>D-opt</italic>, and <italic>E-opt</italic>, and for Shannon's entropy.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that monotonicity does not hold for any criteria in absolute representations using Roll-Pitch-Yaw and Euler angles.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, using unit quaternions in absolute representations, the only criteria that preserve monotonicity are <italic>D-opt</italic> and Shannon's entropy.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we explore the coexistence and dynamical behaviors of multiple equilibrium points for fractional-order competitive neural networks with Gaussian activation functions.	Semantic Scholar
By virtue of the geometrical properties of activation functions, the fixed point theorem and the theory of fractional-order differential equation, some sufficient conditions are established to guarantee that such n-neuron neural networks have exactly 3k equilibrium points with 0≤k≤n, among which 2k equilibrium points are locally Mittag-Leffler stable.	Semantic Scholar
The obtained results cover both multistability and mono-stability of fractional-order neural networks and integer-order neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
Two illustrative examples with their computer simulations are presented to verify the theoretical analysis.	Semantic Scholar
Specialization and hierarchical organization are important features of efficient collaboration in economical, artificial, and biological systems.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we investigate the hypothesis that both features can be explained by the fact that each entity of such a system is limited in a certain way.	Semantic Scholar
We propose an information-theoretic approach based on a free energy principle in order to computationally analyze systems of bounded rational agents that deal with such limitations optimally.	Semantic Scholar
We find that specialization allows a focus on fewer tasks, thus leading to a more efficient execution, but in turn, it requires coordination in hierarchical structures of specialized experts and coordinating units.	Semantic Scholar
Our results suggest that hierarchical architectures of specialized units at lower levels that are coordinated by units at higher levels are optimal, given that each unit's information-processing capability is limited and conforms to constraints on complexity costs.	Semantic Scholar
We tackle the task of dense 3D reconstruction from RGB-D data.	Semantic Scholar
Contrary to the majority of existing methods, we focus not only on trajectory estimation accuracy, but also on reconstruction precision.	Semantic Scholar
The key technique is SDF-2-SDF registration, which is a correspondence-free, symmetric, dense energy minimization method, performed via the direct voxel-wise difference between a pair of signed distance fields.	Semantic Scholar
It has a wider convergence basin than traditional point cloud registration and cloud-to-volume alignment techniques.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, its formulation allows for straightforward incorporation of photometric and additional geometric constraints.	Semantic Scholar
We employ SDF-2-SDF registration in two applications.	Semantic Scholar
First, we perform small-to-medium scale object reconstruction entirely on the CPU.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, the camera is tracked frame-to-frame in real time.	Semantic Scholar
Then, the initial pose estimates are refined globally in a lightweight optimization framework, which does not involve a pose graph.	Semantic Scholar
We combine these procedures into our second, fully real-time application for larger-scale object reconstruction and SLAM.	Semantic Scholar
It is implemented as a hybrid system, whereby tracking is done on the GPU, while refinement runs concurrently over batches on the CPU.	Semantic Scholar
To bound memory and runtime footprints, registration is done over a fixed number of limited-extent volumes, anchored at geometry-rich locations.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation of both trajectory accuracy and model fidelity on several public RGB-D datasets, acquired with various quality sensors, demonstrates higher precision than related techniques.	Semantic Scholar
We present a rapidly exploring-random-tree-based parallel motion planning algorithm that uses the maximal Poisson-disk sampling scheme.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach exploits the free-disk property of the maximal Poisson-disk samples to generate nodes and perform tree expansion.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we use an adaptive scheme to generate more samples in challenging regions of the configuration space.	Semantic Scholar
The Poisson-disk sampling results in improved parallel performance and we highlight the performance benefits on multicore central processing units as well as manycore graphics processing units on different benchmarks.	Semantic Scholar
Exoskeletons are increasingly interesting for human assistance applications ranging from rehabilitation to force enhancement.	Semantic Scholar
However, today's exoskeletons are relatively slow and lack the mechanical transparency required to complete several daily tasks, mainly due to their bulky and non-back-drivable actuation mechanisms.	Semantic Scholar
To improve upon conventional exoskeleton designs, this letter presents a novel power-distribution system that combines magnetorheological (MR) clutches and low-friction hydrostatic transmissions using rolling diaphragms.	Semantic Scholar
In such a system, MR clutches are used to rapidly modulate the torque provided from a centralized power source and distribute it to each joint through a high-bandwidth, back-drivable, and low-inertia transmission.	Semantic Scholar
The main objective of this letter is to investigate the transparency performance of the MR-hydrostatic power distribution in terms of its force-bandwidth and back-drivability with the aim of being used in future exoskeletons.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments with a custom one degree-of-freedom haptic joint are supported by an analytical model that demonstrates the high bandwidth (>40 Hz) and good backdrivability (2–11% of peak force) of an MR-hydrostatic system.	Semantic Scholar
This letter introduces a single-port robotic platform for transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEMS).	Semantic Scholar
Two robotically controlled articulated surgical instruments are inserted via a transanal approach to perform submucosal or full-thickness dissection.	Semantic Scholar
This system is intended to replace the conventional TEMS approach that uses manual laparoscopic instruments.	Semantic Scholar
The new system is based on master–slave robotically controlled tele-manipulation.	Semantic Scholar
The slave robot comprises a support arm that is mounted on the operating table, supporting a surgical port and a robotic platform that drives the surgical instruments.	Semantic Scholar
The master console includes a pair of haptic devices, as well as a three-dimensional display showing the live video stream of a stereo endoscope inserted through the surgical port.	Semantic Scholar
The surgical instrumentation consists of energy delivery devices, graspers, and needle drivers allowing a full TEMS procedure to be performed.	Semantic Scholar

In historical manuscripts, humans can detect handwritten words, lines, and decorations with lightness even if they do not know the language or the script.	Semantic Scholar
Yet for automatic processing this task has proven elusive, especially in the case of handwritten documents with complex layouts, which is why semiautomatic methods that integrate the human user into the process are needed.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we introduce a user-centered segmentation method based on document graphs and scribbling interaction.	Semantic Scholar
The graphs capture a sparse representation of the document's structure that can then be edited by the user with a stylus on a touch-sensitive screen.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate the proposed method on a newly introduced database of historical manuscripts with complex layout and demonstrate, first, that the document graphs are already close to the desired segmentation and, second, that scribbling allows a natural and efficient interaction.	Semantic Scholar
Recent developments in sensors, global positioning system devices, and smart phones have increased the availability of spatiotemporal data streams.	Semantic Scholar
Developing models for mining such streams is challenged by the huge amount of data that cannot be stored in the memory, the high arrival speed, and the dynamic changes in the data distribution.	Semantic Scholar
Density estimation is an important technique in stream mining for a wide variety of applications.	Semantic Scholar
The construction of kernel density estimators is well studied and documented.	Semantic Scholar
However, existing techniques are either expensive or inaccurate and unable to capture the changes in the data distribution.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a method called KDE-Track to estimate the density of spatiotemporal data streams.	Semantic Scholar
KDE-Track can efficiently estimate the density function with linear time complexity using interpolation on a kernel model, which is incrementally updated upon the arrival of new samples from the stream.	Semantic Scholar
We also propose an accurate and efficient method for selecting the bandwidth value for the kernel density estimator, which increases its accuracy significantly.	Semantic Scholar
Both theoretical analysis and experimental validation show that KDE-Track outperforms a set of baseline methods on the estimation accuracy and computing time of complex density structures in data streams.	Semantic Scholar
CAD/CAM approaches have been used in the manufacturing industry for a long time, and their use in robotic systems is becoming more popular.	Semantic Scholar
One common element in these approaches is the use of geometric constraints to define relative object poses.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, approaches for solving these geometric constraints are critical to their performance.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present an exact solver for geometric constraints.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach is based on mathematical models of constraints and geometric properties of constraint nullspaces.	Semantic Scholar
Our constraint solver supports nonlinear constraints with inequalities, and also mixed transformation manifolds, i.e., cases where the rotation and translation components of the constraints are not independent.	Semantic Scholar
Through several applications, we show how inequality constraints and mixed transformation manifolds increase the expressive power of constraint-based task definitions.	Semantic Scholar
The exact solver provides repeatable solutions with deterministic runtimes and our experiments show that it is also much faster than comparable iterative solvers.	Semantic Scholar
Trajectory tracking is a major challenge for UAVs.	Semantic Scholar
The more complex the trajectory is, the more accurate tracking is required with minimum divergence from the trajectory.	Semantic Scholar
Apart from active trajectory tracking mechanisms, current solutions to accurate trajectory tracking in narrow areas require low speed motions.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a systematic design methodology using centralised feedforward/feedback control architecture for advanced trajectory tracking without compromising the speed of the vehicle.	Semantic Scholar
Using the H∞ norm as a measure for the design criteria, the proposed method proves fast tracking with no overshooting and less actuators energy compared with single degree-of-freedom feedback control method.	Semantic Scholar
The results are verified using simulations for two systems: a tri-rotor VTOL UAV (fully actuated system), and a quadrotor trainer (over-actuated system).	Semantic Scholar
A synthetic fiber rope is potentially capable of replacing a stainless steel wire rope because it is light weight, and has high tensile strength and flexibility.	Semantic Scholar
In order to exploit the maximum tensile strength of the rope, a terminal fixation method with a sufficient fixing force is essential.	Semantic Scholar
However, this is extremely difficult in the case of synthetic fiber ropes due to their small friction coefficients.	Semantic Scholar
This letter proposes a new terminal fixation method combined with a grooved pulley and pin.	Semantic Scholar
The grooved pulley is utilized in order to increase the friction between the synthetic fiber rope and the pulley, and the rope is wound around the grooved pulley.	Semantic Scholar
The extremity of the rope is fixed at a pin by hanging a loop with a figure-eight knot.	Semantic Scholar
The appropriate groove shape is found experimentally and it is confirmed that our method achieves maximum fixation force of 91.3% against the rope breaking force.	Semantic Scholar
We provide implementations examples for a long-reach tendon-driven manipulator.	Semantic Scholar
Exploiting RGB-D data by means of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is at the core of a number of robotics applications, including object detection, scene semantic segmentation, and grasping.	Semantic Scholar
Most existing approaches, however, exploit RGB-D data by simply considering depth as an additional input channel for the network.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we show that the performance of deep architectures can be boosted by introducing DaConv, a novel, general-purpose CNN block which exploits depth to learn scale-aware feature representations.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the benefits of DaConv on a variety of robotics oriented tasks, involving affordance detection, object coordinate regression, and contour detection in RGB-D images.	Semantic Scholar
In each of these experiments we show the potential of the proposed block and how it can be readily integrated into existing CNN architectures.	Semantic Scholar
The scientific literature on automated gait analysis for human recognition has grown dramatically over the past 15 years.	Semantic Scholar
A number of sensing modalities including those based on vision, sound, pressure, and accelerometry have been used to capture gait information.	Semantic Scholar
For each of these modalities, a number of methods have been developed to extract and compare human gait information, resulting in different sets of features.	Semantic Scholar
This paper provides an extensive overview of the various types of features that have been utilized for each sensing modality and their relationship to the appearance and biomechanics of gait.	Semantic Scholar
The features considered in this work include (a) static and dynamic (temporal) features; (b) model-based and model-free visual features; (c) ground reaction force-based and finely resolved underfoot pressure features; (d) wearable sensor features; and (e) acoustic features.	Semantic Scholar
We also review the factors that impact gait recognition, and discuss recent work on gait spoofing and obfuscation.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we enumerate the challenges and open problems in the field of gait recognition.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a new method for motion planning under differential constraints by incorporating a numerically solved discretized representation of reachable state space for faster state sampling and nearest neighbor searching.	Semantic Scholar
The reachable state space is solved for offline and stored into a “reachable map” which can be efficiently applied in online planning.	Semantic Scholar
State sampling is performed only over states encompassed by the reachable map to reduce the number of unsuccessful motion validity checking queries.	Semantic Scholar
The nearest neighbor distance function is revised such that only reachable states are considered, with states which are unreachable or only reachable beyond a designated time horizon disregarded.	Semantic Scholar
This method is generalized for application to any control system, and thus can be used for vehicle models where analytical solutions cannot be found.	Semantic Scholar
Greater improvement is expected for more constrained systems where motion checking cost is relatively high.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation results are discussed for case studies on a holonomic model and a Dubins car model, both with maximum speed limitation and time included as a dimension in the configuration space, where planning speed (measured by tree growth rate) can be improved through reachability guidance in each system by at least a factor of 3 and 9, respectively.

We explore the theory of regular language representations in the constructive type theory of Coq.	Semantic Scholar
We cover various forms of automata (deterministic, nondeterministic, one-way, two-way), regular expressions, and the logic WS1S.	Semantic Scholar
We give translations between all representations, show decidability results, and provide operations for various closure properties.	Semantic Scholar
Our results include a constructive decidability proof for the logic WS1S, a constructive refinement of the Myhill-Nerode characterization of regularity, and translations from two-way automata to one-way automata with verified upper bounds for the increase in size.	Semantic Scholar
All results are verified with an accompanying Coq development of about 3000 lines.	Semantic Scholar

The detection of negative emotions through daily activities such as writing and drawing is useful for promoting wellbeing.	Semantic Scholar
The spread of human–machine interfaces such as tablets makes the collection of handwriting and drawing samples easier.	Semantic Scholar
In this context, we present a first publicly available database which relates emotional states to handwriting and drawing, that we call EMOTHAW (EMOTion recognition from HAndWriting and draWing).	Semantic Scholar
This database includes samples of 129 participants whose emotional states, namely anxiety, depression, and stress, are assessed by the Depression–Anxiety–Stress Scales (DASS) questionnaire.	Semantic Scholar
Seven tasks are recorded through a digitizing tablet: pentagons and house drawing, words copied in handprint, circles and clock drawing, and one sentence copied in cursive writing.	Semantic Scholar
Records consist in pen positions, on-paper and in-air, time stamp, pressure, pen azimuth, and altitude.	Semantic Scholar
We report our analysis on this database.	Semantic Scholar
From collected data, we first compute measurements related to timing and ductus.	Semantic Scholar
We compute separate measurements according to the position of the writing device: on paper or in-air.	Semantic Scholar
We analyze and classify this set of measurements (referred to as features) using a random forest approach.	Semantic Scholar
This latter is a machine learning method [1], based on an ensemble of decision trees, which includes a feature ranking process.	Semantic Scholar
We use this ranking process to identify the features which best reveal a targeted emotional state.	Semantic Scholar
We then build random forest classifiers associated with each emotional state.	Semantic Scholar
We provide accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity evaluation measures obtained from cross-validation experiments.	Semantic Scholar
Our results show that anxiety and stress recognition perform better than depression recognition.	Semantic Scholar
In pioneering work, Senders (1983) tasked five participants to watch a bank of six dials, and found that glance rates and times glanced at dials increase linearly as a function of the frequency bandwidth of the dial's pointer.	Semantic Scholar
Senders did not record the angle of the pointers synchronously with eye movements, and so could not assess participants’ visual sampling behavior in regard to the pointer state.	Semantic Scholar
Because the study of Senders has been influential but never repeated, we replicated and extended it by assessing the relationship between visual sampling and pointer state, using modern eye-tracking equipment.	Semantic Scholar
Eye tracking was performed with 86 participants who watched seven 90-second videos, each video showing six dials with moving pointers.	Semantic Scholar
Participants had to press the spacebar when any of the six pointers crossed a threshold.	Semantic Scholar
Our results showed a close resemblance to Senders’ original results.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, we found that participants did not behave in accordance with a periodic sampling model, but rather were conditional samplers, in that the probability of looking at a dial was contingent on pointer angle and velocity.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we found that participants sampled more in agreement with Nyquist sampling when the high bandwidth dials were placed in the middle of the bank rather than at its outer edges.	Semantic Scholar
We observed results consistent with the saliency, effort, expectancy, and value model and conclude that human sampling of multidegree of freedom systems should not only be modeled in terms of bandwidth but also in terms of saliency and effort.	Semantic Scholar
The computer vision community is currently focusing on solving action recognition problems in real videos, which contain thousands of samples with many challenges.	Semantic Scholar
In this process, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (D-CNNs) have played a significant role in advancing the state-of-the-art in various vision-based action recognition systems.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, the introduction of residual connections in conjunction with a more traditional CNN model in a single architecture called Residual Network (ResNet) has shown impressive performance and great potential for image recognition tasks.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we investigate and apply deep ResNets for human action recognition using skeletal data provided by depth sensors.	Semantic Scholar
Firstly, the 3D coordinates of the human body joints carried in skeleton sequences are transformed into image-based representations and stored as RGB images.	Semantic Scholar
These color images are able to capture the spatial-temporal evolutions of 3D motions from skeleton sequences and can be efficiently learned by D-CNNs.	Semantic Scholar
We then propose a novel deep learning architecture based on ResNets to learn features from obtained color-based representations and classify them into action classes.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method is evaluated on three challenging benchmark datasets including MSR Action 3D, KARD, and NTU-RGB+D datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for all these benchmarks whilst requiring less computation resource.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the proposed method surpasses previous approaches by a significant margin of 3.4% on MSR Action 3D dataset, 0.67% on KARD dataset, and 2.5% on NTURGB+D dataset.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, social networks have witnessed a massive surge in popularity.	Semantic Scholar
A key issue in social network research is network evolution analysis, which assumes that all the autonomous nodes in a social network follow uniform evolution mechanisms.	Semantic Scholar
However, different nodes in a social network should have different evolution mechanisms to generate different edges.	Semantic Scholar
This is proposed as the underlying idea to ensure the nodes’ evolution diversity in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach involves identifying the micro-level node evolution that generates different edges by introducing the existing link prediction methods from the perspectives of nodes.	Semantic Scholar
We also propose the edge generation coefficient to evaluate the extent to which an edge's generation can be explained by a link prediction method.	Semantic Scholar
To quantify the nodes’ evolution diversity, we define the diverse evolution distance.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, a diverse node adaption algorithm is proposed to indirectly analyze the evolution of the entire network based on the nodes’ evolution diversity.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on disparate real-world networks demonstrate that the introduction of the nodes’ evolution diversity is important and beneficial for analyzing the network evolution.	Semantic Scholar
The diverse node adaption algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art link prediction algorithms in terms of both accuracy and universality.	Semantic Scholar
The greater the nodes’ evolution diversity, the more obvious its advantages.	Semantic Scholar

Self-organized criticality (SOC) and stochastic oscillations (SOs) are two theoretically contradictory phenomena that are suggested to coexist in the brain.	Semantic Scholar
Recently it has been shown that an accumulation-release process like sandpile dynamics can generate SOC and SOs simultaneously.	Semantic Scholar
We considered the effect of the network structure on this coexistence and showed that the sandpile dynamics on a small-world network can produce two power law regimes along with two groups of SOs—two peaks in the power spectrum of the generated signal simultaneously.	Semantic Scholar
We also showed that external stimuli in the sandpile dynamics do not affect the coexistence of SOC and SOs but increase the frequency of SOs, which is consistent with our knowledge of the brain.	Semantic Scholar
Jitter-type spike resampling methods are routinely applied in neurophysiology for detecting temporal structure in spike trains (point processes).	Semantic Scholar
Several variations have been proposed.	Semantic Scholar
The concern has been raised, based on numerical experiments involving Poisson spike processes, that such procedures can be conservative.	Semantic Scholar
We study the issue and find it can be resolved by reemphasizing the distinction between spike-centered (basic) jitter and interval jitter.	Semantic Scholar
Focusing on spiking processes with no temporal structure, interval jitter generates an exact hypothesis test, guaranteeing valid conclusions.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast, such a guarantee is not available for spike-centered jitter.	Semantic Scholar
We construct explicit examples in which spike-centered jitter hallucinates temporal structure, in the sense of exaggerated false-positive rates.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we illustrate numerically that Poisson approximations to jitter computations, while computationally efficient, can also result in inaccurate hypothesis tests.	Semantic Scholar
We highlight the value of classical statistical frameworks for guiding the design and interpretation of spike resampling methods.	Semantic Scholar
We present a control framework for optimizing image quality during robotic ultrasound acquisitions.	Semantic Scholar
The quality of the ultrasound signal across the field of view is represented by a confidence map that is computed online from the B-mode frames, following a model of sound propagation.	Semantic Scholar
Moments extracted from this confidence map are used to design a control law for optimizing imaging quality, based on the task function approach.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed confidence control is combined with force and position control to build two illustrative applications.	Semantic Scholar
First, we use force control and confidence control in order to maintain a correct pressure and a good orientation of the probe during teleoperation.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, control is shared between a human operator and the robot.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we add an automatic positioning task, so that the quality is optimized while maintaining a target in the image center.	Semantic Scholar
We show experimentally that confidence-driven control can effectively optimize the acoustic window in real time.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we show that it can improve the tracking robustness, by preventing the target from being shadowed.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we present the results of experiments performed on a human volunteer.	Semantic Scholar
Lifelong learning is fundamental in autonomous robotics for the acquisition and fine-tuning of knowledge through experience.	Semantic Scholar
However, conventional deep neural models for action recognition from videos do not account for lifelong learning but rather learn a batch of training data with a predefined number of action classes and samples.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, there is the need to develop learning systems with the ability to incrementally process available perceptual cues and to adapt their responses over time.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a self-organizing neural architecture for incrementally learning to classify human actions from video sequences.	Semantic Scholar
The architecture comprises growing self-organizing networks equipped with recurrent neurons for processing time-varying patterns.	Semantic Scholar
We use a set of hierarchically arranged recurrent networks for the unsupervised learning of action representations with increasingly large spatiotemporal receptive fields.	Semantic Scholar
Lifelong learning is achieved in terms of prediction-driven neural dynamics in which the growth and the adaptation of the recurrent networks are driven by their capability to reconstruct temporally ordered input sequences.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on a classification task using two action benchmark datasets show that our model is competitive with state-of-the-art methods for batch learning also when a significant number of sample labels are missing or corrupted during training sessions.	Semantic Scholar
Additional experiments show the ability of our model to adapt to non-stationary input avoiding catastrophic interference.	Semantic Scholar
unknown	Semantic Scholar
We consider the problem of classifying data manifolds where each manifold represents invariances that are parameterized by continuous degrees of freedom.	Semantic Scholar
Conventional data augmentation methods rely on sampling large numbers of training examples from these manifolds.	Semantic Scholar
Instead, we propose an iterative algorithm, MCP, based on a cutting plane approach that efficiently solves a quadratic semi-infinite programming problem to find the maximum margin solution.	Semantic Scholar
We provide a proof of convergence as well as a polynomial bound on the number of iterations required for a desired tolerance in the objective function.	Semantic Scholar
The efficiency and performance of MCP are demonstrated in high-dimensional simulations and on image manifolds generated from the ImageNet data set.	Semantic Scholar
Our results indicate that MCP is able to rapidly learn good classifiers and shows superior generalization performance compared with conventional maximum margin methods using data augmentation methods.	Semantic Scholar
Searching and tracking people in crowded urban areas where they can be occluded by static or dynamic obstacles is an important behavior for social robots which assist humans in urban outdoor environments.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we propose a method that can handle in real-time searching and tracking people using a Highest Belief Particle Filter Searcher and Tracker.	Semantic Scholar
It makes use of a modified Particle Filter (PF), which, in contrast to other methods, can do both searching and tracking of a person under uncertainty, with false negative detections, lack of a person detection, in continuous space and real-time.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, this method uses dynamic obstacles to improve the predicted possible location of the person.	Semantic Scholar
Comparisons have been made with our previous method, the Adaptive Highest Belief Continuous Real-time POMCP Follower, in different conditions and with dynamic obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
Real-life experiments have been done during two weeks with a mobile service robot in two urban environments of Barcelona with other people walking around.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, synchronization of stochastic reaction-diffusion neural networks with Dirichlet boundary conditions and unbounded discrete time-varying delays is investigated.	Semantic Scholar
By virtue of theories of partial differential equations, inequality methods, and stochastic analysis techniques, pth moment exponential synchronization and almost sure exponential synchronization of the underlying neural networks are developed.	Semantic Scholar
The obtained results in this study enhance and generalize some earlier ones.	Semantic Scholar

Compressive sensing, matrix rank optimization and Robust PCA-based matrix decomposition have an increasing number of non-convex approaches for optimizing the ideal `0-norm sparsity.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a novel online non-convex `pnorm based Robust PCA (OLP-RPCA) approach, where 0 < p < 1.	Semantic Scholar
OLP-RPCA is developed from the offline version LP-RPCA.	Semantic Scholar
Our LP-RPCA method uses a new objective function in the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework to efficiently solve the Robust PCA problem.	Semantic Scholar
More importantly, our OLP-RPCA method can achieve real-time performance on large-scale data without parallelizing or implementing on a graphics processing unit.	Semantic Scholar
We mathematically and empirically show that the computational complexity of our OLP-RPCA algorithm is linear in both the sample dimension and the number of samples.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approaches are evaluated in various applications including Gaussian/non-Gaussian image denoising, face modeling, real-time background subtraction and video inpainting and compared against numerous state-of-the-art low-rank minimization methods to demonstrate the robustness of our algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
This paper shows that echo state networks are universal uniform approximants in the context of discrete-time fading memory filters with uniformly bounded inputs defined on negative infinite times.	Semantic Scholar
This result guarantees that any fading memory input/output system in discrete time can be realized as a simple finite-dimensional neural network-type state-space model with a static linear readout map.	Semantic Scholar
This approximation is valid for infinite time intervals.	Semantic Scholar
The proof of this statement is based on fundamental results, also presented in this work, about the topological nature of the fading memory property and about reservoir computing systems generated by continuous reservoir maps.	Semantic Scholar
A recurring problem in controlling the attitude of miniature/micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) is the presence of an unknown atmospheric wind.	Semantic Scholar
Wind directly affects the vehicle's translational variables, namely the airspeed, angle-of-attack, and sideslip angle, all three of which are important variables in the equations that govern a fixed wing aircraft's aerodynamics.	Semantic Scholar
Consequently, wind exerts a major influence on the overall dynamics of an MAV.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we assume a knowledge of airspeed and describe a Lyapunov-based nonlinear estimation and control method that estimates the effects of angle-of-attack and sideslip on the vehicle's attitude, and at the same time controls the attitude to track a desired quaternion trajectory.	Semantic Scholar
This makes it possible to design an attitude control module that does not rely upon a knowledge of the individual components of the vehicle's translational velocity.	Semantic Scholar
The decomposition of the measured airspeed into the individual components is accomplished by the controller itself, in the form of an estimation of the angle-of-attack and the sideslip angle.	Semantic Scholar
We prove that, under quite general conditions, we can achieve asymptotic tracking of the attitude to the desired trajectory and also estimate how the attitude dynamics are affected by unpredictable disturbances in the angle-of-attack and sideslip angle.	Semantic Scholar
The problem of counting the number of solutions of a DNF formula, also called #DNF, is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence with applications in diverse domains ranging from network reliability to probabilistic databases.	Semantic Scholar
Owing to the intractability of the exact variant, efforts have focused on the design of approximate techniques for #DNF.	Semantic Scholar
Consequently, several Fully Polynomial Randomized Approximation Schemes (FPRASs) based on Monte Carlo techniques have been proposed.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, it was discovered that hashing-based techniques too lend themselves to FPRASs for #DNF.	Semantic Scholar
Despite significant improvements, the complexity of the hashing-based FPRAS is still worse than that of the best Monte Carlo FPRAS by polylog factors.	Semantic Scholar
Two questions were left unanswered in previous works: Can the complexity of the hashing-based techniques be improved?	Semantic Scholar
How do the various approaches stack up against each other empirically?	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we first propose a new search procedure for the hashing-based FPRAS that removes the polylog factors from its time complexity.	Semantic Scholar
We then present the first empirical study of runtime behavior of different FPRASs for #DNF.	Semantic Scholar
The result of our study produces a nuanced picture.	Semantic Scholar
First of all, we observe that there is no single best algorithm that outperforms all others for all classes of formulas and input parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Second, we observe that the algorithm with one of the worst time complexities solves the largest number of benchmarks.	Semantic Scholar
OpenPHRI is a C++/Python general-purpose software scheme with several built-in safety measures designed to ease robot programming for physical human?robot interaction (pHRI) and collaboration.	Semantic Scholar

The OpenPHRI framework consists of a two-layer damping controller, depicted in Figure 1.	Semantic Scholar
This allows the user to provide compliance and other safety features at both the joint and task levels, depending on the application.	Semantic Scholar
We present a formally verified and executable on-the-fly LTL model checker that uses ample set partial order reduction.	Semantic Scholar
The verification is done using the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL and covers everything from the abstract correctness proof down to the generated SML code.	Semantic Scholar
Building on Doron Peled’s paper “Combining Partial Order Reductions with On-the-Fly Model-Checking”, we formally prove abstract correctness of ample set partial order reduction.	Semantic Scholar
This theorem is independent of the actual reduction algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
We then verify a reduction algorithm for a simple but expressive fragment of Promela.	Semantic Scholar
We use static partial order reduction, which allows separating the partial order reduction and the model checking algorithms regarding both the correctness proof and the implementation.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, the Cava model checker that we verified in previous work can be used as a back end with only minimal changes.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we generate executable SML code using a stepwise refinement approach.	Semantic Scholar
We test our model checker on some examples, observing the effectiveness of the partial order reduction algorithm.	Semantic Scholar

Binary undirected graphs are well established, but when these graphs are constructed, often a threshold is applied to a parameter describing the connection between two nodes.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, the use of weighted graphs is more appropriate.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we focus on weighted undirected graphs.	Semantic Scholar
This implies that we have to incorporate edge weights in the graph measures, which require generalizations of common graph metrics.	Semantic Scholar
After reviewing existing generalizations of the clustering coefficient and the local efficiency, we proposed new generalizations for these graph measures.	Semantic Scholar
To be able to compare different generalizations, a number of essential and useful properties were defined that ideally should be satisfied.	Semantic Scholar
We applied the generalizations to two real-world networks of different sizes.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, we found that not all existing generalizations satisfy all essential properties.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we determined the best generalization for the clustering coefficient and local efficiency based on their properties and the performance when applied to two networks.	Semantic Scholar
We found that the best generalization of the clustering coefficient is , defined in Miyajima and Sakuragawa (2014), while the best generalization of the local efficiency is , proposed in this letter.	Semantic Scholar
Depending on the application and the relative importance of sensitivity and robustness to noise, other generalizations may be selected on the basis of the properties investigated in this letter.	Semantic Scholar
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm to analyze data and recognize patterns.	Semantic Scholar
The standard SVM suffers from some limitations in nonlinear classification problems.	Semantic Scholar
To tackle these limitations, the nonlinear form of the SVM poses a modified machine based on the kernel functions or other nonlinear feature mappings obviating the mentioned imperfection.	Semantic Scholar
However, choosing an efficient kernel or feature mapping function is strongly dependent on data structure.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, a flexible feature mapping can be confidently applied in different types of data structures without challenging a kernel selection and its tuning.	Semantic Scholar
This paper introduces a new flexible feature mapping approach based on the Dirichlet distribution in order to develop an efficient SVM for nonlinear data structures.	Semantic Scholar
To determine the parameters of the Dirichlet mapping, a tuning technique is employed based on the maximum likelihood estimation and Newton's optimization method.	Semantic Scholar
The numerical results illustrate the superiority of the proposed machine in terms of the accuracy and relative error rate measures in comparison to the traditional ones.	Semantic Scholar
Assembly lines are cost efficient production systems that mass produce identical products.	Semantic Scholar
Due to customer demand, manufacturers use mixed model assembly lines to produce customized products that are not identical.	Semantic Scholar
To stay efficient, management decisions for the line such as number of workers and assembly task assignment to stations need to be optimized to increase throughput and decrease cost.	Semantic Scholar
In each station, the work to be done depends on the exact product configuration, and is not consistent across all products.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a mixed model line balancing integer program (IP) that considers parallel workers, zoning, task assignment, and ergonomic constraints with the objective of minimizing the number of workers.	Semantic Scholar
Upon observing the limitation of the IP, a Constraint Programming (CP) model is developed to solve larger assembly line balancing problems.	Semantic Scholar
Data from an automotive OEM are used to assess the performance of both the MIP and CP models, including sensitivity analysis to measure the computational cost of enabling the different constraints.	Semantic Scholar
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first paper to incorporate the different realistic mixed model assembly line constraints and develop a CP model based on the scheduling module of the IBM ILOG Optimizations Studio.	Semantic Scholar
Using the OEM data, we show that the CP model outperforms the IP model for bigger problems.	Semantic Scholar
Collision avoidance plays a crucial role in safe multirotor flight in cluttered environments.	Semantic Scholar
Even though a given reference trajectory is designed to be collision free, it might lead to collision due to imperfect tracking caused by external disturbances.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we tackle this problem by computing the forward reachable set (FRS), which is the set of positions and velocities that a multirotor can reach while following a reference trajectory due to tracking errors.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, if the FRS is computed before flight, we can utilize it to check the safety of a given trajectory in terms of collision avoidance.	Semantic Scholar
To compute a realistic FRS that covers an agile flight envelope, we consider first-order aerodynamic effects, which have the most salient influence on the vehicle.	Semantic Scholar
For computing FRS, we conduct a thorough stability analysis including these aerodynamic effects.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we present an FRS computation method that can easily be adapted to newly given reference trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
The presented method is validated by comparing the FRS with real flight data collected during agile and high-speed flight.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we compare the FRS computed with and without compensating for first-order aerodynamic effect to highlight their significance on the trajectory tracking performance.	Semantic Scholar
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to compute FRSs by incorporating first-order aerodynamic effects for multirotors.	Semantic Scholar
Estimating six degrees of freedom poses of a planar object from images is an important problem with numerous applications ranging from robotics to augmented reality.	Semantic Scholar
While the state-of-the-art Perspective-n-Point algorithms perform well in pose estimation, the success hinges on whether feature points can be extracted and matched correctly on target objects with rich texture.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we propose a two-step robust direct method for six-dimensional pose estimation that performs accurately on both textured and textureless planar target objects.	Semantic Scholar
First, the pose of a planar target object with respect to a calibrated camera is approximately estimated by posing it as a template matching problem.	Semantic Scholar
Second, each object pose is refined and disambiguated using a dense alignment scheme.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed direct pose estimation algorithm performs favorably against state-of-the-art feature-based approaches in terms of robustness and accuracy under varying conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we show that the proposed dense alignment scheme can also be used for accurate pose tracking in video sequences.	Semantic Scholar
We analyze algorithms for approximating a function f(x)=Φx mapping ℜd to ℜd using deep linear neural networks, that is, that learn a function h parameterized by matrices Θ1,,ΘL and defined by h(x)=ΘLΘL-1Θ1x.	Semantic Scholar
We focus on algorithms that learn through gradient descent on the population quadratic loss in the case that the distribution over the inputs is isotropic.	Semantic Scholar
We provide polynomial bounds on the number of iterations for gradient descent to approximate the least-squares matrix Φ, in the case where the initial hypothesis Θ1==ΘL=I has excess loss bounded by a small enough constant.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that gradient descent fails to converge for Φ, whose distance from the identity is a larger constant, and we show that some forms of regularization toward the identity in each layer do not help.	Semantic Scholar
If Φ is symmetric positive definite, we show that an algorithm that initializes Θi=I learns an ε-approximation of f using a number of updates polynomial in L, the condition number of Φ, and log(d/ε).	Semantic Scholar
In contrast, we show that if the least-squares matrix Φ is symmetric and has a negative eigenvalue, then all members of a class of algorithms that perform gradient descent with identity initialization, and optionally regularize toward the identity in each layer, fail to converge.	Semantic Scholar
We analyze an algorithm for the case that Φ satisfies u⊤Φu>0 for all u but may not be symmetric.	Semantic Scholar
This algorithm uses two regularizers: one that maintains the invariant u⊤ΘLΘL-1Θ1u>0 for all u and the other that “balances” Θ1,,ΘL so that they have the same singular values.	Semantic Scholar
Task engagement is defined as loadings on energetic arousal (affect), task motivation, and concentration (cognition) [1].	Semantic Scholar
It is usually challenging and expensive to label cognitive state data, and traditional computational models trained with limited label information for engagement assessment do not perform well because of overfitting.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we proposed two deep models (i.e., a deep classifier and a deep autoencoder) for engagement assessment with scarce label information.	Semantic Scholar
We recruited 15 pilots to conduct a 4-h flight simulation from Seattle to Chicago and recorded their electroencephalograph (EEG) signals during the simulation.	Semantic Scholar
Experts carefully examined the EEG signals and labeled 20 min of the EEG data for each pilot.	Semantic Scholar
The EEG signals were preprocessed and power spectral features were extracted.	Semantic Scholar
The deep models were pretrained by the unlabeled data and were fine-tuned by a different proportion of the labeled data (top 1%, 3%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%) to learn new representations for engagement assessment.	Semantic Scholar
The models were then tested on the remaining labeled data.	Semantic Scholar
We compared performances of the new data representations with the original EEG features for engagement assessment.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that the representations learned by the deep models yielded better accuracies for the six scenarios (77.09%, 80.45%, 83.32%, 85.74%, 85.78%, and 86.52%), based on different proportions of the labeled data for training, as compared with the corresponding accuracies (62.73%, 67.19%, 73.38%, 79.18%, 81.47%, and 84.92%) achieved by the original EEG features.	Semantic Scholar
Deep models are effective for engagement assessment especially when less label information was used for training.	Semantic Scholar
Query auto-completion (QAC) is widely used by modern search engines to assist users by predicting their intended queries.	Semantic Scholar
Most QAC approaches rely on deterministic batch learning algorithms trained from past query log data.	Semantic Scholar
However, query popularities keep changing all the time and QAC operates in a real-time scenario where users interact with the search engine continually.	Semantic Scholar
So, ideally, QAC must be timely and adaptive enough to reflect time-sensitive changes in an online fashion.	Semantic Scholar
Second, due to the vertical position bias, a query suggestion with a higher rank tends to attract more clicks regardless of user’s original intention.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, in the long run, it is important to place some lower ranked yet potentially more relevant queries to higher positions to collect more valuable user feedbacks.	Semantic Scholar
In order to tackle these issues, we propose to formulate QAC as a ranked Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) problem which enjoys theoretical soundness.	Semantic Scholar
To utilize prior knowledge from query logs, we propose to use Bayesian inference and Thompson Sampling to solve this MAB problem.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on large scale datasets show that our QAC algorithm has the capacity to adaptively learn temporal trends, and outperforms existing QAC algorithms in ranking qualities.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents an algorithm for solving the minimum-energy optimal control problem of conductance-based spiking neurons.	Semantic Scholar
The basic procedure is (1) to construct a conductance-based spiking neuron oscillator as an affine nonlinear system, (2) to formulate the optimal control problem of the affine nonlinear system as a boundary value problem based on Pontryagin's maximum principle, and (3) to solve the boundary value problem using the homotopy perturbation method.	Semantic Scholar
The construction of the minimum-energy optimal control in the framework of the homotopy perturbation technique is novel and valid for a broad class of nonlinear conductance-based neuron models.	Semantic Scholar
The applicability of our method in the FitzHugh-Nagumo and Hindmarsh-Rose models is validated by simulations.	Semantic Scholar
Multi-instance learning (MIL) is a useful tool for tackling labeling ambiguity in learning because it allows a bag of instances to share one label.	Semantic Scholar
Bag mapping transforms a bag into a single instance in a new space via instance selection and has drawn significant attention recently.	Semantic Scholar
To date, most existing work is based on the original space, using all instances inside each bag for bag mapping, and the selected instances are not directly tied to an MIL objective.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, it is difficult to guarantee the distinguishing capacity of the selected instances in the new bag mapping space.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a discriminative mapping approach for multi-instance learning (MILDM) that aims to identify the best instances to directly distinguish bags in the new mapping space.	Semantic Scholar
Accordingly, each instance bag can be mapped using the selected instances to a new feature space, and hence any generic learning algorithm, such as an instance-based learning algorithm, can be used to derive learning models for multi-instance classification.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments and comparisons on eight different types of real-world learning tasks (including 14 data sets) demonstrate that MILDM outperforms the state-of-the-art bag mapping multi-instance learning approaches.	Semantic Scholar
Results also confirm that MILDM achieves balanced performance between runtime efficiency and classification effectiveness.	Semantic Scholar
A typical goal of linear-supervised dimension reduction is to find a low-dimensional subspace of the input space such that the projected input variables preserve maximal information about the output variables.	Semantic Scholar
The dependence-maximization approach solves the supervised dimension-reduction problem through maximizing a statistical dependence between projected input variables and output variables.	Semantic Scholar
A well-known statistical dependence measure is mutual information (MI), which is based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence.	Semantic Scholar
However, it is known that the KL divergence is sensitive to outliers.	Semantic Scholar
Quadratic MI (QMI) is a variant of MI based on the distance, which is more robust against outliers than the KL divergence, and a computationally efficient method to estimate QMI from data, least squares QMI (LSQMI), has been proposed recently.	Semantic Scholar
For these reasons, developing a supervised dimension-reduction method based on LSQMI seems promising.	Semantic Scholar
However, not QMI itself but the derivative of QMI is needed for subspace search in linear-supervised dimension reduction, and the derivative of an accurate QMI estimator is not necessarily a good estimator of the derivative of QMI.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose to directly estimate the derivative of QMI without estimating QMI itself.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the direct estimation of the derivative of QMI is more accurate than the derivative of the estimated QMI.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we develop a linear-supervised dimension-reduction algorithm that efficiently uses the proposed derivative estimator and demonstrate through experiments that the proposed method is more robust against outliers than existing methods.	Semantic Scholar
Getting back to previously viewed web pages is a common yet uneasy task for users due to the large volume of personally accessed information on the web.	Semantic Scholar
This paper leverages human's natural recall process of using episodic and semantic memory cues to facilitate recall, and presents a personal web revisitation technique called  WebPagePrev through context and content keywords.	Semantic Scholar
Underlying techniques for context and content memories’ acquisition, storage, decay, and utilization for page re-finding are discussed.	Semantic Scholar
A relevance feedback mechanism is also involved to tailor to individual's memory strength and revisitation habits.	Semantic Scholar
Our 6-month user study shows that: (1) Compared with the existing web revisitation tool Memento, History List Searching method, and Search Engine method, the proposed WebPagePrev delivers the best re-finding quality in finding rate (92.10 percent), average F1-measure (0.4318), and average rank error (0.3145).	Semantic Scholar
(2) Our dynamic management of context and content memories including decay and reinforcement strategy can mimic users’ retrieval and recall mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
With relevance feedback, the finding rate of  WebPagePrev increases by 9.82 percent, average F1-measure increases by 47.09 percent, and average rank error decreases by 19.44 percent compared to stable memory management strategy.	Semantic Scholar
Among time, location, and activity context factors in WebPagePrev, activity is the best recall cue, and context+content based re-finding delivers the best performance, compared to context based re-finding and content based re-finding.	Semantic Scholar
This article proposes an architecture for an intelligent surveillance system, where the aim is to mitigate the burden on humans in conventional surveillance systems by incorporating intelligent interfaces, computer vision, and autonomous mobile robots.	Semantic Scholar
Central to the intelligent surveillance system is the application of research into planning and decision making in this novel context.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we describe the robot surveillance decision problem and explain how the integration of components in our system supports fully automated decision making.	Semantic Scholar
Several concrete scenarios deployed in real surveillance environments exemplify both the flexibility of our system to experiment with different representations and algorithms and the portability of our system into a variety of problem contexts.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, these scenarios demonstrate how planning enables robots to effectively balance surveillance objectives, autonomously performing the job of human patrols and responders.	Semantic Scholar
Although the theories of geometric algebra (GA) are widely applied in engineering design and analysis, the studies on their formalization have been scarcely conducted.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a relatively complete formalization of GA in HOL Light.	Semantic Scholar
Both algebraic and geometric parts of the GA theories are formalized successively.	Semantic Scholar
For the algebraic part, a uniform abstract product is proposed to facilitate the formalization of the three basic products based on the formal definition of multivectors with three types of metrics.	Semantic Scholar
For the geometric part, the formal formulation is provided for the blades and versors and their relations at first.	Semantic Scholar
Then, several commonly used specific spaces are formally represented in the theoretical framework of GA.	Semantic Scholar
The novelty of the present paper lies in two aspects: (a) the multivector type, (P,Q,R)geomalg, is defined and the definition provides the most important foundation for the formalization of geometric algebra, and (b) a procedure is developed for automatically proving the properties of GA operations.	Semantic Scholar
The present work improves the function of HOL Light and makes the GA-based formal analysis and verification more convenient.	Semantic Scholar
The end-points of a moving bar (intrinsic terminators) contain unambiguous information that can be used to extract the bar's correct direction of motion, regardless of the orientation of the bar.	Semantic Scholar
However, extrinsic terminators, formed at the intersection of two overlapping bars, can result in motion signals with conflicting directions compared to those of the intrinsic terminators.	Semantic Scholar
Using a computational model, we propose that interactions between form and motion information may assist neurons in the motion-specific regions of primate cortex to differentiate intrinsic from extrinsic terminators.	Semantic Scholar
The motion processing model has two stages.	Semantic Scholar
The first stage is a model of V1 complex neurons, including end-stopped neurons.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting first stage motion signals are transmitted to the second stage, which is a model of MT neurons.	Semantic Scholar
In the proposed model, MT neurons additionally receive form information from neurons in V1 that are not orientation or direction selective but respond strongly to the contrast of the stimulus.	Semantic Scholar
These neurons have polarity-dependent center-surround receptive fields, as found in layer 4 of V1 in primates.	Semantic Scholar
As the inhibitory surrounds of these neurons are less activated at the intrinsic terminators, the signals generated by the end-points of the objects are stronger than the signals from the extrinsic terminators, which are inhibited by strong suppression from the surround.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, the excitatory inputs received by integration MT neurons from center-surround V1 neurons enhance the unambiguous motion signals at the intrinsic terminators, which therefore dominate over the local motion signals generated at X-junctions.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that, despite the inability of V1 end-stopped neurons to distinguish between the two different types of terminators, center-surround V1 neurons provide the capacity for the second stage of the model to preferentially respond to the intrinsic terminators and, therefore, predict the true directions of the crossing bars.	Semantic Scholar
To accommodate structured approaches of neural computation, we propose a class of recurrent neural networks for indexing and storing sequences of symbols or analog data vectors.	Semantic Scholar
These networks with randomized input weights and orthogonal recurrent weights implement coding principles previously described in vector symbolic architectures (VSA) and leverage properties of reservoir computing.	Semantic Scholar
In general, the storage in reservoir computing is lossy, and crosstalk noise limits the retrieval accuracy and information capacity.	Semantic Scholar
A novel theory to optimize memory performance in such networks is presented and compared with simulation experiments.	Semantic Scholar
The theory describes linear readout of analog data and readout with winner-take-all error correction of symbolic data as proposed in VSA models.	Semantic Scholar
We find that diverse VSA models from the literature have universal performance properties, which are superior to what previous analyses predicted.	Semantic Scholar
Further, we propose novel VSA models with the statistically optimal Wiener filter in the readout that exhibit much higher information capacity, in particular for storing analog data.	Semantic Scholar
The theory we present also applies to memory buffers, networks with gradual forgetting, which can operate on infinite data streams without memory overflow.	Semantic Scholar
Interestingly, we find that different forgetting mechanisms, such as attenuating recurrent weights or neural nonlinearities, produce very similar behavior if the forgetting time constants are matched.	Semantic Scholar
Such models exhibit extensive capacity when their forgetting time constant is optimized for given noise conditions and network size.	Semantic Scholar
These results enable the design of new types of VSA models for the online processing of data streams.	Semantic Scholar
With the increasing availability of moving-object tracking data, trajectory search is increasingly important.	Semantic Scholar
We propose and investigate a novel query type named trajectory search by regions of interest (TSR query).	Semantic Scholar
Given an argument set of trajectories, a TSR query takes a set of regions of interest as a parameter and returns the trajectory in the argument set with the highest spatial-density correlation to the query regions.	Semantic Scholar
This type of query is useful in many popular applications such as trip planning and recommendation, and location based services in general.	Semantic Scholar
TSR query processing faces three challenges: how to model the spatial-density correlation between query regions and data trajectories, how to effectively prune the search space, and how to effectively schedule multiple so-called query sources.	Semantic Scholar
To tackle these challenges, a series of new metrics are defined to model spatial-density correlations.	Semantic Scholar
An efficient trajectory search algorithm is developed that exploits upper and lower bounds to prune the search space and that adopts a query-source selection strategy, as well as integrates a heuristic search strategy based on priority ranking to schedule multiple query sources.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of TSR query processing is studied in extensive experiments based on real and synthetic spatial data.	Semantic Scholar
The compliance of soft grippers contributes to their great superiority over rigid grippers in grasping irregularly shaped objects and forming soft contact with environments.	Semantic Scholar
Due to a relatively small pressure, soft grippers lack the stiffness required for wider applications.	Semantic Scholar
Particle jamming has been frequently reported as a means of stiffness control.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike previous research using vacuum for particle jamming, this paper proposes a novel passive particle jamming principle that does not need any vacuum power or other control means.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method is by simply patching a silicone rubber soft actuator and a pack (made of strain-limiting membrane) of particles to form an integral gripping finger.	Semantic Scholar
The inflation of the soft actuator applies a pressure to the particle pack causing particles inside it to jam.	Semantic Scholar
A larger squeezing pressure will result in tighter particle jamming, thus increasing the stiffness of the finger.	Semantic Scholar
The stiffness of the finger is controllable as it is proportional to the actuator's air pressure, which has been verified by experiments in this research.	Semantic Scholar
The stiffness can increase more than six fold when air pressure changes from 20 to 80 kPa in the experimental studies.	Semantic Scholar
The reported discovery may enhance the capabilities of soft robotic grippers so that more robotic picking operations could be performed by soft grippers.	Semantic Scholar
This paper describes the development of a dual-arm robotic system for industrial human-robot collaboration.	Semantic Scholar
The robot demonstrator described here possesses multiple sensor modalities for the monitoring of the shared human-robot workspace and is equipped with the ability for real-time collision-free dual-arm manipulation.	Semantic Scholar
A whole-body control framework is used as a key control element which generates a coherent output signal for the robot’s joints given the multiple controller inputs, tasks’ priorities, physical constraints, and current situation.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, sets of controller-constraints combinations of the whole-body controller constitute the basic building blocks that describe actions of a high-level action plan to be sequentially executed.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the robotic system can be controlled in an intuitive manner via human gestures.	Semantic Scholar
These individual robotic capabilities are combined into an industrial demonstrator which is validated in a gearbox assembly station of a Volkswagen factory.	Semantic Scholar
The connection density of nearby neurons in the cortex has been observed to be around 0.1, whereas the longer-range connections are present with much sparser density (Kalisman, Silberberg, & Markram, 2005).	Semantic Scholar
We propose a memory association model that qualitatively explains these empirical observations.	Semantic Scholar
The model we consider is a multiassociative, sparse, Willshaw-like model consisting of binary threshold neurons and binary synapses.	Semantic Scholar
It uses recurrent synapses for iterative retrieval of stored memories.	Semantic Scholar
We quantify the usefulness of recurrent synapses by simulating the model for small network sizes and by doing a precise mathematical analysis for large network sizes.	Semantic Scholar
Given the network parameters, we can determine the precise values of recurrent and afferent synapse densities that optimize the storage capacity of the network.	Semantic Scholar
If the network size is like that of a cortical column, then the predicted optimal recurrent density lies in a range that is compatible with biological measurements.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we show that our model is able to surpass the standard Willshaw model in the multiassociative case if the information capacity is normalized per strong synapse or per bits required to store the model, as considered in Knoblauch, Palm, and Sommer (2010).	Semantic Scholar
In modern manufacturing plants, automation is widely adopted in the production phases, which leads to a high level of productivity and efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
However, the same level of automation is generally not achieved in logistics, typically performed by human operators and manually driven vehicles.	Semantic Scholar
In fact, even though automated guided vehicles (AGVs) have been used for a few decades for goods transportation in industrial environments [1], they do not yet represent a widespread solution and are typically applied only in specific scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
The paper considers a general neural networks model with variable-time impulses.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown that each solution of the system intersects with every discontinuous surface exactly once via several new well-proposed assumptions.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, based on the comparison principle, this paper shows that neural networks with variable-time impulse can be reduced to the corresponding neural network with fixed-time impulses under well-selected conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Meanwhile, the fixed-time impulsive systems can be regarded as the comparison system of the variable-time impulsive neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, a series of sufficient criteria are derived to ensure the existence and global exponential stability of periodic solution of variable-time impulsive neural networks, and to illustrate the same stability properties between variable-time impulsive neural networks and the fixed-time ones.	Semantic Scholar
The new criteria are established by applying Schaefer's fixed point theorem combined with the use of inequality technique.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, a numerical example is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed results.	Semantic Scholar
This paper investigates H∞ state estimation problem for a class of semi-Markovian jumping discrete-time neural networks model with event-triggered scheme and quantization.	Semantic Scholar
First, a new event-triggered communication scheme is introduced to determine whether or not the current sampled sensor data should be broad-casted and transmitted to the quantizer, which can save the limited communication resource.	Semantic Scholar
Second, a novel communication framework is employed by the logarithmic quantizer that quantifies and reduces the data transmission rate in the network, which apparently improves the communication efficiency of networks.	Semantic Scholar
Third, a stabilization criterion is derived based on the sufficient condition which guarantees a prescribed H∞ performance level in the estimation error system in terms of the linear matrix inequalities.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, numerical simulations are given to illustrate the correctness of the proposed scheme.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, the global exponential stability for recurrent neural networks (QVNNs) with asynchronous time delays is investigated in quaternion field.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the non-commutativity of quaternion multiplication resulting from Hamilton rules: ij=-ji=k, jk=-kj=i, ki=-ik=j, ijk=i2=j2=k2=-1, the QVNN is decomposed into four real-valued systems, which are studied separately.	Semantic Scholar
The exponential convergence is proved directly accompanied with the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium point to the consider systems.	Semantic Scholar
Combining with the generalized ∞-norm and Cauchy convergence property in the quaternion field, some sufficient conditions to guarantee the stability are established without using any Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and linear matrix inequality.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the results.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce FlyCam—a novel framework—for gimbal drone camera photography.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach abstracts the camera and the drone into a single flying camera object so that the user does not need to think about the drone movement and camera control as two separate actions.	Semantic Scholar
The camera is controlled from a single mobile device with six simple touch gestures such as rotate, move forward, yaw, and pitch.	Semantic Scholar
The gestures are implemented as seamless commands that combine the gimbal motion with the drone movement.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we add a sigmoidal motion response that compensates for abrupt drone swinging when moving horizontally.	Semantic Scholar
The smooth and simple camera movement has been evaluated by user study, where we asked 20 human subjects to mimic a photograph taken from a certain location.	Semantic Scholar
The users used both the default two joystick control and our new touch commands.	Semantic Scholar
Our results show that the new interaction performed better in both intuitiveness and easiness of navigation.	Semantic Scholar
The users spent less time on task, and the System Usability Scale index of our FlyCam method was 75.13, which is higher than the traditional dual joystick method that scored at 67.38.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the NASA task load index also showed that our method had lower workload than the traditional method.	Semantic Scholar
Wearable robots for lumbar support (hereafter, WRLS) can reduce the users’ lumbar stress and the risk of their back injuries.	Semantic Scholar
Although several products have already been put on the market, consumers and distributors have difficulty comparing their performance during assistance because they are currently not measured in a standardized manner.	Semantic Scholar
To solve this problem, this letter designs a standard performance test for WRLS.	Semantic Scholar
In the test, a testing machine makes reference movements imitating trunk movements with knee and hip joints during manual handling such as lowering down, holding, and raising up.	Semantic Scholar
Then, two performance metrics: Assistive Torque Index (ATI) and Lumbar Compression Reduction (LCR) are evaluated.	Semantic Scholar
The human experiments show that the reference movements are ergonomically plausible to mimic the actual motion of humans.	Semantic Scholar
The robot experiments indicate the feasibility of the test itself.	Semantic Scholar
The performance test has already become a part of JIS B 8456-1:2017 (a Japanese product standard for WRLS) and is to be a part of ISO 18646-4.	Semantic Scholar
We address the novel problem of detecting dynamic regions in CrowdCam images – a set of still images captured by a group of people.	Semantic Scholar
These regions capture the most interesting parts of the scene, and detecting them plays an important role in the analysis of visual data.	Semantic Scholar
Our method is based on the observation that matching static points must satisfy the epipolar geometry constraints, but computing exact matches is challenging.	Semantic Scholar
Instead, we compute the probability that a pixel has a match, not necessarily the correct one, along the corresponding epipolar line.	Semantic Scholar
The complement of this probability is not necessarily the probability of a dynamic point because of occlusions, noise, and matching errors.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, information from all pairs of images is aggregated to obtain a high quality dynamic probability map, per image.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on a broad range of settings; no prior knowledge about the scene, the camera characteristics or the camera locations is required.	Semantic Scholar
This letter introduces a method for recognizing geometric constraints from human demonstrations using both position and force measurements.	Semantic Scholar
Our key idea is that position information alone is insufficient to determine that a constraint is active and reaction forces must also be considered to correctly distinguish constraints from movements that just happen to follow a particular geometric shape.	Semantic Scholar
Our techniques can detect multiple plane, arc, and line constraints in a single demonstration.	Semantic Scholar
Our method uses the principle of virtual work to determine reaction forces from force and position data.	Semantic Scholar
It fits geometric constraints locally and clusters these over the whole motion for global constraint recognition.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental evaluations compare our force and position constraint inference technique with a similar position-only technique and conclude that force measurements are essential in eliminating false positive detections of constraints in free space.	Semantic Scholar
This paper describes a real-time feature-based stereo SLAM system that is robust and accurate in a wide variety of conditions –indoors, outdoors, with dynamic objects, changing light conditions, fast robot motions and large-scale loops.	Semantic Scholar
Our system follows a parallel-tracking-and-mapping strategy: a tracking thread estimates the camera pose at frame rate; and a mapping thread updates a keyframe-based map at a lower frequency.	Semantic Scholar
The stereo constraints of our system allow a robust initialization –avoiding the well-known bootstrapping problem in monocular systems– and the recovery of the real scale.	Semantic Scholar
Both aspects are essential for its practical use in real robotic systems that interact with the physical world.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we provide the implementation details, an exhaustive evaluation of the system in public datasets and a comparison of most state-of-the-art feature detectors and descriptors on the presented system.	Semantic Scholar
For the benefit of the community, its code for ROS (Robot Operating System) has been released.	Semantic Scholar
For tasks such as dressing assistance, robots should be able to adapt to different user morphologies, preferences and requirements.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a programming by demonstration method to efficiently learn and adapt such skills.	Semantic Scholar
Our method encodes sensory information (relative to the human user) and motor commands (relative to the robot actuation) as a joint distribution in a hidden semi-Markov model.	Semantic Scholar
The parameters of this model are learned from a set of demonstrations performed by a human.	Semantic Scholar
Each state of this model represents a sensorimotor pattern, whose sequencing can produce complex behaviors.	Semantic Scholar
This method, while remaining lightweight and simple, encodes both time-dependent and independent behaviors.	Semantic Scholar
It enables the sequencing of movement primitives in accordance to the current situation and user behavior.	Semantic Scholar
The approach is coupled with a task-parametrized model, allowing adaptation to different users’ morphologies, and with a minimal intervention controller, providing safe interaction with the user.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate the approach through several simulated tasks and two different dressing scenarios with a bi-manual Baxter robot.	Semantic Scholar
Multi-view learning (MVL) concentrates on the problem of learning from the data represented by multiple distinct feature sets.	Semantic Scholar
The consensus and complementarity principles play key roles in multi-view modeling.	Semantic Scholar
By exploiting the consensus principle or the complementarity principle among different views, various successful support vector machine (SVM)-based multi-view learning models have been proposed for performance improvement.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, a framework of learning using privileged information (LUPI) has been proposed to model data with complementary information.	Semantic Scholar
By bridging connections between the LUPI paradigm and multi-view learning, we have presented a privileged SVM-based two-view classification model, named PSVM-2V, satisfying both principles simultaneously.	Semantic Scholar
However, it can be further improved in these three aspects: (1) fully unleash the power of the complementary information among different views; (2) extend to multi-view case; (3) construct a more efficient optimization solver.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, in this paper, we propose an improved privileged SVM-based model for multi-view learning, termed as IPSVM-MV.	Semantic Scholar
It directly follows the standard LUPI model to fully utilize the multi-view complementary information; also it is a general model for multi-view scenario, and an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is employed to solve the corresponding optimization problem efficiently.	Semantic Scholar
Further more, we theoretically analyze the performance of IPSVM-MV from the viewpoints of the consensus principle and the generalization error bound.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on 75 binary data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method; here we mainly concentrate on two-view case to compare with state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
Within a given brain region, individual neurons exhibit a wide variety of different feature selectivities.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we investigated the impact of this extensive functional diversity on the population neural code.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach was to build optimal decoders to discriminate among stimuli using the spiking output of a real, measured neural population and compare its performance against a matched, homogeneous neural population with the same number of cells and spikes.	Semantic Scholar
Analyzing large populations of retinal ganglion cells, we found that the real, heterogeneous population can yield a discrimination error lower than the homogeneous population by several orders of magnitude and consequently can encode much more visual information.	Semantic Scholar
This effect increases with population size and with graded degrees of heterogeneity.	Semantic Scholar
We complemented these results with an analysis of coding based on the Chernoff distance, as well as derivations of inequalities on coding in certain limits, from which we can conclude that the beneficial effect of heterogeneity occurs over a broad set of conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Together, our results indicate that the presence of functional diversity in neural populations can enhance their coding fidelity appreciably.	Semantic Scholar
A noteworthy outcome of our study is that this effect can be extremely strong and should be taken into account when investigating design principles for neural circuits.	Semantic Scholar
Brain tumor, be it primary or metastatic, is usually life threatening for a person of any age.	Semantic Scholar
Primary surgical resection is one of the most effective ways of treating brain tumors and can have a tremendously increased success rate if the appropriate imaging modality is used for complete tumor resection.	Semantic Scholar
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging modality of choice for brain tumor imaging because of its excellent soft-tissue contrast.	Semantic Scholar
MRI combined with continuum soft robotics has immense potential to be the next major technological breakthrough in the field of brain cancer diagnosis and therapy.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present the design, kinematic, and force analysis of a flexible spring-based minimally invasive neurosurgical intracranial robot.	Semantic Scholar
It is comprised of an interconnected inner spring and an outer spring and is connected to actively cooled shape memory alloy (SMA) spring actuators via tendon driven mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
Our robot has three serially connected 2-DoF segments, which can be independently controlled due to the central tendon routing configuration.	Semantic Scholar
The kinematic and force analysis of the robot and the independent segment control were verified by experiments.	Semantic Scholar
Robot motion under forced cooling of SMA springs was evaluated as well as the MRI compatibility of the robot and its motion capability in brain-like gelatin environment.	Semantic Scholar
Crowdsourcing has been widely established as a means to enable human computation at large-scale, in particular for tasks that require manual labelling of large sets of data items.	Semantic Scholar
Answers obtained from heterogeneous crowd workers are aggregated to obtain a robust result.	Semantic Scholar
However, existing methods for answer aggregation are designed for  discrete tasks, where answers are given as a single label per item.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we consider  partial-agreement tasks that are common in many applications such as image tagging and document annotation, where items are assigned sets of labels.	Semantic Scholar
Common approaches for the aggregation of partial-agreement answers either (i) reduce the problem to several instances of an aggregation problem for discrete tasks or (ii) consider each label independently.	Semantic Scholar
Going beyond the state-of-the-art, we propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric model to aggregate the partial-agreement answers in a generic way.	Semantic Scholar
This model enables us to compute the consensus of partially-sound and partially-complete worker answers, while taking into account mutual relationships in labels and different answer sets.	Semantic Scholar
We also show how this model is instantiated for incremental learning, incorporating new answers from crowd workers as they arrive.	Semantic Scholar
An evaluation of our method using real-world datasets reveals that it consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of precision, recall, and robustness against faulty workers and data sparsity.	Semantic Scholar
Self-propelled swimming microrobots have significant potential for medical applications.	Semantic Scholar
The outstanding technical challenges are the realization of a propulsion mechanism suitable for micro/nanoscale fluids and of an energy supply mechanism that can function inside the human body.	Semantic Scholar
Our proposed concept uses electroosmotic propulsion (EOP) and biofuel cell (BFC).	Semantic Scholar
The BFC mechanism has a bioanode and a biocathode that generate an open-circuit potential (OCP) by redox reactions of biofuels.	Semantic Scholar
The EOP mechanism has an insulating tube arranged between the electrodes.	Semantic Scholar
Electroosmotic flow is generated inside the tube by the electric force from the OCP.	Semantic Scholar
A reaction force then propels the robot.	Semantic Scholar
We derived a theoretical model of the EOP mechanism, which suggested that a smaller robot would have a greater velocity.	Semantic Scholar
A microscale prototype was designed and fabricated using an insulating SU-8 layer and two conductive SU-8 layers incorporating enzymes, with glucose and oxygen as the biofuels.	Semantic Scholar
“Proof-of-Concept” experiments were conducted using the 100 $\mu$m prototypes.	Semantic Scholar
The observed self-propulsion in the glucose solution was compared with the theoretically estimated values.	Semantic Scholar
The results confirmed the validity of the concept.	Semantic Scholar
This configuration can be used as a standalone biomedical microrobot, or as an actuator element in a robot system.	Semantic Scholar
Networks have become instrumental in deciphering how information is processed and transferred within systems in almost every scientific field today.	Semantic Scholar
Nearly all network analyses, however, have relied on humans to devise structural features of networks believed to be most discriminative for an application.	Semantic Scholar
We present a framework for comparing and classifying networks without human-crafted features using deep learning.	Semantic Scholar
After training, autoencoders contain hidden units that encode a robust structural vocabulary for succinctly describing graphs.	Semantic Scholar
We use this feature vocabulary to tackle several network mining problems and find improved predictive performance versus many popular features used today.	Semantic Scholar
These problems include uncovering growth mechanisms driving the evolution of networks, predicting protein network fragility, and identifying environmental niches for metabolic networks.	Semantic Scholar
Deep learning offers a principled approach for mining complex networks and tackling graph-theoretic problems.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a motion planning method for automatic operation of cloth products.	Semantic Scholar
The problem setting we adopt here is that the current shape state of a cloth product and the shape state of the goal are given.	Semantic Scholar
It is necessary to decide where and what kind of manipulation is to be applied, and it is not always possible to arrive at the goal state by a single operation; that is, multiple operations might be necessary.	Semantic Scholar
To this problem, we propose a novel motion planning method.	Semantic Scholar
Our method directly connects cloth manipulations with shape changes of the cloth, by means of a deep neural network.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness of the proposed method was confirmed by simulation and real robot experiments.	Semantic Scholar
When using tablet computers, smartphones, or digital pens, human users perform movements with a stylus or their fingers that can be analyzed by the kinematic theory of rapid human movements.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a user-centered system for signature verification that performs such a kinematic analysis to verify the identity of the user.	Semantic Scholar
It is one of the first systems that is based on a direct comparison of the elementary neuromuscular strokes which are detected in the handwriting.	Semantic Scholar
Taking into account the number of strokes, their similarity, and their timing, the string edit distance is employed to derive a dissimilarity measure for signature verification.	Semantic Scholar
On several benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that this neuromuscular analysis is complementary to a well-established verification using dynamic time warping.	Semantic Scholar
By combining both approaches, our verifier is able to outperform current state-of-the-art results in on-line signature verification.	Semantic Scholar
To realize robotic systems in real-world settings, e.g., in restaurants, it will be necessary to achieve dynamic manipulation of nontrivial objects.	Semantic Scholar
In this context, this letter discusses methodologies used to realize trajectories in a robotic arm platform, specifically, applied to flipping burgers as an example of nonprehensile object manipulation.	Semantic Scholar
Flipping of burgers involves a series of tasks—going to the burger location, scooping, picking up, and flipping.	Semantic Scholar
Since the goal is to obtain these trajectories in a reasonably fast manner, we employ direct collocation based multisegmented trajectory optimization.	Semantic Scholar
We will first describe the problem setup, and then describe the constraints, decision variables employed, and then, to conclude, we will demonstrate these behaviors in a 6-DOF robot experimentally.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we detect communities from trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
Existing algorithms for trajectory clustering usually rely on simplex representation and a single proximity-related metric.	Semantic Scholar
Unfortunately, additional information markers (e.g., social interactions or semantics in the spatial layout) are ignored, leading to the inability to fully discover the communities in trajectory database.	Semantic Scholar
This is especially true for human-generated trajectories, where additional fine-grained markers (e.g., movement velocity at certain locations, or the sequence of semantic spaces visited) are especially useful in capturing latent relationships among community members.	Semantic Scholar
To overcome this limitation, we propose TODMIS, a general framework for Trajectory-based cOmmunity Detection by diffusion modeling on Multiple Information Sources.	Semantic Scholar
TODMIS combines additional information with raw trajectory data and construct the diffusion process on multiple similarity metrics.	Semantic Scholar
It also learns the consistent graph Laplacians by constructing the multi-modal diffusion process and optimizing the heat kernel coupling on each pair of similarity matrices from multiple information sources.	Semantic Scholar
Then, dense sub-graph detection is used to discover the set of distinct communities (including community size) on the coupled multi-graph representation.	Semantic Scholar
At last, based on the community information, we propose a novel model for online recommendation.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate TODMIS and our online recommendation methods using different real-life datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.	Semantic Scholar
When operating in human environments, such as homes, robots could use tactile sensing to better perceive objects.	Semantic Scholar
A challenge that has not been sufficiently addressed is the influence of an object's surroundings on tactile perception.	Semantic Scholar
Prior research has focused on perception of objects in laboratory settings.	Semantic Scholar
Yet, a number of factors found in homes can affect multimodal tactile sensing.	Semantic Scholar
For example, the time-varying thermal characteristics of an object's surroundings, such as sunlight, HVAC, and refrigeration, can affect thermal sensing.	Semantic Scholar
Likewise, the placement of an object with respect to other objects and surfaces will affect force sensing and alter the way an object moves when pushed.	Semantic Scholar
In order to investigate these and other issues, we had a mobile robot reach out and push 47 different objects found in a real home over a three day period resulting in 1340 pushing episodes.	Semantic Scholar
We then characterized the performance of data-driven methods (k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, hidden Markov models, long short-term memory networks) for a variety of tactile perception problems using the first two seconds of force, thermal, and motion sensing data collected by the robot.	Semantic Scholar
We paid particular attention to the ability of these methods to generalize what they have learned to different robot velocities, times of day, and object instances.	Semantic Scholar
Our results demonstrate the value of multimodal tactile sensing and data-driven methods for tactile perception from short-duration contact, and also illustrate the great diversity of real-world phenomena relevant to tactile sensing.	Semantic Scholar
The spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model has been extensively shown to be fundamental for legged locomotion.	Semantic Scholar
However, the way this low-order template model dynamics is anchored in high-dimensional articulated multibody systems describing compliantly actuated robots (and animals) is not obvious and has not been shown so far.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, an articulated leg mechanism and a corresponding quadrupedal robot design are introduced, for which the natural oscillation dynamics is structurally equivalent to the SLIP.	Semantic Scholar
On the basis of this property, computationally simple and robust control methods are proposed, which implement the gaits of pronking, trotting, and dynamic walking in the real robotic system.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments with a compliantly actuated quadruped featuring only low-performance electrical drives validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	Semantic Scholar
Distributed tactile sensing is crucial to perform stable, subtle, and precise manipulation so that a robot can recognize and handle objects properly.	Semantic Scholar
However, currently existing skin sensors still have common problems such as complex and expensive production or are difficult to integrate into robot hands.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, a practical distributed soft skin sensor system that can cover various parts of the robot hand, measure force in 3-axis, with a subcentimeter spatial density, and digital output at the same time does not exist yet.	Semantic Scholar
This letter discusses uSkin, a soft, distributed, 3-axis force sensor for robot hands and presents its implementation for multicurved fingertips.	Semantic Scholar
The sensor is low-cost, easy to manufacture, and can measure normal and shear forces.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results revealed that this sensor has 10% hysteresis for perpendicular force with a maximum range of 6 N. The Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) value of 54 dB for 0.4 N load was achieved, which constitutes the state of the art for this kind of sensors.	Semantic Scholar
Evaluation experiments also showed that the distributed 3-axis load cells could produce vectors that represent the shape of objects.	Semantic Scholar
This opens the possibility that the sensor can be used for classifying different shapes.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the fingertip sensor was installed on the Allegro hand and the changing force measurements when the robot is grasping an object are presented.	Semantic Scholar
We study the problem of finding related forum posts to a post at hand.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to traditional approaches for finding related documents that perform content comparisons across the content of the posts as a whole, we consider each post as a set of segments, each written with a different goal in mind.	Semantic Scholar
We advocate that the relatedness between two posts should be based on the similarity of their respective segments that are intended for the same goal, i.e., are conveying the same intention.	Semantic Scholar
This means that it is possible for the same terms to weigh differently in the relatedness score depending on the intention of the segment in which they are found.	Semantic Scholar
We have developed a segmentation method that by monitoring a number of text features can identify the parts of a post where significant jumps occur indicating a point where a segmentation should take place.	Semantic Scholar
The generated segments of all the posts are clustered to form intention clusters and then similarities across the posts are calculated through similarities across segments with the same intention.	Semantic Scholar
We experimentally illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our segmentation method and our overall approach of finding related forum posts.	Semantic Scholar
It is well known that dense coding with local bases (via Least Square coding schemes) can lead to large quantization errors or poor performances of machine learning tasks.	Semantic Scholar
On the other hand, sparse coding focuses on accurate representation without taking into account data locality due to its tendency to ignore the intrinsic structure hidden among the data.	Semantic Scholar
Local Hybrid Coding (LHC) (Xiang et al., 2014) was recently proposed as an alternative to the sparse coding scheme that is used in Sparse Representation Classifier (SRC).	Semantic Scholar
The LHC blends sparsity and bases-locality criteria in a unified optimization problem.	Semantic Scholar
It can retain the strengths of both sparsity and locality.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, the hybrid codes would have some advantages over both dense and sparse codes.	Semantic Scholar
This paper introduces a data-driven graph construction method that exploits and extends the LHC scheme.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we propose a new coding scheme coined Adaptive Local Hybrid Coding (ALHC).	Semantic Scholar
The main contributions are as follows.	Semantic Scholar
First, the proposed coding scheme adaptively selects the local and non-local bases of LHC using data similarities provided by Locality-constrained Linear code.	Semantic Scholar
Second, the proposed ALHC exploits local similarities in its solution.	Semantic Scholar
Third, we use the proposed coding scheme for graph construction.	Semantic Scholar
For the task of graph-based label propagation, we demonstrate high classification performance of the proposed graph method on four benchmark face datasets: Extended Yale, PF01, PIE, and FERET.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a method for online trajectory planning in known environments.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed algorithm is a fusion of sampling-based techniques and model-based optimization via quadratic programming.	Semantic Scholar
The former is used to efficiently generate an obstacle-free path while the latter takes into account the robot dynamical constraints to generate a time-dependent trajectory.	Semantic Scholar
The main contribution of this work lies on the formulation of a convex optimization problem over the generated obstacle-free path that is guaranteed to be feasible.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, in contrast with previously proposed methods, iterative formulations are not required.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method has been compared with state-of-the-art approaches showing a significant improvement in success rate and computation time.	Semantic Scholar
To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach for online planning, the proposed method was applied to the fluid autonomous navigation of a quadcopter in multiple environments consisting of up to 200 obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
The scenarios hereinafter presented are some of the most densely cluttered experiments for online planning and navigation reported to date.	Semantic Scholar

For creating robots that are capable of human-like performance in terms of speed, energetic properties, and robustness, intrinsic compliance is a promising design element.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we investigate the principle effects of elastic energy storage and release for basketball dribbling in terms of open-loop cycle stability.	Semantic Scholar
We base the analysis, which is performed for the 1-degree-of-freedom (DoF) case, on error propagation, peak power performance during hand contact, and robustness with respect to varying hand stiffness.	Semantic Scholar
As the ball can only be controlled during contact, an intrinsically elastic hand extends the contact time and improves the energetic characteristics of the process.	Semantic Scholar
To back up our basic insights, we extend the 1-DoF controller to 6-DoFs and show how passive compliance can be exploited for a 6-DoF cyclic ball dribbling task with a 7-DoF articulated Cartesian impedance controlled robot.	Semantic Scholar
As a human is able to dribble blindly, we decided to focus on the case of contact force sensing only, i.e., no visual information is necessary in our approach.	Semantic Scholar
We show via simulation and experiment that it is possible to achieve a stable dynamic cycle based on the 1-DoF analysis for the primary vertical axis together with control strategies for the secondary translations and rotations of the task.	Semantic Scholar
The scheme allows also the continuous tracking of a desired dribbling height and horizontal position.	Semantic Scholar
The approach is also used to hypothesize about human dribbling and is validated with captured data.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a new algorithm for optimal control (OC) of nonlinear dynamical systems.	Semantic Scholar
The main feature of this algorithm is that it allows the specification of the control objectives as a hierarchy of tasks, each task representing an action that the robot should perform.	Semantic Scholar
Each task is described by a cost function that the algorithm tries to minimize, while not affecting the tasks of higher priority.	Semantic Scholar
The concept of strict priority allows for an easier and more robust specification of the control objectives, without hand tuning of task weights.	Semantic Scholar
The hierarchy also makes it possible to properly regularize the behavior of each task independently.	Semantic Scholar
For the first time, we properly define the problem of regularizing the task cost functions in the presence of a hierarchy and propose an algorithm to compute an approximate solution.	Semantic Scholar
Several simulated scenarios with different robots compare our solution with other state-of-the-art methods, validating the interest of the hierarchy in OC and empirically demonstrating the importance of regularization to generate feasible behaviors.	Semantic Scholar

Much work has focused on automatically constructing conceptual taxonomies or semantic networks from large text corpora.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we use a state-of-the-art data-driven conceptual taxonomy, Probase, to show that missing links in taxonomies are the chief problem that hinders their adoption by many real life applications, for the missing links break the inferencing that the conceptual taxonomy claims to support.	Semantic Scholar
To solve this problem, we devise a collaborative filtering framework to infer missing links in taxonomies derived from text corpora.	Semantic Scholar
We implement our method mainly on Probase, creating a denser taxonomy containing 5.1 million (about 30 percent) more isA relationships, with an accuracy of above 90 percent.	Semantic Scholar
We conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the quality of the revised conceptual taxonomies.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents the design of a new exoskeleton for thumb.	Semantic Scholar
The main feature of this device is a high degree of underactuation.	Semantic Scholar
In fact, the five degrees of freedom (dof) of the thumb are actuated by just one linear actuator.	Semantic Scholar
Other features of the thumb-exos are its capability of exert only forces normal to the phalanx axis in the contact point, and its adaptability to different finger sizes.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, the spatial kinematic model is described and the link lengths are determined by means of a genetic algorithm (GA) over four basic grasping poses and the open hand pose.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the thumb-exos mechanism was implemented and integrated in a full hand exoskeleton device.	Semantic Scholar
Performance of the thumb exoskeleton in terms of adaptation to different objects and hand sizes, and in terms of grasping forces have been evaluated through experiments and measuring muscular activity, grasping pressure and forces at different locations of the mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
The role of the phase response curve (PRC) shape on the synchrony of synaptically coupled oscillating neurons is examined.	Semantic Scholar
If the PRC is independent of the phase, because of the synaptic form of the coupling, synchrony is found to be stable for both excitatory and inhibitory coupling at all rates, whereas the antisynchrony becomes stable at low rates.	Semantic Scholar
A faster synaptic rise helps extend the stability of antisynchrony to higher rates.	Semantic Scholar
If the PRC is not constant but has a profile like that of a leaky integrate-and-fire model, then, in contrast to the earlier reports that did not include the voltage effects, mutual excitation could lead to stable synchrony provided the synaptic reversal potential is below the voltage level the neuron would have reached in the absence of the interaction and threshold reset.	Semantic Scholar
This level is controlled by the applied current and the leakage parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Such synchrony is contingent on significant phase response (that would result, for example, by a sharp PRC jump) occurring during the synaptic rising phase.	Semantic Scholar
The rising phase, however, does not contribute significantly if it occurs before the voltage spike reaches its peak.	Semantic Scholar
Then a stable near-synchronous state can still exist between type 1 PRC neurons if the PRC shows a left skewness in its shape.	Semantic Scholar
These results are examined comprehensively using perfect integrate-and-fire, leaky integrate-and-fire, and skewed PRC shapes under the assumption of the weakly coupled oscillator theory applied to synaptically coupled neuron models.	Semantic Scholar
Training a Spiking Neural Network using SpikeProp and its derivatives faces stability issues.	Semantic Scholar
Surges, marked by a sudden rise in learning cost, are a common occurrence during the learning process.	Semantic Scholar
They disrupt the learning process and often destabilize the process resulting in failure.	Semantic Scholar
A proper learning rate, which is neither too small nor too big, is important to minimize surges.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, external disturbances due to imperfection in sample data as well as internal disturbances are additional destabilizing source during the learning process.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we perform error system analysis incorporating external disturbance, followed by weight convergence analysis along with detailed robust stability analysis of SpikeProp learning process to ensure error bound of the learning process.	Semantic Scholar
Based on these results, we propose a robust adaptive learning rate scheme that aligns with the results of theoretical analysis.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of the proposed method has been compared with other prevalent methods based on different benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate that our method indeed has better performance in terms of convergence and learning speed as well.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a wearable haptic device for the forearm and its application in robotic teleoperation.	Semantic Scholar
The device is able to provide skin stretch, pressure, and vibrotactile stimuli.	Semantic Scholar
Two servo motors, housed in a 3D printed lightweight platform, actuate an elastic fabric belt, wrapped around the arm.	Semantic Scholar
When the two servo motors rotate in opposite directions, the belt is tightened (or loosened), thereby compressing (or decompressing) the arm.	Semantic Scholar
On the other hand, when the two motors rotate in the same direction, the belt applies a shear force to the arm skin.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the belt houses four vibrotactile motors, positioned evenly around the arm at 90 $^\circ$ from each other.	Semantic Scholar
The device weights 220 g for  $\text{115}\times \text{122}\times \text{50}$ mm of dimensions, making it wearable and unobtrusive.	Semantic Scholar
We carried out a perceptual characterization of the device as well as two human-subjects teleoperation experiments in a virtual environment, employing a total of 34 subjects.	Semantic Scholar
In the first experiment, participants were asked to control the motion of a robotic manipulator for grasping an object; in the second experiment, participants were asked to teleoperate the motion of a quadrotor fleet along a given path.	Semantic Scholar
In both scenarios, the wearable haptic device provided feedback information about the status of the slave robot(s) and of the given task.	Semantic Scholar
Results showed the effectiveness of the proposed device.	Semantic Scholar
Performance on completion time, length trajectory, and perceived effectiveness when using the wearable device improved of 19.8%, 25.1%, and 149.1% than when wearing no device, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, all subjects but three preferred the conditions including wearable haptics.	Semantic Scholar
The classification of data streams is an interesting but also a challenging problem.	Semantic Scholar
A data stream may grow infinitely making it impractical for storage prior to processing and classification.	Semantic Scholar
Due to its dynamic nature, the underlying distribution of the data stream may change over time resulting in the so-called concept drift or the possible emergence and fading of classes, known as concept evolution.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, acquiring labels of data samples in a stream is admittedly expensive if not infeasible at all.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a novel stream-based active learning algorithm (SAL) which is capable of coping with both concept drift and concept evolution by adapting the classification model to the dynamic changes in the stream.	Semantic Scholar
SAL is the first AL algorithm in the literature to explicitly take account of these concepts.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, using SAL, only labels of samples that are expected to reduce the expected future error are queried.	Semantic Scholar
This process is done while tackling the problem of sampling bias so that samples that induce the change (i.e., drifting samples or samples coming from new classes) are queried.	Semantic Scholar
To efficiently implement SAL, the paper proposes the application of non-parametric Bayesian models allowing to cope with the lack of prior knowledge about the data stream.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, Dirichlet mixture models and the stick breaking process are adopted and adapted to meet the requirements of online learning.	Semantic Scholar
The empirical results obtained on real-world benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SAL in terms of classification performance over the state-of-the-art methods using average and average class accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
High-precision positioning is an essential requirement for sample operation at a small scale.	Semantic Scholar
At the current stage, although nanometer-scale accuracy has been achieved for the linear positioning, the rotational positioning (attitude control) is still very challenging and rarely addressed.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a rotatable nanorobotic system with rotational degrees of freedom first.	Semantic Scholar
Then, the system error, i.e., nonaxisymmetrical eccentricity error of the mechanism, is investigated dynamically and its fault model is established.	Semantic Scholar
After that, a double-loop servo repetitive controller is accordingly designed based on the circle interpolation strategy.	Semantic Scholar
The theoretical analysis and experimental results verify that the rotational positioning accuracy can be controlled up to submicrometers stably, which improves at least one order of magnitude than the current static method.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, two application cases are given to highlight the significance of this approach, i.e., surface defect detection from  $\text{360}^{\circ }$ and in situ twisting characterization of 1-D micro/nanomaterial.	Semantic Scholar
This research paves a new avenue for the ultrahigh rotational positioning at microscopy environment, which is expected to generate a long-term impact on the micro/nanofields, such as microscopy imaging, material characterization, and so on.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper a novel training technique is proposed to offer an efficient solution for neural network training in non-trivial and critical applications such as the diagnosis of health threatening illness.	Semantic Scholar
The presented technique aims to enhance the generalization capability of a neural network while preserving its sensitivity and precision.	Semantic Scholar
The implemented method has been devised in order to slowly increase, during training, the generalization capabilities of a Radial Basis Probabilistic Neural Network classifier, as well as preventing it from over-generalization and the consequent lack of resulting classification performances.	Semantic Scholar
The developed method was tested on Electrocardiograms.	Semantic Scholar
These latter are generally considered non-trivial both due to the difficulty to recognize some anomalous heart activities, and due to the intermittent nature of abnormal beat occurrences.	Semantic Scholar
The implemented training method obtained satisfactory performances, sensitivity and precision while showing high generalization capabilities.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a set of novel tactile descriptors to enable robotic systems to extract robust tactile information during tactile object explorations, regardless of the number of the tactile sensors, sensing technologies, type of exploratory movements, and duration of the objects’ surface exploration.	Semantic Scholar
The performance and robustness of the tactile descriptors are verified by testing on four different sensing technologies (dynamic pressure sensors, accelerometers, capacitive sensors, and impedance electrode arrays) with two robotic platforms (one anthropomorphic hand and one humanoid), and with a large set of objects and materials.	Semantic Scholar
Using our proposed tactile descriptors, the Shadow Hand, which has multimodal robotic skin on its fingertips, successfully classified 120 materials (100% accuracy) and 30 in-hand objects (98% accuracy) with regular and irregular textural structure by executing human-like active exploratory movements on their surface.	Semantic Scholar
The robustness of the proposed descriptors was assessed further during the large object discrimination with a humanoid.	Semantic Scholar
With a large sensing area on its upper body, the humanoid classified 120 large objects with multiple weights and various textures while the objects slid between its sensitive hands, arms, and chest.	Semantic Scholar
The achieved 90% recognition rate shows that the proposed tactile descriptors provided robust tactile information from the large number of tactile signals for identifying large objects via their surface texture regardless of their weight.	Semantic Scholar
Model-based predictive control approaches can be successfully applied to the trajectory tracking of wheeled mobile-robot applications if the process nonlinearity is considered, if real-time performance is achieved and if assumptions made in the control-law design are met when applied to a particular process.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, continuous tracking-error model-based predictive control is presented.	Semantic Scholar
The controller’s optimal actions are obtained from an explicit solution of the optimization criteria, which enables fast real-time applications.	Semantic Scholar
Due to its design in continuous time, its usage is not limited to the uniform sampling restrictions of a host computer, as is usually the case in discrete time design.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, better performance is obtained in applications with non-uniform sampling, which is natural in many situations due to imperfect sensors, mismatched clocks, nondeterministic control delays or because of the unknown time of the pre-processing.	Semantic Scholar
The controller-design parameters are insensitive to the sampling time period, which contributes to simpler applications and grater robustness of the controller.	Semantic Scholar

This letter presents a theoretical study on omnidirectional aerial vehicles with body-frame fixed unidirectional thrusters.	Semantic Scholar
Omniplus multirotor designs are defined as the ones that allow to exert a total wrench in any direction using positive-only lift force and drag moment (i.e., positive rotational speed) for each rotor blade.	Semantic Scholar
Algebraic conditions for a design to be omniplus are derived, a simple necessary condition being the fact that at least seven propellers have to be used.	Semantic Scholar
An energy optimal design strategy is then defined as the one minimizing the maximum norm of the input set needed to span a certain wrench ellipsoid for the adopted input allocation strategy.	Semantic Scholar
Two corresponding major design criteria are then introduced: first, a minimum allocation-matrix condition number aims at an equal sharing of the effort needed to generate wrenches in any direction; second, imposing a balanced design guarantees an equal sharing of the extra effort needed to keep the input in the nonnegative orthant.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a numerical algorithm to solve such optimal design problem and a control algorithm to control any omnidirectional platform.	Semantic Scholar
The work is concluded with informative simulation results in nonideal conditions.	Semantic Scholar

Tasks at or above head level have been known to cause discomfort and musculoskeletal disorders.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a novel wearable active pneumatic exoskeletal support system with a power tool based control interface to make work at head level or above more comfortable.	Semantic Scholar
Subjective task effort (Borg CR10), movement velocities, and muscle activity (surface electromyography) have been evaluated and different passive and active operation modes are being compared.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the exoskeleton is capable of performing a substantial reduction in muscle activity, increasing upper arm elevation velocities, and reducing task effort.	Semantic Scholar
The comparison of an active support mode with a trigger button at the tool grip with a passive support mode showed that users reported less resistance for lowering the arm and increased velocities when they were able to adjust the support with a simple button.	Semantic Scholar
We show that for tasks with a varying weight of loads, an adaptive active exoskeleton is greatly beneficial over a passive one as it eases usability and acceptance.	Semantic Scholar
Estimation of a generating partition is critical for symbolization of measurements from discrete-time dynamical systems, where a sequence of symbols from a (finite-cardinality) alphabet may uniquely specify the underlying time series.	Semantic Scholar
Such symbolization is useful for computing measures (e.g., Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy) to identify or characterize the (possibly unknown) dynamical system.	Semantic Scholar
It is also useful for time series classification and anomaly detection.	Semantic Scholar
The seminal work of Hirata, Judd, and Kilminster (2004) derives a novel objective function, akin to a clustering objective, that measures the discrepancy between a set of reconstruction values and the points from the time series.	Semantic Scholar
They cast estimation of a generating partition via the minimization of their objective function.	Semantic Scholar
Unfortunately, their proposed algorithm is nonconvergent, with no guarantee of finding even locally optimal solutions with respect to their objective.	Semantic Scholar
The difficulty is a heuristic nearest neighbor symbol assignment step.	Semantic Scholar
Alternatively, we develop a novel, locally optimal algorithm for their objective.	Semantic Scholar
We apply iterative nearest-neighbor symbol assignments with guaranteed discrepancy descent, by which joint, locally optimal symbolization of the entire time series is achieved.	Semantic Scholar
While most previous approaches frame generating partition estimation as a state-space partitioning problem, we recognize that minimizing the Hirata et al.	Semantic Scholar
(2004) objective function does not induce an explicit partitioning of the state space, but rather the space consisting of the entire time series (effectively, clustering in a (countably) infinite-dimensional space).	Semantic Scholar
Our approach also amounts to a novel type of sliding block lossy source coding.	Semantic Scholar
Improvement, with respect to several measures, is demonstrated over popular methods for symbolizing chaotic maps.	Semantic Scholar
We also apply our approach to time-series anomaly detection, considering both chaotic maps and failure application in a polycrystalline alloy material.	Semantic Scholar
Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is well known to be an effective tool for dimensionality reduction in problems involving big data.	Semantic Scholar
For this reason, it frequently appears in many areas of scientific and engineering literature.	Semantic Scholar
This letter proposes a novel semisupervised NMF algorithm for overcoming a variety of problems associated with NMF algorithms, including poor use of prior information, negative impact on manifold structure of the sparse constraint, and inaccurate graph construction.	Semantic Scholar
Our proposed algorithm, nonnegative matrix factorization with rank regularization and hard constraint (NMFRC), incorporates label information into data representation as a hard constraint, which makes full use of prior information.	Semantic Scholar
NMFRC also measures pairwise similarity according to geodesic distance rather than Euclidean distance.	Semantic Scholar
This results in more accurate measurement of pairwise relationships, resulting in more effective manifold information.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, NMFRC adopts rank constraint instead of norm constraints for regularization to balance the sparseness and smoothness of data.	Semantic Scholar
In this way, the new data representation is more representative and has better interpretability.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on real data sets suggest that NMFRC outperforms four other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of clustering accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
With the proliferation of spatial-textual data such as location-based services and geo-tagged websites, spatial keyword queries are ubiquitous in real life.	Semantic Scholar
One example of spatial-keyword query is the so-called <italic>collective spatial keyword query</italic> (CoSKQ) which is to find for a given query consisting a query location and several query keywords a set of objects which <italic>covers</italic> the query keywords collectively and has the smallest <italic>cost</italic> wrt the query location.	Semantic Scholar
"In the literature, many different functions were proposed for defining the <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">${cost}$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""chan-ieq1-2800746.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> and correspondingly, many different approaches were developed for the CoSKQ problem."	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study the CoSKQ problem systematically by proposing <italic>a unified cost function</italic> and <italic>a unified approach</italic> for the CoSKQ problem (with the unified cost function).	Semantic Scholar
The unified cost function includes all existing cost functions as special cases and the unified approach solves the CoSKQ problem with the unified cost function in a unified way.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments were conducted on both real and synthetic datasets which verified our proposed approach.	Semantic Scholar
Neural-inspired spike-based computing machines often claim to achieve considerable advantages in terms of energy and time efficiency by using spikes for computation and communication.	Semantic Scholar
However, fundamental questions about spike-based computation remain unanswered.	Semantic Scholar
For instance, how much advantage do spike-based approaches have over conventional methods, and under what circumstances does spike-based computing provide a comparative advantage?	Semantic Scholar
Simply implementing existing algorithms using spikes as the medium of computation and communication is not guaranteed to yield an advantage.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we demonstrate that spike-based communication and computation within algorithms can increase throughput, and they can decrease energy cost in some cases.	Semantic Scholar
We present several spiking algorithms, including sorting a set of numbers in ascending/descending order, as well as finding the maximum or minimum or median of a set of numbers.	Semantic Scholar
We also provide an example application: a spiking median-filtering approach for image processing providing a low-energy, parallel implementation.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithms and analyses presented here demonstrate that spiking algorithms can provide performance advantages and offer efficient computation of fundamental operations useful in more complex algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Diversity has long been used as a design tactic in computer systems to achieve various properties.	Semantic Scholar
Multi-agent systems, in particular, have utilized diversity to achieve aggregate properties such as efficiency of resource allocations, and fairness in these allocations.	Semantic Scholar
However, diversity has usually been introduced manually by the system designer.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a decentralized technique, clonal plasticity, that makes homogeneous agents self-diversify, in an autonomic way.	Semantic Scholar
We show that clonal plasticity is competitive with manual diversification, at achieving efficient resource allocations and fairness.	Semantic Scholar
Modern shape analysis allows the fine comparison of shape changes occurring between different objects.	Semantic Scholar
Very often the classic machineries of generalized Procrustes analysis and principal component analysis are used in order to contrast the shape change occurring among configurations represented by homologous landmarks.	Semantic Scholar
However, if size and shape data are structured in different groups thus constituting different morphological trajectories, a data centering is needed if one wants to compare solely the deformation representing the trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
To do that, inter-individual variation must be filtered out.	Semantic Scholar
This maneuver is rarely applied in studies using simulated or real data.	Semantic Scholar
A geometrical procedure named parallel transport, that can be based on various connection types, is necessary to perform such kind of data centering.	Semantic Scholar
Usually, the Levi Civita connection is used for interpolation of curves in a Riemannian space.	Semantic Scholar
It can also be used to transport a deformation.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate that this procedure does not preserve some important characters of the deformation, even in the affine case.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel procedure called ‘TPS Direct Transport’ which is able to perfectly transport deformation in the affine case and to better approximate non affine deformation in comparison to existing tools.	Semantic Scholar
We recommend to center shape data using the methods described here when the differences in deformation rather than in shape are under study.	Semantic Scholar
In the last decades there has been a tremendous increase in demand for Assistive Technologies (AT) useful to overcome functional limitations of individuals and to improve their quality of life.	Semantic Scholar
As a consequence, different research papers addressing the development of assistive technologies have appeared into the literature pushing the need to organize and categorize them taking into account the application assistive aims.	Semantic Scholar
Several surveys address the categorization problem for works concerning a specific need, hence giving the overview on the state of the art technologies supporting the related function for the individual.	Semantic Scholar
Unfortunately, this “user-need oriented” way of categorization considers each technology as a whole and then a deep and critical explanation of the technical knowledge used to build the operative tasks as well as a discussion on their cross-contextual applicability is completely missing making thus existing surveys unlikely to be technically inspiring for functional improvements and to explore new technological frontiers.	Semantic Scholar
To overcome this critical drawback, in this paper an original “task oriented” way to categorize the state of the art of the AT works has been introduced: it relies on the split of the final assistive goals into tasks that are then used as pointers to the works in literature in which each of them has been used as a component.	Semantic Scholar
In particular this paper concentrates on a set of cross-application Computer Vision tasks that are set as the pivots to establish a categorization of the AT already used to assist some of the user’s needs.	Semantic Scholar
For each task the paper analyzes the Computer Vision algorithms recently involved in the development of AT and, finally, it tries to catch a glimpse of the possible paths in the short and medium term that could allow a real improvement of the assistive outcomes.	Semantic Scholar

SimRank is a widely adopted similarity measure for objects modeled as nodes in a graph, based on the intuition that two objects are similar if they are referenced by similar objects.	Semantic Scholar
The recursive nature of SimRank definition makes it expensive to compute the similarity score even for a single pair of nodes.	Semantic Scholar
This defect limits the applications of SimRank.	Semantic Scholar
To speed up the computation, some existing works replace the original model with an approximate model to seek only rough solution of SimRank scores.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we propose a novel solution for computing all-pair SimRank scores.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we propose to convert SimRank to the problem of solving a linear system in matrix form, and further prove that the system is non-singular, diagonally dominate, and symmetric definite positive (for undirected graphs).	Semantic Scholar
Those features immediately lead to the adoption of Conjugate Gradient (CG) and Bi-Conjugate Gradient (BiCG) techniques for efficiently computing SimRank scores.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, a significant improvement on the convergence rate can be achieved; meanwhile, the sparsity of the adjacency matrix is not damaged all the time.	Semantic Scholar
Inspired by the existing common neighbor sharing strategy, we further reduce the computational complexity of the matrix multiplication and resolve the scalable issues.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results show our proposed algorithms significantly outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a widely used performance measure in machine learning.	Semantic Scholar
Increasingly, however, in several applications, ranging from ranking to biometric screening to medicine, performance is measured not in terms of the full area under the ROC curve but in terms of the partial area under the ROC curve between two false-positive rates.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we develop support vector algorithms for directly optimizing the partial AUC between any two false-positive rates.	Semantic Scholar
Our methods are based on minimizing a suitable proxy or surrogate objective for the partial AUC error.	Semantic Scholar
In the case of the full AUC, one can readily construct and optimize convex surrogates by expressing the performance measure as a summation of pairwise terms.	Semantic Scholar
The partial AUC, on the other hand, does not admit such a simple decomposable structure, making it more challenging to design and optimize (tight) convex surrogates for this measure.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach builds on the structural SVM framework of Joachims (2005) to design convex surrogates for partial AUC and solves the resulting optimization problem using a cutting plane solver.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike the full AUC, where the combinatorial optimization needed in each iteration of the cutting plane solver can be decomposed and solved efficiently, the corresponding problem for the partial AUC is harder to decompose.	Semantic Scholar
One of our main contributions is a polynomial time algorithm for solving the combinatorial optimization problem associated with partial AUC.	Semantic Scholar
We also develop an approach for optimizing a tighter nonconvex hinge loss–based surrogate for the partial AUC using difference-of-convex programming.	Semantic Scholar
Our experiments on a variety of real-world and benchmark tasks confirm the efficacy of the proposed methods.	Semantic Scholar
Elucidating neural dynamics is one of the important subjects in neuroscience.	Semantic Scholar
To elucidate nonlinear dynamics of single neurons, it is important to extract nonlinear membrane currents from many types of membrane current candidates.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we propose a sparse modeling method for estimating a conductance-based neuron model from observed data, by extracting necessary membrane currents from multiple candidates.	Semantic Scholar
We show using simulated data that our proposed sparse modeling approach with different sparsity levels for distinct membrane currents extracts only necessary membrane currents from candidates more accurately, compared with least-squares method and sparse method with uniform sparsity level.	Semantic Scholar
The heterogeneity-gap between different modalities brings a significant challenge to multimedia information retrieval.	Semantic Scholar
Some studies formalize the cross-modal retrieval tasks as a ranking problem and learn a shared multi-modal embedding space to measure the cross-modality similarity.	Semantic Scholar
However, previous methods often establish the shared embedding space based on linear mapping functions which might not be sophisticated enough to reveal more complicated inter-modal correspondences.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, current studies assume that the rankings are of equal importance, and thus all rankings are used simultaneously, or a small number of rankings are selected randomly to train the embedding space at each iteration.	Semantic Scholar
Such strategies, however, always suffer from outliers as well as reduced generalization capability due to their lack of insightful understanding of procedure of human cognition.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we involve the self-paced learning theory with diversity into the cross-modal learning to rank and learn an optimal multi-modal embedding space based on non-linear mapping functions.	Semantic Scholar
This strategy enhances the model’s robustness to outliers and achieves better generalization via training the model gradually from easy rankings by diverse queries to more complex ones.	Semantic Scholar
An efficient alternative algorithm is exploited to solve the proposed challenging problem with fast convergence in practice.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experimental results on several benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements over the stateof-the-arts in this literature.	Semantic Scholar

In this paper, we present a control framework that allows magnetic microrobot teams to accomplish complex micromanipulation tasks captured by global linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas.	Semantic Scholar
To address this problem, we propose an optimal control synthesis method that constructs discrete plans for the robots that satisfy both the assigned tasks as well as proximity constraints between the robots due to the physics of the problem.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed algorithm relies on an existing optimal control synthesis approach combined with a novel sampling-based technique to reduce the state-space of the product automaton that is associated with the LTL specifications.	Semantic Scholar
The synthesized discrete plans are executed by the microrobots independently using local magnetic fields.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation studies show that the proposed algorithm can address large-scale planning problems that cannot be solved using existing optimal control synthesis approaches.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we present experimental results that also illustrate the potential of the method in practice.	Semantic Scholar
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first control framework that allows independent control of teams of magnetic microrobots for temporal micromanipulation tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Training a deep neural network with a large number of parameters often leads to overfitting problem.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, Dropout has been introduced as a simple, yet effective regularization approach to combat overfitting in such models.	Semantic Scholar
Although Dropout has shown remarkable results on many deep neural network cases, its actual effect on CNN has not been thoroughly explored.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, training a Dropout model will significantly increase the training time as it takes longer time to converge than a non-Dropout model with the same architecture.	Semantic Scholar
To deal with these issues, we address Biased Dropout and Crossmap Dropout, two novel approaches of Dropout extension based on the behavior of hidden units in CNN model.	Semantic Scholar
Biased Dropout divides the hidden units in a certain layer into two groups based on their magnitude and applies different Dropout rate to each group appropriately.	Semantic Scholar
Hidden units with higher activation value, which give more contributions to the network final performance, will be retained by a lower Dropout rate, while units with lower activation value will be exposed to a higher Dropout rate to compensate the previous part.	Semantic Scholar
The second approach is Crossmap Dropout, which is an extension of the regular Dropout in convolution layer.	Semantic Scholar
Each feature map in a convolution layer has a strong correlation between each other, particularly in every identical pixel location in each feature map.	Semantic Scholar
Crossmap Dropout tries to maintain this important correlation yet at the same time break the correlation between each adjacent pixel with respect to all feature maps by applying the same Dropout mask to all feature maps, so that all pixels or units in equivalent positions in each feature map will be either dropped or active during training.	Semantic Scholar
Our experiment with various benchmark datasets shows that our approaches provide better generalization than the regular Dropout.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, our Biased Dropout takes faster time to converge during training phase, suggesting that assigning noise appropriately in hidden units can lead to an effective regularization.	Semantic Scholar
During the last decades photogrammetric computer vision systems have been well established in scientific and commercial applications.	Semantic Scholar
Recent developments in image-based 3D reconstruction systems have resulted in an easy way of creating realistic, visually appealing and accurate 3D models.	Semantic Scholar
Affordable high quality digital consumer grade cameras and especially the increasing availability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in conjunction with automated multi-view processing pipelines contributed to these developments.	Semantic Scholar
With multi-copter UAVs it is possible to capture images with six degrees of freedom and thus generate a smooth transition from terrestrial images to nadir aerial images.	Semantic Scholar
High accuracy in the reconstruction and a precise georegistration is desired for photogrammetric applications such as mapping, recurrent topographic surveys or architectural and archaeological 3D documentations.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we present a fully automated processing pipeline for precise, metric and geo-accurate 3D reconstructions of complex geometries using various imaging platforms.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach integrates automatic camera calibration and an online feedback method that allows assessment of the final reconstruction quality in terms of image overlap, ground sampling distance and completeness, and thus provides flexibility to adopt the image acquisition strategy already during image recording.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach allows for georeferencing of UAV imagery based on GPS-measurements as well as tie and control point information, which are integrated directly in the bundle adjustment to refine the georegistration and correct for systematic distortions of the image block.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach is furthermore suited for seamlessly matching and integrating images with different scales, from different view points (aerial and terrestrial as well as inside views), and different cameras into one single reconstruction.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our approach based on five different case studies for applications in mining, archaeology and urban environments and present several accuracy related analyses investigating camera calibration, georegistration, camera network configuration and ground sampling distance.	Semantic Scholar
Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to the impairment of impulse conduction and subsequently to an abnormality of limbs function.	Semantic Scholar
To regain locomotor performance in SCI cases, we establish a robust combinatorial regenerative and rehabilitative approach to enhance axonal regeneration in the Sprague–Dawley rat with complete thoracic SCI.	Semantic Scholar
This system consists of a body weight support system, five-bar linkage for driving the rat's ankles, and treadmill for training motor functions.	Semantic Scholar
This system is tested in a rat which is totally transected at T9 and T10 of the spinal cord.	Semantic Scholar
A nanofiber scaffold is implanted in a gap between T9 and T10 of the spinal cord in a spinalized rat for stimulating axonal regrowth.	Semantic Scholar
The position errors are quantified under five static load conditions (no load, 10, 30, 60, and 100 g) and dynamic load condition.	Semantic Scholar
Average root mean square (RMS) position errors in x - and y- axes of the manipulator are 2.1% and 5.3%, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
According to a preliminary test, this system can provide the constant force to support the body weight and can drive the rat's hindlimbs without inducing anxiety or irritation.	Semantic Scholar
From our experiment, average RMS position errors in x - and y- axes of the manipulator are 10% and 11.7%, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
The contribution of this research is the developmental rehabilitation robotic system for a rat with complete thoracic SCI in quadruped posture which can provide more natural walking posture.	Semantic Scholar
The scope of this letter is a developmental rehabilitation robotic system.	Semantic Scholar
We propose an approach for instructing a robot using natural language to solve complex tasks in a dynamic environment.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we elaborate on a framework that allows a humanoid robot to understand natural language, derive symbolic representations of its sensorimotor experience, generate complex plans according to the current world state, and monitor plan execution.	Semantic Scholar
The presented development supports replacing missing objects and suggesting possible object locations.	Semantic Scholar
It is a realization of the concept of structural bootstrapping developed in the context of the European project Xperience.	Semantic Scholar
The framework is implemented within the robot development environment ArmarX.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate the framework on the humanoid robot ARMAR-III in the context of two experiments: a demonstration of the real execution of a complex task in the kitchen environment on ARMAR-III and an experiment with untrained users in a simulation environment.	Semantic Scholar
This paper considers the detection of players in team sport scenes observed with a still or motion-compensated camera.	Semantic Scholar
Background-subtracted foreground masks provide easy-to-compute primary cues to identify the vertical silhouettes of moving players in the scene.	Semantic Scholar
However, they are shown to be too noisy to achieve reliable detections when only a single viewpoint is available, as often desired for reduced deployment cost.	Semantic Scholar
To circumvent this problem, our paper investigates visual classification to identify the true positives among the candidates detected by the foreground mask.	Semantic Scholar
It proposes an original approach to automatically adapt the classifier to the game at hand, making the classifier scene-specific for improved accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
Since this adaptation implies the use of potentially corrupted labels to train the classifier, a semi-naive Bayesian classifier that combines random sets of binary tests is considered as a robust alternative to boosted classification solutions.	Semantic Scholar
In final, our validations on two publicly released datasets prove that our proposed combination of visual and temporal cues supports accurate and reliable players’ detection in team sport scenes observed from a single viewpoint.	Semantic Scholar

Faceted browsing is widely used in Web shops and product comparison sites.	Semantic Scholar
In these cases, a fixed ordered list of facets is often employed.	Semantic Scholar
This approach suffers from two main issues.	Semantic Scholar
First, one needs to invest a significant amount of time to devise an effective list.	Semantic Scholar
Second, with a fixed list of facets, it can happen that a facet becomes useless if all products that match the query are associated to that particular facet.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we present a framework for dynamic facet ordering in e-commerce.	Semantic Scholar
Based on measures for specificity and dispersion of facet values, the fully automated algorithm ranks those properties and facets on top that lead to a quick drill-down for any possible target product.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to existing solutions, the framework addresses e-commerce specific aspects, such as the possibility of multiple clicks, the grouping of facets by their corresponding properties, and the abundance of numeric facets.	Semantic Scholar
In a large-scale simulation and user study, our approach was, in general, favorably compared to a facet list created by domain experts, a greedy approach as baseline, and a state-of-the-art entropy-based solution.	Semantic Scholar
Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) are NP-hard and therefore the number of studies that consider incomplete algorithms for solving them is growing.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, the Max-sum algorithm has drawn attention in recent years and has been applied to a number of realistic applications.	Semantic Scholar
Unfortunately, in many cases Max-sum does not produce high-quality solutions.	Semantic Scholar
More specifically, Max-sum does not converge and explores solutions of low quality when run on problems whose constraint graph representation contains multiple cycles of different sizes.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we advance the state-of-the-art in incomplete algorithms for DCOPs by: (1) proposing a version of the Max-sum algorithm that operates on an alternating directed acyclic graph (Max-sum_AD), which guarantees convergence in linear time; (2) solving a major weakness of Max-sum and Max-sum_AD that causes inconsistent costs/utilities to be propagated and affect the assignment selection, by introducing value propagation to Max-sum_AD (Max-sum_ADVP); and (3) proposing exploration heuristic methods that evidently improve the algorithms performance further.	Semantic Scholar
We prove that Max-sum_ADVP converges to monotonically improving states after each change of direction, and that it is guaranteed to converge in pseudo-polynomial time to a stable solution that does not change with further changes of direction.	Semantic Scholar
Our empirical study reveals a large improvement in the quality of the solutions produced by Max-sum_ADVP on various benchmarks, compared to the solutions produced by the standard Max-sum algorithm, Bounded Max-sum and Max-sum_AD with no value propagation.	Semantic Scholar
It is found to be the best guaranteed convergence inference algorithm for DCOPs.	Semantic Scholar
The exploration methods we propose for Max-sum_ADVP improve its performance further.	Semantic Scholar
However, anytime results demonstrate that their exploration level is not as efficient as a version of Max-sum, which uses Damping.	Semantic Scholar
Three-dimensional feature descriptors are heavily employed in various 3-D perception applications to find keypoint correspondences between two point clouds.	Semantic Scholar
The availability of mobile devices equipped with depth sensors compels the developed applications to be both memory and computationally efficient.	Semantic Scholar
Toward this, in this letter, we present 3DHoPD, a new low-dimensional 3-D feature descriptor that is extremely fast to compute.	Semantic Scholar
The novelty lies in compactly encoding the “3-D” keypoint position by transforming it to a new 3-D space, where the keypoints arising from similar 3-D surface patches lie close to each other.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we propose histograms of point distributions (HoPD) to capture the neighborhood structure, thus forming 3DHoPD (3D+HoPD).	Semantic Scholar
We propose a tailored feature descriptor matching technique, wherein the “3-D” keypoint position in the new 3-D space is used to remove false positive matches, effectively reducing the search space by 90%, and then, the exact match is found using the “HoPD” descriptor.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental evaluation on multiple publicly available datasets shows that 3DHoPD is robust to noise and offers stable and competitive keypoint matching performance to the existing state-of-the-art 3-D descriptors with similar dimensionality across datasets, while requiring dramatically low-computational time (10 $\times$ faster).

In the last decade, given the availability of corpora in several distinct languages, research on multilingual part-of-speech tagging started to grow.	Semantic Scholar
Amongst the novelties there is mWANN-Tagger (multilingual weightless artificial neural network tagger), a weightless neural part-of-speech tagger capable of being used for mostly-suffix-oriented languages.	Semantic Scholar
The tagger was subjected to corpora in eight languages of quite distinct natures and had a remarkable accuracy with very low sample deviation in every one of them, indicating the robustness of weightless neural systems for part-of-speech tagging tasks.	Semantic Scholar
However, mWANN-Tagger needed to be tuned for every new corpus, since each one required a different parameter configuration.	Semantic Scholar
For mWANN-Tagger to be truly multilingual, it should be usable for any new language with no need of parameter tuning.	Semantic Scholar
This article proposes a study that aims to find a relation between the lexical diversity of a language and the parameter configuration that would produce the best performing mWANN-Tagger instance.	Semantic Scholar
Preliminary analyses suggested that a single parameter configuration may be applied to the eight aforementioned languages.	Semantic Scholar
The mWANN-Tagger instance produced by this configuration was as accurate as the language-dependent ones obtained through tuning.	Semantic Scholar
Afterwards, the weightless neural tagger was further subjected to new corpora in languages that range from very isolating to polysynthetic ones.	Semantic Scholar
The best performing instances of mWANN-Tagger are again the ones produced by the universal parameter configuration.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, mWANN-Tagger can be applied to new corpora with no need of parameter tuning, making it a universal multilingual part-of-speech tagger.	Semantic Scholar
Further experiments with Universal Dependencies treebanks reveal that mWANN-Tagger may be extended and that it has potential to outperform most state-of-the-art part-of-speech taggers if better word representations are provided.	Semantic Scholar
There is a growth of demand for automatically analyzing soccer matches and tactics.	Semantic Scholar
Since players are the focus of attentions in soccer matches, player tracking is a fundamental element in most soccer video analysis.	Semantic Scholar
The aim of player tracking is to extract the trajectories of players, and its input is provided through some preprocessing steps including playfield detection, player detection, player labeling, occlusion handling and player appearance modeling.	Semantic Scholar
Soccer player tracking is a complex and challenging task due to difficulties such as blur, illumination change and heavy occlusions.	Semantic Scholar

Propagation is at the very core of t can provide signi: it can provide significant performance boosts as long as the search space reduction is not outweighed by the cost for running the propagators.	Semantic Scholar
A lot of research effort in the CP community is directed toward improving this trade-off.	Semantic Scholar
While experimental evaluation is here of the greatest importance, there exists no systematic and flexible methodology to measure the exact benefits provided by a given (new) filtering procedure.	Semantic Scholar
This work proposes such a framework by relying on replaying search trees to obtain more realistic assessments.	Semantic Scholar
Reducing propagation overhead is done chiefly by 1) devising more efficient algorithms or by 2) using on-line control policies to limit the propagator activations, i.e., mechanisms to reduce the number of propagator calls.	Semantic Scholar
In both cases, obtaining improvements is a long and demanding process with uncertain outcome.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a method to assess the potential gain of both approaches before actually starting the endeavor, providing the community with a tool to best direct the research efforts.	Semantic Scholar
In order to visualize benefits of actual global constraints and the potential of their improvement, we suggest the use of performance profiles.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach is showcased for well-known global constraints: alldifferent, cumulative, binpacking and unary (with transition times).	Semantic Scholar
Manipulation of micrometer to millimeter-scale objects is central to biotechnological and medical applications involving small-scale robotic devices.	Semantic Scholar
Mobile untethered microgrippers have been developed, which use magnetic fields for motion and activation of grasping.	Semantic Scholar
This letter extends the capabilities of such microgrippers by presenting the first example of reliable and autonomous three-dimensional (3-D) micrograsping and cargo delivery of a microgripper using simple control strategies.	Semantic Scholar
This endeavor will allow microgrippers to reliably grasp and transfer microobjects, such as cells, with minimal user input, which is ideal for cooperative tasks performed by multiple microgrippers in future work.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed controller autonomously manipulates a 3-D magnetic microgripper for pick-and-place tasks in the 3-D space.	Semantic Scholar
By regulating the remotely applied force on the microgripper, the 3-D position and velocity of the microgripper are controlled, and the microgripper grasping, i.e., opening and closing, is determined by the magnetic field strength.	Semantic Scholar
In experiments, the microgripper successfully grasps cargoes with cubic, irregular, triangular, and beam shapes using at most 5, 8 , 20, and 24 attempts, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
The microgripper shown here demonstrates fast grasping due to their complete magnetic actuation method.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, a preliminary cell viability test suggests that the microgripper has no adverse effects on living cells.	Semantic Scholar
This study proves the proposed microgripper and controller to be agile and reliable tools for biomedical tasks.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a 3D-2D framework for face recognition that is more practical than 3D-3D, yet more accurate than 2D-2D.	Semantic Scholar
For 3D-2D face recognition, the gallery data comprises of 3D shape and 2D texture data and the probes are arbitrary 2D images.	Semantic Scholar
A 3D-2D system (UR2D) is presented that is based on a 3D deformable face model that allows registration of 3D and 2D data, face alignment, and normalization of pose and illumination.	Semantic Scholar
During enrollment, subject-specific 3D models are constructed using 3D+2D data.	Semantic Scholar
For recognition, 2D images are represented in a normalized image space using the gallery 3D models and landmark-based 3D-2D projection estimation.	Semantic Scholar
A method for bidirectional relighting is applied for non-linear, local illumination normalization between probe and gallery textures, and a global orientation-based correlation metric is used for pairwise similarity scoring.	Semantic Scholar
The generated, personalized, poseand lightnormalized signatures can be used for one-to-one verification or one-to-many identification.	Semantic Scholar
Results for 3D-2D face recognition on the UHDB11 3D-2D database with 2D images under large illumination and pose variations support our hypothesis that, in challenging datasets, 3D-2D outperforms 2D-2D and decreases the performance gap against 3D-3D face recognition.	Semantic Scholar
Evaluations on FRGC v2.0 3D-2D data with frontal facial images, demonstrate that the method can generalize to databases with different and diverse illumination conditions.	Semantic Scholar

This paper addresses the realization of spatial elastic behavior with a parallel or a serial manipulator.	Semantic Scholar
Necessary and sufficient conditions for a manipulator (either parallel or serial) to realize a specific elastic behavior are presented and interpreted in terms of the manipulator geometry.	Semantic Scholar
These conditions completely decouple the requirements on component elastic properties from the requirements on mechanism kinematics.	Semantic Scholar
New construction-based synthesis procedures for spatial elastic behaviors are developed.	Semantic Scholar
With these synthesis procedures, one can select each elastic component of a parallel (or serial) mechanism based on the geometry of a restricted space of allowable candidates.	Semantic Scholar
With each elastic component selected, the space of allowable candidates is further restricted.	Semantic Scholar
For each stage of the selection process, the geometry of the remaining allowable space is described.	Semantic Scholar
Clustering of customer transaction data is an important procedure to analyze customer behaviors in retail and e-commerce companies.	Semantic Scholar
Note that products from companies are often organized as a product tree, in which the leaf nodes are goods to sell, and the internal nodes (except root node) could be multiple product categories.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this tree, we propose the “personalized product tree”, named purchase tree, to represent a customer’s transaction records.	Semantic Scholar
So the customers’ transaction data set can be compressed into a set of purchase trees.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a partitional clustering algorithm, named PurTreeClust, for fast clustering of purchase trees.	Semantic Scholar
A new distance metric is proposed to effectively compute the distance between two purchase trees.	Semantic Scholar
"To cluster the purchase tree data, we first rank the purchase trees as candidate representative trees with a novel separate density, and then select the top <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""chen-ieq1-2763620.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> customers as the representatives of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""chen-ieq2-2763620.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> customer groups."

Finally, the clustering results are obtained by assigning each customer to the nearest representative.	Semantic Scholar

We hypothesized that drivers would implement decisions (lane changing or braking) faster and more correctly when receiving support at a higher automation stage during transitions from conditionally automated driving to manual driving.	Semantic Scholar
In total, 25 participants with a mean age of 25.7 years (range 19–36 years) drove four trials in a driving simulator, experiencing four HMIs having the following different stages of automation: baseline (information acquisition—low), sphere (information acquisition—high), carpet (information analysis), and arrow (decision selection), presented as visual overlays on the surroundings.	Semantic Scholar
The HMIs provided information during two scenarios, namely a lane change and a braking scenario.	Semantic Scholar
Results showed that the HMIs did not significantly affect the drivers’ initial reaction to the take-over request.	Semantic Scholar
Improvements were found, however, in the decision-making process: When drivers experienced the carpet or arrow interface, an improvement in correct decisions (i.e., to brake or change lane) occurred.	Semantic Scholar
It is concluded that visual HMIs can assist drivers in making a correct braking or lane change maneuver in a take-over scenario.	Semantic Scholar
Future research could be directed toward misuse, disuse, errors of omission, and errors of commission.	Semantic Scholar

The learnt pose stream is concurrently processed with a forward kinematic solve of the IMU data and a temporal model (LSTM) exploits the rich spatial and temporal long range dependencies among the solved joints, the two streams are then fused in a final fully connected layer.	Semantic Scholar

The method is based on the construction of a sequence of weighted graphs containing the semantics of the underlying scene, encoded as primitive temporal and spatial relations between the involved objects.	Semantic Scholar
The objects are modeled as three-dimensional ellipsoids, with the formulation of the minimum volume covering ellipsoid problem as a convex optimization program, which is solved by an efficient algorithm.	Semantic Scholar

Compared to existing methods, the proposed framework constructs a dense three-dimensional (3-D) model via a sparse to dense mapping using learned surface normals.	Semantic Scholar
With single view learned depth estimation as prior for monocular visual odometry, we obtain both accurate positioning and high-quality depth reconstruction.	Semantic Scholar
The depth and normal are predicted by a single network trained in a tightly coupled manner.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the performance of visual tracking and depth prediction in comparison to the state-of-the-art in deep monocular dense SLAM.	Semantic Scholar
According to the thin lens model, the classic depth of field (DOF) is defined as the distance range at which objects in front of a camera are in focus.	Semantic Scholar
However, the thin lens poses important practical limitations for modeling the camera focus due to its dependence on internal parameters, such as the focal length, numerical aperture and effective pixel size.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a new model for describing the focus of conventional digital cameras is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
The focus is modeled as the energy of the point-spread-function of the imaging system and describes the joint effect of defocus, diffraction and digitization.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments conducted on different acquisition devices show that the proposed model conforms accurately to the behavior of real systems and outperforms the most similar alternatives in the state-of-the-art.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, in contrast to the classic DOF model, the proposed approach can be used to predict the changes in the focus of conventional digital cameras when changing focus, zoom, and aperture by means of a simple calibration process.	Semantic Scholar
A challenging problem for autonomous exploration is estimating the utility of future samples.	Semantic Scholar

We propose the adaptive sequential sampling algorithm FMEx to successively select observation locations that maximize the probability of improving the best path.	Semantic Scholar
FMEx evaluates a set of proposed observation locations using a novel fast marching update method and selects a location based on the probabilistic likelihood of improving the current best path.	Semantic Scholar
Simulated results show that FMEx finds lower-cost paths with fewer samples than random, maximum variance and confidence bound sampling.	Semantic Scholar
We also show results for sampling bathymetric data to find the best route for a submarine cable.	Semantic Scholar
In problems where sampling is expensive, FMEx selects observation locations that minimize the true path cost.	Semantic Scholar

The coupling terms can be non-diffusive, nonlinear, asymmetric, and with heterogeneous coupling delays.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this approach, both delay-dependent and delay-independent criteria for global cluster synchronization are derived.	Semantic Scholar
We implement the present approach for a nonlinearly coupled neural network with heterogeneous coupling delays.	Semantic Scholar
Two numerical examples are given to show that neural networks can behave in a variety of new collective ways under the synchronization criteria.	Semantic Scholar
These examples also demonstrate that neural networks remain synchronized in spite of coupling delays between neurons across different communities; however, they may lose synchrony if the coupling delays between the neurons within the same community are too large, such that the synchronization criteria are violated.

Different studies have shown the efficiency of a feed-forward neural network in categorizing basic emotional facial expressions.	Semantic Scholar
However, recent findings in psychology and cognitive neuroscience suggest that visual recognition is not a pure bottom-up process but likely involves top-down recurrent connectivity.	Semantic Scholar
In the present computational study, we compared the performances of a pure bottom-up neural network (a standard multi-layer perceptron, MLP) with a neural network involving recurrent top-down connections (a simple recurrent network, SRN) in the anticipation of emotional expressions.	Semantic Scholar
In two complementary simulations, results revealed that the SRN outperformed the MLP for ambiguous intensities in the temporal sequence, when the emotions were not fully depicted but when sufficient contextual information (related to previous time frames) was provided.	Semantic Scholar
Taken together, these results suggest that, despite the cost of recurrent connections in terms of energy and processing time for biological organisms, they can provide a substantial advantage for the fast recognition of uncertain visual signals.	Semantic Scholar
Final assembly, inspection, and maintenance of aircrafts, automobiles, and industrial equipment often requires a robot to reach confined areas that are difficult to access.	Semantic Scholar
While a robot can move freely in open space, the last one foot to a target site in a manufacturing environment is typically cluttered with complex obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we present a novel solution to the last one foot problem.	Semantic Scholar
Inspired by plant stem growth, a new design concept for an expandable arm, the triple scissor extender robot arm (TSERA), is developed to access a confined area through a narrow channel.	Semantic Scholar
The robot consists of a series of expandable segments each of which is able to extend and tilt.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, the robot can elongate its structure along a narrow, winding space.	Semantic Scholar
The novel design concept is accompanied by a new algorithm for path planning, the sequential expansion algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike traditional algorithms for articulated robot path planning, TSERA's sequential expansion algorithm reduces the otherwise computationally expensive multibody path planning problem to a single rigid body kinematics problem.	Semantic Scholar
Exploiting the serial nature of expandable structure, we can compute arm motion by sequentially solving a simple inverse kinematics problem for each segment.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a two-step framework for creating the three-dimensional (3-D) sound map of an environment with a mobile robot.	Semantic Scholar
The first step is the creation of a map that describes the geometry of the environment.	Semantic Scholar
The second step is the addition of the acoustic information to the geometric map.	Semantic Scholar
The result is a sound map that shows the probability of emitting sound for all the structures in the environment.	Semantic Scholar
To build the sound map, a mobile robot equipped with a microphone array drives through the mapped environment.	Semantic Scholar
During this drive, the acoustic information gathered by the microphone array is accumulated in a probabilistic manner.	Semantic Scholar
First, the likelihood of sound source presence in a set of directions is evaluated from the acoustic power received from these directions.	Semantic Scholar
Then, using an estimate of the robot's pose, an acoustic ray casting procedure transfers this likelihood to the structures in the geometric map.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the probability that these structures emit sound is updated accordingly to the likelihood.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that the sound maps are: accurate as it was possible to localize sound sources in 3-D and practical as different types of environments were mapped.	Semantic Scholar
Although the twin support vector regression (TSVR) method has been widely studied and various variants are successfully developed, the structural risk minimization (SRM) principle and model's sparseness are not given sufficient consideration.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a novel nonparallel support vector regression (NPSVR) is proposed in spirit of nonparallel support vector machine (NPSVM), which outperforms existing twin support vector regression (TSVR) methods in the following terms: (1) For each primal problem, a regularized term is added by rigidly following the SRM principle so that the kernel trick can be applied directly to the dual problems for the nonlinear case without considering an extra kernel-generated surface; (2) An ε-insensitive loss function is adopted to remain inherent sparseness as the standard support vector regression (SVR); (3) The dual problems have the same formulation with that of the standard SVR, so computing inverse matrix is well avoided and a sequential minimization optimization (SMO)-type solver is exclusively designed to accelerate the training for large-scale datasets; (4) The primal problems can approximately degenerate to those of the existing TSVRs if corresponding parameters are appropriately chosen.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical experiments on diverse datasets have verified the effectiveness of our proposed NPSVR in sparseness, generalization ability and scalability.	Semantic Scholar
This letter compares the controlled manipulation of micrometer size particles using thermocapillary convective flows generated by laser points or patterns.	Semantic Scholar
Such flows are generated when a surface tension stress is generated at the fluid/gas interface due to a thermal gradient.	Semantic Scholar
Laser heating allows to generate fast, localized flows that are used to displace a particle towards a desired position.	Semantic Scholar
However, these flows are repulsive and so the system is unstable.	Semantic Scholar
Although using the simple laser spot with a closed-loop control enables to control the particle displacement, the control of the particle movement direction is somehow difficult and the particle position stabilization remains challenging.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, it is proposed to use laser patterns to overcome these limitations.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental tests are performed using a 500-$\mu$m-diameter steel spherical particle that is displaced towards a target position.	Semantic Scholar
The preliminary experimental results show that it is possible to overcome the above mentioned limitations while still obtaining maximal particle velocities ranging from 4 to 9 mm/s during the displacement phase.	Semantic Scholar
The comanipulation paradigm, in which a user and a robot simultaneously hold a tool, allows for gesture guidance.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, virtual fixtures, which are geometrical constraints imposed to the tool by the robot, have received great interest in the domain of surgical applications.	Semantic Scholar
So far, this concept has been implemented in the context of open surgery.	Semantic Scholar
This paper explores the application of virtual fixtures for minimally invasive surgery, in which the tool is inserted in the patient through a fulcrum.	Semantic Scholar
Here, a key issue is to return to the surgeon forces that are virtually applied at the instrument distal tip, while the robot is physically attached to the instrument proximal handle.	Semantic Scholar
To this aim, two approaches are investigated.	Semantic Scholar
A first approach consists of applying a full wrench at the proximal end of the instrument that is equal to the wrench constituted by a pure force applied to the instrument's distal tip.	Semantic Scholar
A second approach consists of applying a pure force to the instrument proximal end, thanks to a lever model about the fulcrum.	Semantic Scholar
The two approaches are compared through experiments, during which naive subjects blindly perform virtual object palpation and robot-guided movements.	Semantic Scholar
During experiments, indicators involving motion and force analysis are computed.	Semantic Scholar
The user capacity to distinguish between several virtual objects is evaluated as well.	Semantic Scholar
Although drastically different, the two approaches provide assistance with a similar level of efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
Point cloud registration is the task of aligning 3D scans of the same environment captured from different poses.	Semantic Scholar
When semantic information is available for the points, it can be used as a prior in the search for correspondences to improve registration.	Semantic Scholar
Semantic-assisted Normal Distributions Transform (SE-NDT) is a new registration algorithm that reduces the complexity of the problem by using the semantic information to partition the point cloud into a set of normal distributions, which are then registered separately.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter we extend the NDT registration pipeline by using PointNet, a deep neural network for segmentation and classification of point clouds, to learn and predict per-point semantic labels.	Semantic Scholar
We also present the Iterative Closest Point  (ICP) equivalent of the algorithm, a special case of Multichannel Generalized ICP.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate the performance of SE-NDT against the state of the art in point cloud registration on the publicly available classification data set Semantic3d.net.	Semantic Scholar
We also test the trained classifier and algorithms on dynamic scenes, using a sequence from the public dataset KITTI.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments demonstrate the improvement of the registration in terms of robustness, precision and speed, across a range of initial registration errors, thanks to the inclusion of semantic information.	Semantic Scholar
The results of an experimental study on handwriting on smartwatches are described in this study.	Semantic Scholar
This study aims to gain knowledge on the current practice and possible future developments on smartwatches.	Semantic Scholar
This includes two experiments: the first experiment aims to compare a state-of-the-art commercial handwriting system to other competing text entry methods based on soft keyboards, whereas the other experiment allows us to gather some useful information regarding users’ performance and preference in an ideal setting (without character recognition), so as to direct the design of future handwriting applications on small devices.	Semantic Scholar
In the first experiment, we obtained an initial entry speed of 7.5 wpm, lower than that of the other compared methods.	Semantic Scholar
The performance obtained in the second experiment, in the range of 15–19 wpm, suggests that by appropriately changing some settings (e.g., improved recognition and feedback, preferred writing style, and spare of space characters), the entry speed can be significantly increased.	Semantic Scholar
The results also showed that users prefer to enter uppercase characters and that, although this style of writing requires a significantly greater number of gestures per character, it does not adversely affect the writing speed.	Semantic Scholar
In recent years, sparse and low-rank models have been widely used to formulate appearance subspace for visual tracking.	Semantic Scholar
However, most existing methods only consider the sparsity or low-rankness of the coefficients, which is not sufficient enough for appearance subspace learning on complex video sequences.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, as both the low-rank and the column sparse measures are tightly related to all the samples in the sequences, it is challenging to incrementally solve optimization problems with both nuclear norm and column sparse norm on sequentially obtained video data.	Semantic Scholar
To address above limitations, this paper develops a novel low-rank subspace learning with adaptive penalization (LSAP) framework for subspace based robust visual tracking.	Semantic Scholar
Different from previous work, which often simply decomposes observations as low-rank features and sparse errors, LSAP simultaneously learns the subspace basis, low-rank coefficients and column sparse errors to formulate appearance subspace.	Semantic Scholar
Within LSAP framework, we introduce a Hadamard production based regularization to incorporate rich generative/discriminative structure constraints to adaptively penalize the coefficients for subspace learning.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown that such adaptive penalization can significantly improve the robustness of LSAP on severely corrupted dataset.	Semantic Scholar
To utilize LSAP for online visual tracking, we also develop an efficient incremental optimization scheme for nuclear norm and column sparse norm minimizations.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on 50 challenging video sequences demonstrate that our tracker outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a novel and generic reactionless visual servo controller for a satellite-based multi-arm space robot.	Semantic Scholar
The controller is designed to complete the task of visually servoing the robot’s end-effectors to a desired pose, while maintaining minimum attitude disturbance on the base-satellite.	Semantic Scholar
Task function approach is utilized to coordinate the servoing process and attitude of the base satellite.	Semantic Scholar
A redundancy formulation is used to define the tasks.	Semantic Scholar
The visual serving task is defined as a primary task, while regulating attitude of the base satellite to zero is defined as a secondary task.	Semantic Scholar
The secondary task is defined through a quadratic optimization problem, in such a way that it does not affect the primary task, and simultaneously minimizes its cost function.	Semantic Scholar
Stability analysis of the proposed control methodology is also discussed.	Semantic Scholar
A set of numerical experiments are carried out on different multi-arm space robotic systems.	Semantic Scholar
Theses systems are a planar dual-arm robot, a spatial dual-arm robot, and a three-arm planar robot.	Semantic Scholar
The results of the simulation experiments show efficacy, generality and applicability of the proposed control methodology.	Semantic Scholar
The recent explosion in neuroscience research has markedly increased our understanding of the neurobiological correlates of many psychiatric illnesses, but this has unfortunately not translated into more effective pharmacologic treatments for these conditions.	Semantic Scholar
At the same time, researchers have increasingly sought out biological markers, or biomarkers, as a way to categorize psychiatric illness, as these are felt to be closer to underlying genetic and neurobiological vulnerabilities.	Semantic Scholar
While biomarker-based drug discovery approaches have tended to employ in vivo (e.g., rodent) or in vitro test systems, relatively little attention has been paid to the potential of computational, or in silico, methodologies.	Semantic Scholar
Here we describe such a methodology, using as an example a biophysically detailed computational model of hippocampus that is made to generate putative schizophrenia biomarkers by the inclusion of a number of neuropathological changes that have been associated with the illness (NMDA system deficit, decreased neural connectivity, hyperdopaminergia).	Semantic Scholar
We use the specific inability to attune to gamma band (40 Hz) auditory stimulus as our illness biomarker.	Semantic Scholar
We expose this system to a large number of virtual medications, defined by systematic variation of model parameters corresponding to five cellular-level effects.	Semantic Scholar
The potential efficacy of virtual medications is determined by a wellness metric (WM) that we have developed.	Semantic Scholar
We identify a number of virtual agents that consist of combinations of mechanisms, which are not simply reversals of the causative lesions.	Semantic Scholar
The manner in which this methodology could be extended to other neuropsychiatric conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease, autism, and fragile X syndrome, is discussed.	Semantic Scholar
We present a contact planner for complex legged locomotion tasks: standing up, climbing stairs using a handrail, crossing rubble, and getting out of a car.	Semantic Scholar
The need for such a planner was shown at the DARPA Robotics Challenge, where such behaviors could not be demonstrated (except for egress).	Semantic Scholar
Current planners suffer from their prohibitive algorithmic complexity because they deploy a tree of robot configurations projected in contact with the environment.	Semantic Scholar
We tackle this issue by introducing a reduction property: the reachability condition.	Semantic Scholar
This condition defines a geometric approximation of the contact manifold, which is of low dimension, presents a Cartesian topology, and can be efficiently sampled and explored.	Semantic Scholar
The hard contact planning problem can then be decomposed into two subproblems: first, we plan a path for the root without considering the whole-body configuration, using a sampling-based algorithm; then, we generate a discrete sequence of whole-body configurations in static equilibrium along this path, using a deterministic contact-selection algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The reduction breaks the algorithm complexity encountered in previous works, resulting in the first interactive implementation of a contact planner (open source).	Semantic Scholar
While no contact planner has yet been proposed with theoretical completeness, we empirically show the interest of our framework: in a few seconds, with high success rates, we generate complex contact plans for various scenarios and two robots: HRP-2 and HyQ.	Semantic Scholar
These plans are validated in dynamic simulations or on the real HRP-2 robot.	Semantic Scholar
Our concern is the modular development of a certified static analyzer in the Coq proof assistant.	Semantic Scholar
We focus on the extension of the Verified Polyhedra Library—a certified abstract domain of convex polyhedra—with a linearization procedure to handle polynomial guards.	Semantic Scholar
Based on ring rewriting strategies and interval arithmetic, this procedure partitions the variable space to infer precise affine terms which over-approximate polynomials.	Semantic Scholar
In order to help formal development, we propose a proof framework, embedded in Coq, that implements a refinement calculus.	Semantic Scholar
It is dedicated to the certification of parts of the analyzer—like our linearization procedure—whose correctness does not depend on the implementation of the underlying certified abstract domain.	Semantic Scholar
Like standard refinement calculi, it introduces data-refinement diagrams.	Semantic Scholar
These diagrams relate “abstract states” computed by the analyzer to “concrete states” of the input program.	Semantic Scholar
However, our notions of “specification” and “implementation” are exchanged w.r.t.	Semantic Scholar
standard uses: the “specification” (computing on “concrete states”) refines the “implementation” (computing on “abstract states”).	Semantic Scholar
Our stepwise refinements of specifications hide several low-level aspects of the computations on abstract domains.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, they ignore that the latter may use hints from external untrusted imperative oracles (e.g.	Semantic Scholar
a linear programming solver).	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, refinement proofs are naturally simplified thanks to computations of weakest preconditions.	Semantic Scholar
Using our refinement calculus, we elegantly define our partitioning procedure with a continuation-passing style, thus avoiding an explicit datatype of partitions.	Semantic Scholar
This illustrates that our framework is convenient to prove the correctness of such higher-order imperative computations on abstract domains.	Semantic Scholar
Distant supervision, a widely applied approach in the field of relation extraction can automatically generate large amounts of labeled training corpus with minimal manual effort.	Semantic Scholar
However, the labeled training corpus may have many false-positive data, which would hurt the performance of relation extraction.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, in traditional feature-based distant supervised approaches, extraction models adopt human design features with natural language processing.	Semantic Scholar
It may also cause poor performance.	Semantic Scholar
To address these two shortcomings, we propose a customized attention-based long short-term memory network.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach adopts word-level attention to achieve better data representation for relation extraction without manually designed features to perform distant supervision instead of fully supervised relation extraction, and it utilizes instance-level attention to tackle the problem of false-positive data.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective and achieves better performance than traditional methods.	Semantic Scholar
It is difficult to design agile soft-bodied robots owing to their inherent softness.	Semantic Scholar
To overcome this problem, we propose a structure-integrated bistable module that uses snap-through buckling for agile motions.	Semantic Scholar
First, we confirmed that a 0.05-m-long module was able to jump to 0.13 m high.	Semantic Scholar
Through investigation, we found a range of command parameters within which the module jumps consistently.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we showed that jumping performance had strong relation to the bending amplitude.	Semantic Scholar
Next, we induced a robot with two serially connected modules to roll forward and jump over an obstacle.	Semantic Scholar
In rolling, the robot became round for quick locomotion.	Semantic Scholar
In jumping, we found that buckling in one module induced buckling in the other module.	Semantic Scholar
The difference in buckling time between the two modules was shortened from the order of 0.1 s to the order of 0.01 s. This might be effective for error correction or useful for coordinated motions.	Semantic Scholar
These results show the effectiveness of the proposed structure-integrated bistable modules for making agile soft-bodied robots, and suggest ways of exploiting them.	Semantic Scholar

In conventional core decompression of osteonecrosis, surgeons cannot successfully reach the whole area of the femoral head due to rigidity of the instruments currently used.	Semantic Scholar
To address this issue, we present design and fabrication of a novel steerable drill using a continuum dexterous manipulator (CDM) and two different flexible cutting tools passing through the lumen of the CDM.	Semantic Scholar
A set of experiments investigated functionality and efficiency of the curved-drilling approach and the flexible tools on simulated cancellous bone.	Semantic Scholar
Geometry of the cutter head, rotational and feed velocity of the tool, and pulling tension of the CDM cables have been identified as the effective curved-drilling parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Considering these parameters, we investigated drilling trajectory, contact force, and mass removal for various combinations of feed-velocities (0.05, 0.10, and 0.15 mm/s) and cable tensions (6, 10, 15, and 25 N) with constant rotational speed of 2250 r/min.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that: first, pulling tension of the cable is the most dominant parameter affecting the curved-drilling trajectory; and second, the proposed steerable drill is able to achieve 40° bend without buckling.	Semantic Scholar
Based on these results we developed a method for planning drill trajectories and successfully verified abilities for S-shape and multiple-branch drilling.	Semantic Scholar
The verification experiments were performed on both simulated and human cadaveric bones.	Semantic Scholar
The pose of a rigid object is usually regarded as a rigid transformation, described by a translation and a rotation.	Semantic Scholar
However, equating the pose space with the space of rigid transformations is in general abusive, as it does not account for objects with proper symmetries—which are common among man-made objects.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we define pose as a distinguishable static state of an object, and equate a pose to a set of rigid transformations.	Semantic Scholar
Based solely on geometric considerations, we propose a frame-invariant metric on the space of possible poses, valid for any physical rigid object, and requiring no arbitrary tuning.	Semantic Scholar
This distance can be evaluated efficiently using a representation of poses within a Euclidean space of at most 12 dimensions depending on the object’s symmetries.	Semantic Scholar
This makes it possible to efficiently perform neighborhood queries such as radius searches or k-nearest neighbor searches within a large set of poses using off-the-shelf methods.	Semantic Scholar
Pose averaging considering this metric can similarly be performed easily, using a projection function from the Euclidean space onto the pose space.	Semantic Scholar
The practical value of those theoretical developments is illustrated with an application of pose estimation of instances of a 3D rigid object given an input depth map, via a Mean Shift procedure.	Semantic Scholar
Space robots have attracted increasing attention for performing, autonomously or telerobotically, on-orbit servicing missions such as repairing, refueling, and upgrading spacecraft; reusing space assets; and on-orbit assembly.	Semantic Scholar
The extension of robot application to space can release astronauts from risky, time-consuming, and expensive extravehicular activities [1].	Semantic Scholar
However, in the microgravity environment, the floating base of a space robot will be disturbed by the robot's arm motion when it approaches or manipulates a target.	Semantic Scholar
The motion of the spacecraft base resulting from this disturbance will, conversely, affect the motion of end effectors (known as coupling dynamics), making control of space robots more complicated than that of fixed-base robots.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, such a disturbance of spacecraft attitude may result in a communication interruption between the spacecraft and the ground station or a failure of energy accumulation caused by disorientation of solar panels [2].	Semantic Scholar
Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow users to control a device by interpreting their brain activity.	Semantic Scholar
For simplicity, these devices are designed to be operated by purposefully modulating specific predetermined neurophysiological signals, such as the sensorimotor rhythm.	Semantic Scholar
However, the ability to modulate a given neurophysiological signal is highly variable across individuals, contributing to the inconsistent performance of BCIs for different users.	Semantic Scholar
These differences suggest that individuals who experience poor BCI performance with one class of brain signals might have good results with another.	Semantic Scholar
In order to take advantage of individual abilities as they relate to BCI control, we need to move beyond the current approaches.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we explore a new BCI design aimed at a more individualized and user-focused experience, which we call open-ended BCI.	Semantic Scholar
Individual users were given the freedom to discover their own mental strategies as opposed to being trained to modulate a given brain signal.	Semantic Scholar
They then underwent multiple coadaptive training sessions with the BCI.	Semantic Scholar
Our first open-ended BCI performed similarly to comparable BCIs while accommodating a wider variety of mental strategies without a priori knowledge of the specific brain signals any individual might use.	Semantic Scholar
Post hoc analysis revealed individual differences in terms of which sensory modality yielded optimal performance.	Semantic Scholar
We found a large and significant effect of individual differences in background training and expertise, such as in musical training, on BCI performance.	Semantic Scholar
Future research should be focused on finding more generalized solutions to user training and brain state decoding methods to fully utilize the abilities of different individuals in an open-ended BCI.	Semantic Scholar
Accounting for each individual's areas of expertise could have important implications on BCI training and BCI application design.	Semantic Scholar
Blind source separation (BSS) algorithms extract neural signals from electroencephalography (EEG) data.	Semantic Scholar
However, it is difficult to quantify source separation performance because there is no criterion to dissociate neural signals and noise in EEG signals.	Semantic Scholar
This study develops a method for evaluating BSS performance.	Semantic Scholar
The idea is neural signals in EEG can be estimated by comparison with simultaneously measured electrocorticography (ECoG).	Semantic Scholar
Because the ECoG electrodes cover the majority of the lateral cortical surface and should capture most of the original neural sources in the EEG signals.	Semantic Scholar
We measured real EEG and ECoG data and developed an algorithm for evaluating BSS performance.	Semantic Scholar
First, EEG signals are separated into EEG components using the BSS algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Second, the EEG components are ranked using the correlation coefficients of the ECoG regression and the components are grouped into subsets based on their ranks.	Semantic Scholar
Third, canonical correlation analysis estimates how much information is shared between the subsets of the EEG components and the ECoG signals.	Semantic Scholar
We used our algorithm to compare the performance of BSS algorithms (PCA, AMUSE, SOBI, JADE, fastICA) via the EEG and ECoG data of anesthetized nonhuman primates.	Semantic Scholar
The results (Best case >JADE = fastICA >AMUSE = SOBI ≥ PCA >random separation) were common to the two subjects.	Semantic Scholar
To encourage the further development of better BSS algorithms, our EEG and ECoG data are available on our Web site (http://neurotycho.org/) as a common testing platform.	Semantic Scholar
Motions carry information about the underlying task being executed.	Semantic Scholar
Previous studies on human motion analysis suggest that complex motions may result from the composition of fundamental submovements called movemes.	Semantic Scholar
The existence of finite structure in motion motivates information-theoretic approaches to motion analysis and robotic assistance.	Semantic Scholar
We define task embodiment as the amount of task information encoded in an agent's motions.	Semantic Scholar
By decoding task-specific information embedded in motion, we can use task embodiment to create detailed performance assessments.	Semantic Scholar
We extract an alphabet of behaviors comprising a motion without a priori knowledge using a novel algorithm, which we call dynamical system segmentation.	Semantic Scholar
For a given task, we specify an optimal agent, and compute an alphabet of behaviors representative of the task.	Semantic Scholar
We identify these behaviors in data from agent executions, and compare their relative frequencies against that of the optimal agent using the Kullback–Leibler divergence.	Semantic Scholar
We validate this approach using a dataset of human subjects ($\mathbf {n=53}$) performing a dynamic task, and under this measure find that individuals receiving assistance better embody the task.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we find that task embodiment is a better predictor of assistance than integrated mean-squared error.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a simple yet efficient algorithm to calibrate the joint axis orientation and encoder nonlinearity of cost-effective multiaxis inertially stabilized gimbal systems that are used in unmanned aerial vehicles for imaging stabilization.	Semantic Scholar
The calibration algorithm is based on product-of-exponential formula and able to calibrate axes orientation and encoder nonlinearities simultaneously and autonomously.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the algorithm yields a closed form optimal solution, so that any iteration on exponential map differentiation, normalization, and least square optimization in a conventional iterative least square algorithm can be eliminated.	Semantic Scholar
The closed-form solution is computationally cheap and suitable for embedded implementation.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively calibrate the axis orientation and encoder nonlinearity and significantly improve the gimbal accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
Zero-shot learning for visual recognition, e.g., object and action recognition, has recently attracted a lot of attention.	Semantic Scholar
However, it still remains challenging in bridging the semantic gap between visual features and their underlying semantics and transferring knowledge to semantic categories unseen during learning.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike most of the existing zero-shot visual recognition methods, we propose a stagewise bidirectional latent embedding framework of two subsequent learning stages for zero-shot visual recognition.	Semantic Scholar
In the bottom–up stage, a latent embedding space is first created by exploring the topological and labeling information underlying training data of known classes via a proper supervised subspace learning algorithm and the latent embedding of training data are used to form landmarks that guide embedding semantics underlying unseen classes into this learned latent space.	Semantic Scholar
In the top–down stage, semantic representations of unseen-class labels in a given label vocabulary are then embedded to the same latent space to preserve the semantic relatedness between all different classes via our proposed semi-supervised Sammon mapping with the guidance of landmarks.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, the resultant latent embedding space allows for predicting the label of a test instance with a simple nearest-neighbor rule.	Semantic Scholar
To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we have conducted extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets in object and action recognition, i.e., AwA, CUB-200-2011, UCF101 and HMDB51.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results under comparative studies demonstrate that our proposed approach yields the state-of-the-art performance under inductive and transductive settings.	Semantic Scholar
In order to interact intelligently with objects in the world, animals must first transform neural population responses into estimates of the dynamic, unknown stimuli that caused them.	Semantic Scholar
The Bayesian solution to this problem is known as a Bayes filter, which applies Bayes' rule to combine population responses with the predictions of an internal model.	Semantic Scholar
The internal model of the Bayes filter is based on the true stimulus dynamics, and in this note, we present a method for training a theoretical neural circuit to approximately implement a Bayes filter when the stimulus dynamics are unknown.	Semantic Scholar
To do this we use the inferential properties of linear probabilistic population codes to compute Bayes' rule and train a neural network to compute approximate predictions by the method of maximum likelihood.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we perform stochastic gradient descent on the negative log-likelihood of the neural network parameters with a novel approximation of the gradient.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate our methods on a finite-state, a linear, and a nonlinear filtering problem and show how the hidden layer of the neural network develops tuning curves consistent with findings in experimental neuroscience.	Semantic Scholar
"This letter proposes an <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$N$</tex-math></inline-formula>-link snake robot with parallel elastic actuators (PEA) and a stiffness property that reduces the energy consumption during fast movement."	Semantic Scholar
Each PEA couples the actuator output to a spring element, enhancing the periodic gait as demonstrated in previous studies of walking robots.	Semantic Scholar
The PEA can mimic each joint of a typical snake robot, which is also controlled by sinusoidal periodic signals.	Semantic Scholar
If the actuator output is synchronized with the resonance frequency of the spring, the PEA can greatly reduce the actuator torque and power.	Semantic Scholar
"Therefore, this letter proposes PEAs to reduce the energy consumption of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$N$</tex-math></inline-formula>-link snake robots."	Semantic Scholar
After analyzing the robot dynamics, we explain how the torque of each joint is minimized.	Semantic Scholar
The energy consumption is evaluated by measuring the motor current in experimental tests.	Semantic Scholar
During fast movement of the robot, the PEA reduced the current consumption by 72%.	Semantic Scholar
Group-view displays (GVDs) have become prominent features in modern nuclear control rooms (NCR).	Semantic Scholar
Despite widespread implementation, their efficacy has yet to be thoroughly evaluated.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a full-scale nuclear simulator study that compared the current state of the art in NCR GVDs against experimental alternatives.	Semantic Scholar
The results indicate that the current state of the art in NCR GVDs can be improved upon.	Semantic Scholar
An experimental display configuration (redundant displays) yielded higher communication scores than the standard NCR GVD configuration (large-screen displays).	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, operators using experimental display types (ecological displays) exhibited superior situation awareness compared to those using contemporary NCR displays (advanced displays).	Semantic Scholar
The implications, limitations, and recommendations for future work are discussed.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents an approach for saliency detection able to emulate the integration of the top-down (task-controlled) and bottom-up (sensory information) processes involved in human visual attention.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we first learn how to generate saliency when a specific visual task has to be accomplished.	Semantic Scholar
Afterwards, we investigate if and to what extent the learned saliency maps can support visual classification in nontrivial cases.	Semantic Scholar
To achieve this, we propose SalClassNet, a CNN framework consisting of two networks jointly trained: a) the first one computing top-down saliency maps from input images, and b) the second one exploiting the computed saliency maps for visual classification.	Semantic Scholar
To test our approach, we collected a dataset of eye-gaze maps, using a Tobii T60 eye tracker, by asking several subjects to look at images from the Stanford Dogs dataset, with the objective of distinguishing dog breeds.	Semantic Scholar
Performance analysis on our dataset and other saliency benchmarking datasets, such as POET, showed that SalClassNet outperforms state-of-the-art saliency detectors, such as SalNet and SALICON.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we also analyzed the performance of SalClassNet in a fine-grained recognition task and found out that it yields enhanced classification accuracy compared to Inception and VGG-19 classifiers.	Semantic Scholar
The achieved results, thus, demonstrate that 1) conditioning saliency detectors with object classes reaches state-of-the-art performance, and 2) explicitly providing top-down saliency maps to visual classifiers enhances accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
Union-Find is a famous example of a simple data structure whose amortized asymptotic time complexity analysis is nontrivial.	Semantic Scholar
We present a Coq formalization of this analysis, following Alstrup et al.’s recent proof.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we implement Union-Find as an OCaml library and formally endow it with a modular specification that offers a full functional correctness guarantee as well as an amortized complexity bound.	Semantic Scholar
In order to reason in Coq about imperative OCaml code, we use the CFML tool, which implements Separation Logic for a subset of OCaml, and which we extend with time credits.	Semantic Scholar
Although it was known in principle that amortized analysis can be explained in terms of time credits and that time credits can be viewed as resources in Separation Logic, we believe our work is the first practical demonstration of this approach.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, in order to explain the meta-theoretical foundations of our approach, we define a Separation Logic with time credits for an untyped call-by-value $$\lambda $$ λ -calculus, and formally verify its soundness.	Semantic Scholar
Clique-based neural associative memories introduced by Gripon and Berrou (GB), have been shown to have good performance, and in our previous work we improved the learning capacity and retrieval rate by local coding and precoding in the presence of partial erasures.	Semantic Scholar
We now take a step forward and consider nested-clique graph structures for the network.	Semantic Scholar
The GB model stores patterns as small cliques, and we here replace these by nested cliques.	Semantic Scholar

In this letter, we present a human-in-the-loop learning framework for mobile robots to generate effective local policies in order to recover from navigation failures in long-term autonomy.	Semantic Scholar
We present an analysis of failure and recovery cases derived from long-term autonomous operation of a mobile robot, and propose a two-layer learning framework that allows to detect and recover from such navigation failures.	Semantic Scholar
Employing a learning by demonstration approach, our framework can incrementally learn to autonomously recover from situations it initially needs humans to help with.	Semantic Scholar
The learning framework allows for both real-time failure detection and regression using Gaussian processes.	Semantic Scholar
Our empirical results on two different failure scenarios indicate that given 40 failure state observations, the true positive rate of the failure detection model exceeds 90%, ending with successful recovery actions in more than 90% of all detected cases.	Semantic Scholar
Despite a near-infinite number of possible movement trajectories, our body movements exhibit certain invariant features across individuals; for example, when grasping a cup, individuals choose an approximately linear path from the hand to the cup.	Semantic Scholar
Based on these experimental findings, many researchers have proposed optimization frameworks to determine desired movement trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
Successful conventional frameworks include the geodesic path, which considers the geometry of our complicated body dynamics, and stochastic frameworks, which consider movement variability.	Semantic Scholar
The former succeed in explaining the kinematics in human reaching movements, and the latter succeed in explaining the variability in those movements.	Semantic Scholar
However, the conventional geodesic path framework does not consider variability, and the conventional stochastic frameworks do not consider the geometrical properties of our bodies.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, how to reconcile these two successful frameworks remains unclear.	Semantic Scholar
Here, I show that the conventional geodesic path can be interpreted as a Bayesian framework in which no uncertainty is considered.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, by introducing uncertainty into the framework, I propose a Bayesian geodesic path framework that can simultaneously consider the geometric properties of our bodies and movement variability.	Semantic Scholar
I demonstrate that the Bayesian geodesic path generates a mean movement trajectory that corresponds to the conventional geodesic path and a variability of movement trajectory, thus explaining the characteristic variability in human reaching movements.	Semantic Scholar
This work presents a navigational approach that takes into consideration the perception of comfort by a human passenger.	Semantic Scholar
Comfort is the state of being at ease and free from stress; thus, comfortable navigation is a ride that, in addition to being safe, is perceived by the passenger as being free from anxiety and stress.	Semantic Scholar
This study considers how to compute passenger comfortable paths.	Semantic Scholar
To compute such paths, passenger discomfort is studied in locations with good visibility and those with no visibility.	Semantic Scholar
In locations with good visibility, passenger preference to ride in the road is studied.	Semantic Scholar
For locations with non-visible areas, the relationship between passenger visibility and discomfort is studied.	Semantic Scholar
Autonomous-navigation experiments are performed to build a map of human discomfort that is used to compute global paths.	Semantic Scholar
A path planner is proposed that minimizes a three-variable cost function: location discomfort cost, area visibility cost, and path length cost.	Semantic Scholar
Planner parameters are calibrated towards a composite trajectory histogram built with data taken from participant self-driving trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, autonomous navigation experiments with 30 participants show that the proposed approach is rated as more comfortable than the state-of-the-art shortest planner approach.	Semantic Scholar
Postural hand synergies or eigenpostures are joint angle covariation patterns observed in common grasping tasks.	Semantic Scholar
A typical definition associates the geometry of synergy vectors and their hierarchy (relative statistical weight) with the principal component analysis of an experimental covariance matrix.	Semantic Scholar
In a reduced complexity representation, the accuracy of hand posture reconstruction is incrementally improved as the number of synergies is increased according to the hierarchy.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we explore whether and how hierarchy and incrementality extend from posture description to grasp force distribution.	Semantic Scholar
To do so, we study the problem of optimizing grasps w.r.t.	Semantic Scholar
hand/object relative pose and force application, using hand models with an increasing number of synergies, ordered according to a widely used postural basis.	Semantic Scholar
The optimization is performed numerically, on a data set of simulated grasps of four objects with a 19-DoF anthropomorphic hand.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that the hand/object relative poses that minimize (possibly locally) the grasp optimality index remain roughly the same as more synergies are considered.	Semantic Scholar
This suggests that an incremental learning algorithm could be conceived, leveraging on the solution of lower dimensionality problems to progressively address more complex cases as more synergies are added.	Semantic Scholar
Second, we investigate whether the adopted hierarchy of postural synergies is indeed the best also for force distribution.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that this is not the case.	Semantic Scholar
This paper describes how to achieve highly accurate unsupervised spatial lexical acquisition from speechrecognition results including phoneme recognition errors.	Semantic Scholar
In most research into lexical acquisition, the robot has no pre-existing lexical knowledge.	Semantic Scholar
The robot acquires sequences of some phonemes as words from continuous speech signals.	Semantic Scholar
In a previous study, we proposed a nonparametric Bayesian spatial concept acquisition method (SpCoA) that integrates the robot’s position and words obtained by unsupervised word segmentation from uncertain syllable recognition results.	Semantic Scholar
However, SpCoA has a very critical problem to be solved in lexical acquisition; the boundaries of word segmentation are incorrect in many cases because of many phoneme recognition errors.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we propose an unsupervised machine learning method (SpCoA++) for the robust lexical acquisition of novel words relating to places visited by the robot.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed SpCoA++ method performs an iterative estimation of learning spatial concepts and updating a language model using place information.	Semantic Scholar
SpCoA++ can select a candidate including many words that better represent places from multiple word-segmentation results by maximizing the mutual information between segmented words and spatial concepts.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement of the phoneme accuracy rate of learned words relating to place in the proposed method by word-segmentation results based on place information, in comparison to the conventional methods.	Semantic Scholar
We indicate that the proposed method enables the robot to acquire words from speech signals more accurately, and improves the estimation accuracy of the spatial concepts.	Semantic Scholar

Soft robotic grippers can grasp objects of many different shapes while tolerating misalignments.	Semantic Scholar
However, many current soft systems lack proprioception and the ability to sense the position and orientation of the object to be grasped.	Semantic Scholar
Understanding the configuration of a gripper's fingers and the contact forces on a grasped object is crucial for manipulating an object and for interacting with the external environment.	Semantic Scholar

Using sensors affixed to removable sleeves fit over each gripper finger, we identify the finger position and contact force on a grasped object.	Semantic Scholar
We show that we are able to completely deflate and pack the gripper, and then deploy the gripper and sensors to full operation.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we demonstrate closed-loop control of the gripper configuration using the strain sensors to reconstruct pose.	Semantic Scholar

The ability to detect anomalies in perceived stimuli is critical to a broad range of practical and applied activities involving human operators.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a real-time physiological-based system to assess the cross-task mental workload during anomaly detection.	Semantic Scholar
Forty participants were recruited to detect anomalous images from a set of different distracting images (Task I) and abnormal activities from surveillance videos (Task II).	Semantic Scholar
In Task I, the task difficulty levels were manipulated by changing the number of anomalies/distracting stimuli (15, 21, 28, or 36) with and without time constraints (i.e., 4 × 2 = 8 task difficulty levels).	Semantic Scholar
Physiological and behavioral data from four task difficulty levels were divided into four categories according to subjective ratings of the mental workload.	Semantic Scholar
The support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were trained on these data to predict the mental workload categories of: 1) the same four task difficulty levels (within level); and 2) the other four task difficulty levels in Task I (cross level).	Semantic Scholar
Within-level classifications (with an average of 95.29%) were more accurate than cross-level classifications (average of 72.2%), which were much more accurate than random level classifications (25%).	Semantic Scholar
In Task II, the same participants monitored one, two, or four video clips simultaneously in accordance with three task difficulty levels.	Semantic Scholar
The same physiological signals were processed for real-time recognition of a participant's mental workload after he or she completed each activity detection task.	Semantic Scholar
The three-class SVM classifiers were trained on physiological data from Task I to predict the mental workload categories of the Task II (cross task), achieving an overall classification accuracy of 53.83%, compared to a 33.33% accuracy at random.	Semantic Scholar
These results are discussed in terms of their implications for developing situation-aware recognition systems of the mental workload and adaptive human–computer interaction platforms.	Semantic Scholar
Currently, powerful deep learning models usually require significant resources in the form of processors and memory, which leads to very high energy consumption.	Semantic Scholar
The emerging resistive random access memory (RRAM) has shown great potential for constructing a scalable and energy-efficient neural network.	Semantic Scholar
However, it is hard to port a high-precision neural network from conventional digital CMOS hardware systems to analog RRAM systems owing to the variability of RRAM devices.	Semantic Scholar
A suitable on-chip learning algorithm should be developed to retrain or improve the performance of the neural network.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, determining how to integrate the periphery digital computations and analog RRAM crossbar is still a challenge.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we propose an on-chip learning algorithm, named sign backpropagation (SBP), for RRAM-based multilayer perceptron (MLP) with binary interfaces (0, 1) in forward process and 2-bit (±1, 0) in backward process.	Semantic Scholar
The simulation results show that the proposed method and architecture can achieve a comparable classification accuracy with MLP on MNIST dataset, meanwhile it can save area and energy cost by the calculation and storing of the intermediate results and take advantages of the RRAM crossbar potential in neuromorphic computing.

Orientation control is an important topic with many applications including robotic manipulation, spacecraft control, etc.	Semantic Scholar
The orientation control is particularly challenging when the system model is unknown due to the fact that the rotation group is a nonlinear manifold.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a kinematic-free orientation control method for a deformable manipulator whose kinematic parameters are unknown.	Semantic Scholar
We estimate the Jacobian matrix by independently and incrementally actuating each joint and observing their effects on the orientation of the affected end-effector.	Semantic Scholar
Considering the nonlinear property, we generate a temporary and anticipant target by cutting a small distance on the geodesic in each control period, instead of using the target orientation directly.	Semantic Scholar
The geodesic is from the current orientation to the target orientation in $SO\left(3\right)$ .	Semantic Scholar
Our method guarantees global convergence and can automatically adapt to drastic changes in kinematic parameters, which is very difficult for model-based methods.	Semantic Scholar
Our method is implemented to control a 4-DOF deformable manipulator.	Semantic Scholar
The simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.	Semantic Scholar
This work investigates the relationship between scene and associated objects on daily activities under egocentric vision constraints.	Semantic Scholar
Daily activities are performed in prototypical scenes that share a lot of visual appearances independent of where or by whom the video was recorded.	Semantic Scholar
The intrinsic characteristics of egocentric vision suggest that the location where the activity is conducted remains consistent throughout frames.	Semantic Scholar
This paper shows that egocentric scene identification is improved by taking the temporal context into consideration.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, since most of the objects are typically associated with particular types of scenes, we show that a generic object detection method can also be improved by re-scoring the results of the object detection method according to the scene content.	Semantic Scholar
We first show the case where the scene identity is explicitly predicted to improve object detection, and then we show a framework using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) where no labeling of the scene type is needed.	Semantic Scholar
We performed experiments in the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) public dataset (Pirsiavash and Ramanan,2012), which is a standard benchmark for egocentric vision.	Semantic Scholar

Inspired by the oscillatory nature of cerebral cortex activity, we recently proposed and studied self-organizing maps (SOMs) based on limit cycle neural activity in an attempt to improve the information efficiency and robustness of conventional single-node, single-pattern representations.

Here we explore for the first time the use of limit cycle SOMs to build a neural architecture that controls a robotic arm by solving inverse kinematics in reach-and-hold tasks.	Semantic Scholar
This multi-map architecture integrates open-loop and closed-loop controls that learn to self-organize oscillatory neural representations and to harness non-fixed-point neural activity even for fixed-point arm reaching tasks.	Semantic Scholar
We show through computer simulations that our architecture generalizes well, achieves accurate, fast, and smooth arm movements, and is robust in the face of arm perturbations, map damage, and variations of internal timing parameters controlling the flow of activity.	Semantic Scholar
A robotic implementation is evaluated successfully without further training, demonstrating for the first time that limit cycle maps can control a physical robot arm.	Semantic Scholar
We conclude that architectures based on limit cycle maps can be organized to function effectively as neural controllers.	Semantic Scholar
A major driving force propelling the evolution of micrometer and millimeter scale robots is their eventual use in biological environments.	Semantic Scholar
Many advancements to microscale robotic technologies have shown that these small scale robots are well-suited for use in environments in which cells and cellular functions require physical manipulation or reprogramming.	Semantic Scholar
More specifically, microscale robots are poised for use in the delivery of small molecules, DNA vectors, and proteins which can edit cellular machinery and probe cell signaling systems.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we explore a unique approach to fabricate magnetic millimeter scale robots composed of a biological substrate.	Semantic Scholar

We demonstrate and characterize the swimming capabilities of this robot in media spanning orders of magnitude in viscosities at a range of rotational magnetic field frequencies.	Semantic Scholar
Our ability to operate in low Reynolds number environments shows that our system is also relevant to microscale robots.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we demonstrate the robot's inherent biocompatibility by establishing our ability to functionalize this robot with living cells and chemicals such that it can be used for biodelivery or to perform on-board biological experiments.	Semantic Scholar
The effects of leakage delay on the dynamics of neural networks with integer-order have lately been received considerable attention.	Semantic Scholar
It has been confirmed that fractional neural networks more appropriately uncover the dynamical properties of neural networks, but the results of fractional neural networks with leakage delay are relatively few.	Semantic Scholar
This paper primarily concentrates on the issue of bifurcation for high-order fractional bidirectional associative memory(BAM) neural networks involving leakage delay.	Semantic Scholar
The first attempt is made to tackle the stability and bifurcation of high-order fractional BAM neural networks with time delay in leakage terms in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
The conditions for the appearance of bifurcation for the proposed systems with leakage delay are firstly established by adopting time delay as a bifurcation parameter.	Semantic Scholar
Then, the bifurcation criteria of such system without leakage delay are successfully acquired.	Semantic Scholar
Comparative analysis wondrously detects that the stability performance of the proposed high-order fractional neural networks is critically weakened by leakage delay, they cannot be overlooked.	Semantic Scholar

This letter reports the concept and design of the active-braid, a novel bioinspired continuum manipulator with the ability to contract, extend, and bend in three-dimensional space with varying stiffness.	Semantic Scholar
The manipulator utilizes a flexible crossed-link helical array structure as its main supporting body, which is deformed by using two radial actuators and a total of six longitudinal tendons, analogously to the three major types of muscle layers found in muscular hydrostats.	Semantic Scholar
The helical array structure ensures that the manipulator behaves similarly to a constant volume structure (expanding while shortening and contracting while elongating).	Semantic Scholar
Numerical simulations and experimental prototypes are used in order to evaluate the feasibility of the concept.	Semantic Scholar
This work presents an efficient framework to generate a motion plan of a robot with high degrees of freedom (e.g., a humanoid robot).	Semantic Scholar
High dimensionality of the robot configuration space often leads to difficulties in utilizing the widely used motion planning algorithms, since the volume of the decision space increases exponentially with the number of dimensions.	Semantic Scholar
To handle complications arising from the large decision space, and to solve a corresponding motion planning problem efficiently, two key concepts are adopted in this work: First, the Gaussian process latent variable model (GP-LVM) is utilized for low-dimensional representation of the original configuration space.	Semantic Scholar
Second, an approximate inference algorithm is used, exploiting through the duality between control and estimation, to explore the decision space and to compute a high-quality motion trajectory of the robot.	Semantic Scholar
Utilizing the GP-LVM and the duality between control and estimation, we construct a fully probabilistic generative model with which a high-dimensional motion planning problem is transformed into a tractable inference problem.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we compute the motion trajectory via an approximate inference algorithm based on a variant of the particle filter.	Semantic Scholar
Understanding the irregular crowd movement and social activities caused by urban events such as city festivals and concerts can benefit event management and city planning.	Semantic Scholar
Although various urban data can be exploited to detect such irregularities, the crowd mobility data (e.g., bike trip records) are usually in a mixed state with several basic patterns (e.g., eating, working, and recreation), making it difficult to separate concurrent events happening in the same region.	Semantic Scholar
The social activity data (e.g., social network check-ins) are usually oversparse, hindering the fine-grained characterization of urban events.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a tensor cofactorization-based data fusion framework for fine-grained urban event detection and characterization leveraging crowd mobility data and social activity data.	Semantic Scholar
First, we adopt a nonnegative tensor cofactorization approach to decompose the crowd mobility tensor into several basic patterns, with the help of the auxiliary social activity tensor.	Semantic Scholar
We then use a multivariate-outlier-detection-based method to identify irregularities from the decomposed basic patterns and aggregate them to detect and characterize the associated urban events.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate the performance of our framework using real-world bike trip data and check-in data from New York City and Washington, DC, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that by fusing the two types of urban data, our method achieves fine-grained urban event detection and characterization in both cities and consistently outperforms the baselines.	Semantic Scholar

Smartphones and smart homes incorporate sensors that can record this information without significant inconvenience to the user.	Semantic Scholar
Algorithms were developed to classify activity postures to infer current situations; and to measure user's physical location, in order to provide context that assists such interpretation.	Semantic Scholar
Location was detected using a subarea-mapping algorithm; activity classification was performed using a hierarchical algorithm with backward reasoning; and falls were detected using fused multiple contexts (current posture, posture transition, location, and heart rate) based on two models: “certain fall” and “possible fall.” The approaches were evaluated on nine volunteers using a smartphone, which provided accelerometer and orientation data, and a radio frequency identification network deployed at an indoor environment.

Experimental results illustrated falls detection sensitivity of 94.7% and specificity of 85.7%.	Semantic Scholar

Goal: Lifting is a common manual material handling task performed in the workplaces.	Semantic Scholar
It is considered as one of the main risk factors for work-related musculoskeletal disorders.	Semantic Scholar
An important criterion to identify the unsafe lifting task is the values of the net force and moment at L5/S1 joint.	Semantic Scholar
These values are mainly calculated in a laboratory environment, which utilizes marker-based sensors to collect three-dimensional (3-D) information and force plates to measure the external forces and moments.	Semantic Scholar
However, this method is usually expensive to set up, time-consuming in process, and sensitive to the surrounding environment.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we propose a deep neural network (DNN)-based framework for 3-D pose estimation, which addresses the aforementioned limitations, and we employ the results for L5/S1 moment and force calculation.	Semantic Scholar
Methods: At the first step of the proposed framework, full body 3-D pose is captured using a DNN, then at the second step, estimated 3-D body pose along with the subject's anthropometric information is utilized to calculate L5/S1 join's kinetic by a top-down inverse dynamic algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Results: To fully evaluate our approach, we conducted experiments using a lifting dataset consisting of 12 subjects performing various types of lifting tasks.	Semantic Scholar
The results are validated against a marker-based motion capture system as a reference.	Semantic Scholar
The grand mean ± SD of the total moment/force absolute errors across all the dataset was 9.06 ± 7.60 N·m/4.85 ± 4.85 N. Conclusion: The proposed method provides a reliable tool for assessment of the lower back kinetics during lifting and can be an alternative when the use of marker-based motion capture systems is not possible.

This work develops a generic framework, called the bag-of-paths (BoP), for link and network data analysis.	Semantic Scholar
The central idea is to assign a probability distribution on the set of all paths in a network.	Semantic Scholar
More precisely, a Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution is defined over a bag of paths in a network, that is, on a representation that considers all paths independently.	Semantic Scholar
We show that, under this distribution, the probability of drawing a path connecting two nodes can easily be computed in closed form by simple matrix inversion.	Semantic Scholar
This probability captures a notion of relatedness, or more precisely accessibility, between nodes of the graph: two nodes are considered as highly related when they are connected by many, preferably low-cost, paths.	Semantic Scholar
As an application, two families of distances between nodes are derived from the BoP probabilities.	Semantic Scholar
Interestingly, the second distance family interpolates between the shortest-path distance and the commute-cost distance.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, it extends the Bellman-Ford formula for computing the shortest-path distance in order to integrate sub-optimal paths (exploration) by simply replacing the minimum operator by the soft minimum operator.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on semi-supervised classification tasks show that both of the new distance families are competitive with other state-of-the-art approaches.	Semantic Scholar
In addition to the distance measures studied in this paper, the bag-of-paths framework enables straightforward computation of many other relevant network measures.	Semantic Scholar

For evaluation, surface electromyographical signals were first used to study the effect of force feedback on associated muscle activation.	Semantic Scholar
Average % maximum voluntary isometric contraction of all subjects showed statistically reduced muscle activity in at least one associated muscle while performing all motions, enabled with actuators.	Semantic Scholar
Second, the force feedback generated by the glove at the user's wrist has been modeled using experiments with a force transducer.	Semantic Scholar
An application was then developed where the user was given the ability to interact with virtual objects and receive feedback through the glove.	Semantic Scholar
The evaluation of the feasibility of this application was done by measuring and comparing force profiles while generating an equal force in an ideal and a predicted environment.	Semantic Scholar
Spherical parallel manipulators can be effectively used for the execution of pointing tasks provided that their functional redundancy is well exploited.	Semantic Scholar
The present letter shows how the dynamic behavior of parallel wrists can be enhanced by optimizing their posture through suitable performance indexes; the indexes used in this letter are based on the manipulator inertia matrix reduced to the mobile platform, which can be readily worked out from the total kinetic energy of the wrist.

First, the redundancy is solved by finding, for each pointing direction, the posture leading to the best dynamic manipulation capacity.	Semantic Scholar
Then, a path is planned on the surface of a sphere by means of Bézier curves; in this case, the performance function of the optimization problem drives the platform through the spherical attitudes that grant the maximum angular accelerations along a useful direction.	Semantic Scholar

The features of interest points, detected by the SURF algorithm in subsequent frames, are used to identify the properties of object and calculate the object’s changes.	Semantic Scholar
To determine the object’s slippage, nine detecting windows in the camera view can detect nine tracks of the slippage.	Semantic Scholar
Besides, the object’s distortion and direction of tangential force on the surface can be determined from these tracks, which helps to the estimation of the object’s damage.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on homogeneous and textured materials show that this method can detect the object’ slippage accurately, and meanwhile provides the tracks of the slippage, distortion information and the force situation.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, tests for comparison were carried out and the results show that this sensor has a high accuracy in detecting slippage and distortion and the error is acceptable, which has an significant impact in deformable object grasp.	Semantic Scholar

Our network that employs neurons operating at sparse biological spike rates below 300Hz achieves a classification accuracy of 98.17% on the MNIST test database with four times fewer parameters compared to the state-of-the-art.	Semantic Scholar
We present several insights from extensive numerical experiments regarding optimization of learning parameters and network configuration to improve its accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
We also describe a number of strategies to optimize the SNN for implementation in memory and energy constrained hardware, including approximations in computing the neuronal dynamics and reduced precision in storing the synaptic weights.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments reveal that even with 3-bit synaptic weights, the classification accuracy of the designed SNN does not degrade beyond 1% as compared to the floating-point baseline.	Semantic Scholar
Further, the proposed SNN, which is trained based on the precise spike timing information outperforms an equivalent non-spiking artificial neural network (ANN) trained using back propagation, especially at low bit precision.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, our study shows the potential for realizing efficient neuromorphic systems that use spike based information encoding and learning for real-world applications.	Semantic Scholar
We study with numerical simulation the possible limit behaviors of synchronous discrete-time deterministic recurrent neural networks composed of N binary neurons as a function of a network’s level of dilution and asymmetry.	Semantic Scholar
The network dilution measures the fraction of neuron couples that are connected, and the network asymmetry measures to what extent the underlying connectivity matrix is asymmetric.	Semantic Scholar
For each given neural network, we study the dynamical evolution of all the different initial conditions, thus characterizing the full dynamical landscape without imposing any learning rule.	Semantic Scholar
Because of the deterministic dynamics, each trajectory converges to an attractor, that can be either a fixed point or a limit cycle.	Semantic Scholar
These attractors form the set of all the possible limit behaviors of the neural network.	Semantic Scholar

We show that there are two network structures that maximize the number of possible limit behaviors.	Semantic Scholar
The first optimal network structure is fully-connected and symmetric.	Semantic Scholar
On the contrary, the second optimal network structure is highly sparse and asymmetric.	Semantic Scholar
The latter optimal is similar to what observed in different biological neuronal circuits.	Semantic Scholar
These observations lead us to hypothesize that independently from any given learning model, an efficient and effective biologic network that stores a number of limit behaviors close to its maximum capacity tends to develop a connectivity structure similar to one of the optimal networks we found.

This paper presents a neurodynamic approach to nonlinear optimization problems with affine equality and convex inequality constraints.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed neural network endows with a time-varying auxiliary function, which can guarantee that the state of the neural network enters the feasible region in finite time and remains there thereafter.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the state with any initial point is shown to be convergent to the critical point set when the objective function is generally nonconvex.	Semantic Scholar
Especially, when the objective function is pseudoconvex (or convex), the state is proved to be globally convergent to an optimal solution of the considered optimization problem.	Semantic Scholar
Compared with other neural networks for related optimization problems, the proposed neural network in this paper has good convergence and does not depend on some additional assumptions, such as the assumption that the inequality feasible region is bounded, the assumption that the penalty parameter is sufficiently large and the assumption that the objective function is lower bounded over the equality feasible region.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, some numerical examples and an application in real-time data reconciliation are provided to display the well performance of the proposed neural network.	Semantic Scholar
The existing methods for registration of point clouds acquired by laser scanners have some limitations.	Semantic Scholar
Firstly, as samples of surface, a point cloud acquired by laser scanner, which normally works in a spherical fashion, has very limited density when the surface is far away from the laser scanner and the density varies a lot at different ranges.	Semantic Scholar
Current registration methods cannot accurately model the surface uncertainty for such kind of point clouds of limited and large varying density.	Semantic Scholar
Secondly, when the point cloud is acquired while the platform is simultaneously moving, the estimation error of the platform motion makes the acquired point cloud distorted.	Semantic Scholar
To deal with these problems, in this paper, we propose an uncertainty model based on the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to represent the point cloud.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we construct the GMM piece-wisely on the underlying surface of point cloud, which will accurately model the surface uncertainty.	Semantic Scholar
Also a hierarchical structure is employed to increase the robustness of the registration.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, by assigning each Gaussian component with a pose, a probabilistic graph can be constructed to tackle the problem of registration when the platform is moving while scanning.	Semantic Scholar
In this way the distorted point cloud, caused by the estimation error of the platform’s motion, can be corrected by performing graph optimization.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation and real world experimental results show that our method leads to better convergence than the state-of-the-art methods due to the accurate modeling of the surface uncertainty and the hierarchical structure, and it also enables us to correct the distorted point clouds.	Semantic Scholar

Bio-inspired flying robots (BIFRs) are micro-air-vehicles that use biomimetic actuation (oscillatory flapping wing) for lift, propulsion, and control.	Semantic Scholar
The dynamic behavior of these bio-inspired systems is quite intricate to study as it is typically described by a multibody, multi-time-scale, nonlinear, time-varying dynamical system.	Semantic Scholar
However, this rich dynamics lead to unconventional stabilization mechanisms whose study essentially necessitates a mathematically rigorous analysis.	Semantic Scholar
Our recent efforts using differential geometric control theory revealed a vibrational stabilization mechanism induced on the body pitching due to the interaction between the fast wing flapping dynamics and the slow body dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
In this effort, we construct an experimental setup allowing for two degrees of freedom for the body; vertical motion and pitching motion.	Semantic Scholar
The objective is to experimentally verify and demonstrate the vibrational stabilization phenomenon in insect flight and its mimicking BIFRs.	Semantic Scholar
User-centered design (UCD) is an approach for creating human–machine interfaces that are usable and support the human operator's tasks.	Semantic Scholar
UCD can be challenging because designers can fail to account for human–machine interactions that occur due to the concurrency between the human and the other system elements.	Semantic Scholar
Formal methods are tools that enable analysts to consider all of the possible system interactions using a combination of formal modeling, specification, and proof-based verification.	Semantic Scholar
However, creating formal interface design models can be extremely difficult.	Semantic Scholar
This work describes a method that supports UCD by automatically generating formal designs of human–machine interface behavior from task-analytic models.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting interface design will always support the behavior captured in the task model.	Semantic Scholar
This paper describes the method and demonstrates its capabilities with three case studies: a light switch, a vending machine, and a patient-controlled analgesia pump.	Semantic Scholar
The produced designs are validated with formal verifications to prove that they support their associated tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Results and future research are discussed.	Semantic Scholar
During the last decade, community-based question answering (CQA) sites have accumulated a vast amount of questions and their crowdsourced answers over time.	Semantic Scholar
How to efficiently identify the quality of answers that are relevant to a given question has become an active line of research in CQA.	Semantic Scholar
The major challenge of CQA is the accurate selection of high-quality answers w.r.t given questions.	Semantic Scholar
Previous approaches tend to model the semantic matching between individual pair of one question and its corresponding answer (how fitting an answer is to a posted question).	Semantic Scholar
However, these works ignore the temporal interactions between answers (how previous answers influence the late posted answers).	Semantic Scholar
For example, a rational user likely adapts others’ opinions, revises his inclinations, and posts a more appropriate answer after understanding the given question and previously posted answers.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, this paper devises an architecture named Temporal Interaction and Causal Influence LSTM (TC-LSTM) to effectively leverage not only the causal influence between question-answer (how appropriate an answer is for a given question) but also the temporal interactions between answers-answer (how a high-quality answer gradually forms).	Semantic Scholar
In particular, long short-term memory (LSTM) is used to capture the explicit question-answer influence and the implicit answers-answer interactions.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments are conducted on SemEval 2015 CQA dataset for answer classification task and Baidu Zhidao Dataset for answer ranking task.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results show the advantage of our model comparing with other state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
Color-depth cameras (RGB-D cameras) have become the primary sensors in most robotics systems, from service robotics to industrial robotics applications.	Semantic Scholar
Typical consumer-grade RGB-D cameras are provided with a coarse intrinsic and extrinsic calibration that generally does not meet the accuracy requirements needed by many robotics applications [e.g., highly accurate three-dimensional (3-D) environment reconstruction and mapping, high precision object recognition, localization, etc.].	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a human-friendly, reliable, and accurate calibration framework that enables to easily estimate both the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of a general color-depth sensor couple.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach is based on a novel two components error model.	Semantic Scholar
This model unifies the error sources of RGB-D pairs based on different technologies, such as structured-light 3-D cameras and time-of-flight cameras.	Semantic Scholar
Our method provides some important advantages compared to other state-of-the-art systems: It is general (i.e., well suited for different types of sensors), based on an easy and stable calibration protocol, provides a greater calibration accuracy, and has been implemented within the robot operating system robotics framework.

We report detailed experimental validations and performance comparisons to support our statements.	Semantic Scholar

The hammering test is a traditional nondestructive testing method that has been employed in the field for a long time and for which automation is highly desirable.	Semantic Scholar
The problem consists in determining from the sound returned after a hammer strike on a structure's surface if there is a defect beneath or not.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present an unsupervised learning approach for the automation of hammering test.	Semantic Scholar
First, mean shift is used with Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients at various parameter values in order to find a stable mode configuration.	Semantic Scholar
Then, the corresponding peaks are used to obtain seeds for spatial fuzzy c-means to cluster hammering samples while combining audio and position information.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments have been conducted in indoor artificial environment on concrete blocks containing man-made defects.	Semantic Scholar
Results showed the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed solution on detecting different types and number of defects.	Semantic Scholar

An important issue in anomaly detection in smart manufacturing systems is the lack of consistency in the formal definitions of anomalies, faults, and attacks.	Semantic Scholar
The term anomaly is used to cover a wide range of situations that are addressed by different types of solutions.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we categorize anomalies in machines, controllers, and networks along with their detection mechanisms, and unify them under a common framework to aid in the identification of potential solutions.	Semantic Scholar
The main contribution of the proposed categorization is that it allows the identification of gaps in anomaly detection in smart manufacturing systems.	Semantic Scholar
In a hospital's intensive care unit (ICU), multidisciplinary rounding (MDR) is a combination of care management with various healthcare providers from different clinical expertise meeting together to coordinate patient care, establish daily goals, and determine treatment plans.	Semantic Scholar
Such meetings require significant time and resource utilization from the providers.	Semantic Scholar
However, despite its significance, the workflow of MDR has not yet been rigorously studied.	Semantic Scholar
Using the data collected in ICUs at Mayo Clinic, this letter studies the MDR process by introducing a continuous time Markov chain model to systematically analyze the workflow and provide guidelines for efficiency improvement.	Semantic Scholar
In addition to evaluating current MDR process, a bottleneck analysis method is introduced to identify the task or activity whose improvement can lead to the largest gain in system performance.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the findings in bottleneck analysis, a potential MDR workflow redesign is proposed, which shifts resident's education time to a separate session out of normal rounding.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel feature extraction approach for 3D facial expression recognition by incorporating non-rigid registration in face-model-free analysis, which in turn makes feasible data-driven, i.e., featuremodel-free recognition of expressions.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting simplicity of feature representation is due to the fact that facial information is adapted to the input faces via shape model-free dense registration, and this provides a dynamic feature extraction mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
This approach eliminates the necessity of complex feature representations as required in the case of static feature extraction methods, where the complexity arises from the necessity to model the local context; higher degree of complexity persists in deep feature hierarchies enabled by end-to-end learning on large-scale datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Face-model-free recognition implies independence from limitations and biases due to committed face models, bypassing complications of model fitting, and avoiding the burden of manual model construction.	Semantic Scholar
We show via information gain maps that non-rigid registration enables extraction of highly informative features, as it provides invariance to localshifts due to physiognomy (subject invariance) and residual pose misalignments; in addition, it allows estimation of local correspondences of expressions.	Semantic Scholar
To maximize the recognition rate, we use the strategy of employing a rich but computationally manageable set of local correspondence structures, and to this effect we propose a framework to optimally select multiple registration references.	Semantic Scholar
Our features are re-sampled surface curvature values at individual coordinates which are chosen per expression-class and per reference pair.	Semantic Scholar
We show the superior performance of our novel dynamic feature extraction approach on three distinct recognition problems, namely, action unit detection, basic expression recognition, and emotion dimension recognition.	Semantic Scholar

Distance metric learning has been a hot research spot recently due to its high effectiveness and efficiency in improving the performance of distance related methods, such as k nearest neighbors (kNN).	Semantic Scholar
Metric learning aims to learn a data-dependent metric to make intra-class distance smaller and inter-class larger.	Semantic Scholar
A large number of methods have been proposed for various applications and a survey to evaluate and compare these methods is imperative.	Semantic Scholar
The existing surveys just analyze the algorithms theoretically or compare them experimentally with a narrow time scope.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, the paper reviews classical and influential methods that were proposed between 2003 and 2017 and presents a taxonomy based on the most distinct character of each method.	Semantic Scholar
All the methods are categorized into five classes, including pairwise cost, probabilistic framework, boost-like approaches, advantageous variants and specific applications.	Semantic Scholar
A comprehensive experimental study is made to compare all the selected methods, exploring the ability in improving accuracy, the relation between distance change and accuracy, the relation between accuracy and kNN neighbor size.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce the concept of regular expression characteristics as a unified way to concisely express bounds on time-series constraints.	Semantic Scholar
This allows us not only to define time-series constraints in a compositional way, but also to deal with their combinatorial aspect in a compositional way, without developing ad-hoc bounds for each time-series constraint separately.	Semantic Scholar
As semiconductor manufacturing processes are becoming more and more sophisticated, how to maintain their feasible production yield becomes an important issue.	Semantic Scholar
Also, how to build a smart manufacturing platform that can facilitate realizing smart factories is essential and desirable for current manufacturing industries.	Semantic Scholar
Aimed at addressing the above-mentioned two issues, in this letter, a five-stage approach for enhancing and assuring yield is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
Also, a smart manufacturing platform- Advanced Manufacturing Cloud of Things (AMCoT) based on Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data analytics, cyber-physical systems, and prediction technologies is designed and implemented to realize the proposed five-stage approach of yield enhancement and assurance.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, AMCoT is applied to a bumping process of a semiconductor company in Taiwan to conduct industrial case studies.	Semantic Scholar
Testing results demonstrate that AMCoT possesses capabilities of conducting total inspection in production, providing prognosis, and predictive maintenance on equipment, finding the root cause of yield loss, and storing and handling big production data, which as a whole is promising to achieve the goal of zero defects.

Focused ion beam (FIB) tomography provides high resolution volumetric images on a micro scale.	Semantic Scholar
However, due to the physical acquisition process the resulting images are often corrupted by a so-called curtaining or waterfall effect.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a new convex variational model for removing such effects is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
More precisely, an infimal convolution model is applied to split the corrupted 3D image into the clean image and two types of corruptions, namely a striped part and a laminar one.	Semantic Scholar
In order to accomplish the decomposition we exploit the fact that the single parts have certain spatial structures, which are penalized by different first and second order differences.	Semantic Scholar
By doing so, our approach generalizes discrete unidirectional total variational (TV) approaches.	Semantic Scholar
A minimizer of the proposed model is computed by well-known primal dual techniques.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical examples show the very good performance of our new method for artificial as well as real-world data.	Semantic Scholar
Besides FIB tomography, we have also successfully applied our technique for the removal of pure stripes in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data.	Semantic Scholar

The robotic sheet consists of a ferrofluid wrapped with thin polytetrafluoroethylene films.	Semantic Scholar
The robotic sheet automatically transports a target liquid using the deformation characteristics of ferrofluid subject to the influence of a magnetic field, and moves it to targeted locations via a visual feedback control with a camera.	Semantic Scholar
Based on previous findings regarding the flexibility of robotic sheets, the proposed system could manually move a target liquid, such as water.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, the authors elucidate the feasibility of the automatic manipulation and behavior of the target liquid during manipulation.	Semantic Scholar
The authors also quantify liquid mixing and explain the effect of the oscillation characteristics on the result.	Semantic Scholar
This work bridges the gap between two popular methodologies for data partitioning: kernel clustering and regularization-based segmentation.	Semantic Scholar
While addressing closely related practical problems, these general methodologies may seem very different based on how they are covered in the literature.	Semantic Scholar
The differences may show up in motivation, formulation, and optimization, e.g.	Semantic Scholar
spectral relaxation versus max-flow.	Semantic Scholar
We explain how regularization and kernel clustering can work together and why this is useful.	Semantic Scholar
Our joint energy combines standard regularization, e.g.	Semantic Scholar
MRF potentials, and kernel clustering criteria like normalized cut.	Semantic Scholar
Complementarity of such terms is demonstrated in many applications using our bound optimization Kernel Cut algorithm for the joint energy (code is publicly available).	Semantic Scholar
While detailing combinatorial move-making, our main focus are new linear kernel and spectral bounds for kernel clustering criteria allowing their integration with any regularization objectives with existing discrete or continuous solvers.	Semantic Scholar
Deep-Learning has become a leading strategy for artificial intelligence and is being applied in many fields due to its excellent performance that has surpassed human cognitive abilities in a number of classification and control problems (Ciregan, Meier, & Schmidhuber, 2012; Mnih et al., 2015).	Semantic Scholar
However, the training process of Deep-Learning is usually slow and requires high-performance computing, capable of handling large datasets.	Semantic Scholar
The optimization of the training method can improve the learning rate of the Deep-Learning networks and result in a higher performance while using the same number of training epochs (cycles).	Semantic Scholar
This paper considers the use of estimation theory for training of large neural networks and in particular Deep-Learning networks.	Semantic Scholar
Two estimation strategies namely the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the Smooth Variable Structure Filter (SVSF) have been revised (subsequently referred to as RSVSF and REKF) and used for network training.	Semantic Scholar
They are applied to several benchmark datasets and comparatively evaluated.	Semantic Scholar
"An important question for production engineers is, ""How do I automate this task?"""	Semantic Scholar
In traditional industrial automation, e.g., a car factory, robots perform a small set of tasks for long periods of time.	Semantic Scholar
Robots are selected because their kinematic structure and strength suit the task requirements, and their motions are preprogrammed by a skilled programmer.	Semantic Scholar
In flexible manufacturing environments, tasks can change daily or hourly.	Semantic Scholar
The classic approach to automation is less suitable here; buying a dedicated robot for each set of tasks is inefficient, and coding each task is very time-consuming.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, qualified programmers with the requisite knowledge may not be available.	Semantic Scholar
To solve these problems, we propose a framework for modular robots that determines their structure and program based on human demonstrations.	Semantic Scholar
Customization is an important issue for assistive gloves because it affects glove performance.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose an assembly based customizable soft pneumatic assistive glove, named Exo-Glove PM.	Semantic Scholar
Pneumatic soft robots generally consist of a single structure with embedded actuators.	Semantic Scholar
However, when assembled, the region where the assemblies are connected easily undergoes large stress concentration that leads to failure.	Semantic Scholar
To overcome this issue, we have developed a hybrid actuator module that combines a soft actuation structure and rigid joining methods.	Semantic Scholar
In general, rigid joining methods require a bulky design to enable easy assembly, but Exo-Glove PM is designed to create pathways for assembly tools to access the bolt heads by bending certain parts.	Semantic Scholar
This novel way of joining assemblies allows soft robots to be built of multiple parts while minimizing the volume.	Semantic Scholar
It ensures small module size and enables modules to cover a wide range of hand sizes; the distance between each module is matched to the length of the user's phalanges using spacers.	Semantic Scholar
This approach allows users to customize the glove by assembly of standardized modules and maximizes the comfort and the performance of the glove without custom manufacturing and, thus, reduces costs.	Semantic Scholar
A control strategy is proposed to deal with the fundamental gain selection problem of optical flow landings.	Semantic Scholar
It involves detecting the height by means of an oscillating movement and setting the control gains accordingly at the start of a landing.	Semantic Scholar

Real-world experiments with a quadrotor demonstrate successful landings in both indoor and outdoor environments.	Semantic Scholar

We fabricated an identical control actuator using molding and 3-D printing techniques for comparison.	Semantic Scholar
By comparing the free space elongation and fixed length force of both actuators, we were able to evaluate the quality of the print.	Semantic Scholar
We observed that the 3-D printed linear actuator was able to perform similarly to the molded actuator, with an average error of 5.08% in actuator response, establishing the feasibility of such a system.	Semantic Scholar
We envision that further development of this system would contribute to the way soft robotic systems are fabricated.	Semantic Scholar
We address the problem of 3D shape completion from sparse and noisy point clouds, a fundamental problem in computer vision and robotics.	Semantic Scholar
Recent approaches are either data-driven or learning-based: Data-driven approaches rely on a shape model whose parameters are optimized to fit the observations; Learning-based approaches, in contrast, avoid the expensive optimization step by learning to directly predict complete shapes from incomplete observations in a fully-supervised setting.	Semantic Scholar
However, full supervision is often not available in practice.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we propose a weakly-supervised learning-based approach to 3D shape completion which neither requires slow optimization nor direct supervision.	Semantic Scholar
While we also learn a shape prior on synthetic data, we amortize, i.e., learn, maximum likelihood fitting using deep neural networks resulting in efficient shape completion without sacrificing accuracy.	Semantic Scholar

We address the problem of automatically learning to classify texts by exploiting information derived from meta-features, i.e., features derived from the original bag-of-words representation.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we provide an in-depth analysis on the recently proposed distance-based meta-features, a data engineering technique that relies on the distance between documents to transform the original feature space into a new one, potentially smaller and more informed.	Semantic Scholar
Despite its potential, the meta-feature space may be unnecessarily complex and highly dimensional, which increases the tendency of overfitting, limits the application of meta-features in different contexts, and increases computational costs.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we propose the use of multi-objective strategies to reduce the number of meta-features while maximizing the classification effectiveness, when considering the adequacy of the selected meta-features to a particular dataset or classification method.	Semantic Scholar
We present effective and efficient proposals for meta-feature selection that can substantially reduce the number of meta-features by up to 89 percent while keeping or improving the classification effectiveness, something not possible with any of the evaluated baselines.	Semantic Scholar
We also use our selection strategies as evaluation tools to analyze different combinations of meta-features.	Semantic Scholar
We found very compact combinations of meta-features that can achieve high classification effectiveness in most datasets, despite their peculiarities.	Semantic Scholar
Recent direct visual odometry and SLAM algorithms have demonstrated impressive levels of precision.	Semantic Scholar
However, they require a photometric camera calibration in order to achieve competitive results.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, the respective algorithm cannot be directly applied to an off-the-shelf-camera or to a video sequence acquired with an unknown camera.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a method for online photometric calibration that enables to process auto exposure videos with visual odometry precisions that are on par with those of photometrically calibrated videos.	Semantic Scholar
Our algorithm recovers the exposure times of consecutive frames, the camera response function, and the attenuation factors of the sensor irradiance due to vignetting.	Semantic Scholar
Gain robust Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) feature tracks are used to obtain scene point correspondences as input to a nonlinear optimization framework.	Semantic Scholar
We show that our approach can reliably calibrate arbitrary video sequences by evaluating it on datasets for which full photometric ground truth is available.	Semantic Scholar
We further show that our calibration can improve the performance of a state-of-the-art direct visual odometry method that works solely on pixel intensities, calibrating for photometric parameters in an online fashion in realtime.	Semantic Scholar
As the application of probabilistic models in robotic applications increases, a systematic robot control approach considering the effects of uncertainty becomes indispensable.	Semantic Scholar
Inspired by human sensorimotor findings, in this paper, we study the stochastic optimal control problem with high-order cost statistics in order to synthesize uncertainty-dependent actions in robotic scenarios with multiple uncertainty sources.	Semantic Scholar
We present locally optimal risk-sensitive and cost-cumulant solutions for settings with nonlinear dynamics, multiple additive uncertainty sources, and nonquadratic costs.	Semantic Scholar
The influence of each uncertainty source on the cost can be individually parameterized offering additional flexibility in the control design.	Semantic Scholar
We further analyze the case in which the static uncertain parameters are involved.	Semantic Scholar
The simulations of several linear and nonlinear settings with nonquadratic costs and an experiment on a real robotic platform validate our approach and illustrate its peculiarities.	Semantic Scholar
For autonomous navigation in difficult terrain, such as degraded environments in disaster response scenarios, robots are required to create a map of an unknown environment and to localize within this map.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we describe our approach to simultaneous localization and mapping that is based on the measurements of a 3D laser-range finder.	Semantic Scholar
We aggregate laser-range measurements by registering sparse 3D scans with a local multiresolution surfel map that has high resolution in the vicinity of the robot and coarser resolutions with increasing distance, which corresponds well to measurement density and accuracy of our sensor.

By modeling measurements by surface elements, our approach allows for efficient and accurate registration and leverages online mapping and localization.	Semantic Scholar
The incrementally built local dense 3D maps of nearby key poses are registered against each other.	Semantic Scholar
Graph optimization yields a globally consistent dense 3D map of the environment.	Semantic Scholar
Continuous registration of local maps with the global map allows for tracking the 6D robot pose in real time.	Semantic Scholar
We assess the drivability of the terrain by analyzing height differences in an allocentric height map and plan cost-optimal paths.	Semantic Scholar
The system has been successfully demonstrated during the DARPA Robotics Challenge and the DLR SpaceBot Camp.	Semantic Scholar
In experiments, we evaluate accuracy and efficiency of our approach.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes two new non-reference image quality metrics that can be adopted by the state-of-the-art image/video denoising algorithms for auto-denoising.	Semantic Scholar
The first metric is proposed based on the assumption that the noise should be independent of the original image.	Semantic Scholar
A direct measurement of this dependence is, however, impractical due to the relatively low accuracy of existing denoising method.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed metric thus tackles the homogeneous regions and highly-structured regions separately.	Semantic Scholar
Nevertheless, this metric is only stable when the noise level is relatively low.	Semantic Scholar
Most denoising algorithms reduce noise by (weighted) averaging repeated noisy measurements.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, another metric is proposed for high-level noise based on the fact that more noisy measurements will be required when the noise level increases.	Semantic Scholar
The number of measurements before converging is thus related to the quality of noisy images.	Semantic Scholar
Our patch-matching based metric proposes to iteratively find and add noisy image measurements for averaging until there is no visible difference between two successively averaged images.	Semantic Scholar
Both metrics are evaluated on LIVE2 (Sheikh et al.	Semantic Scholar

We present a novel method for efficient querying and retrieval of arbitrarily shaped objects from large amounts of unstructured 3D point cloud data.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach first performs a convex segmentation of the data after which local features are extracted and stored in a feature dictionary.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the representation allows efficient and reliable querying of the data.	Semantic Scholar
To handle arbitrarily shaped objects, we propose a scheme which allows incremental matching of segments based on similarity to the query object.	Semantic Scholar

We perform extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two datasets for both segmentation and retrieval, validating the results using ground truth data.	Semantic Scholar
Comparison with other state of the art methods further enforces the validity of the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we also investigate how the density and distribution of the local features within the point clouds influence the quality of the results.	Semantic Scholar

Learning control policies has become an appealing alternative to the derivation of control laws based on classic control theory.	Semantic Scholar
Value iteration approaches have proven an outstanding flexibility, while maintaining high data efficiency when combined with probabilistic models to eliminate model bias.	Semantic Scholar
However, a major difficulty for these methods is that the state and action spaces must typically be discretized and often the value function update is analytically intractable.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a projection based approximate value iteration approach, that employs numerical quadrature for the value function update step.	Semantic Scholar
It can handle continuous state and action spaces and noisy measurements of the system dynamics while learning globally optimal control from scratch.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the proposed approximation technique allows for upper bounds on the approximation error, which can be used to guarantee convergence of the proposed approach to an optimal policy under some assumptions.	Semantic Scholar
Empirical evaluations on the mountain benchmark problem show the efficiency of the proposed approach and support our theoretical results.	Semantic Scholar
There are various kinds of indices to evaluate collision risk against forward obstacles, which are used to determine the timing of collision warning provision in forward obstacle collision warning systems (FCWSs) and advanced emergency braking systems.	Semantic Scholar
A previous study proposed a deceleration for collision avoidance (DCA) method, which can evaluate a collision risk more precisely than other conventional indices.	Semantic Scholar
However, the calculation process of DCA assumed that a following vehicle (FV) performs a uniform motion within a driver's constant reaction time.	Semantic Scholar
The assumption causes underestimation of collision risk when the FV accelerates and overestimation when it decelerates.	Semantic Scholar
Consequently, this paper shows a detailed calculation process of an improved DCA based on an expanded assumption that the FV maintains a uniformly accelerated motion within the reaction time.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, stimulus-response experiments were conducted to measure the driver's reaction time when he/she adjusts the brake pedal depression.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical simulations, where DCA is used for the FCWS, were performed to show that the improved DCA (with a new setting for the driver reaction time) describes the collision risk more properly compared to the conventional DCA.	Semantic Scholar
Bio-inspired designs are motivated by efficiency, adaptability, and robustness of biological systems’ dynamic behaviors in complex environment.	Semantic Scholar

Dimensionality reduction has demonstrated in recent robotics research to solve problems that affect high degrees of freedom devices.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, a survey on the role of dimensionality reduction in learning and control strategies is provided by discussing different techniques adopted for dimensionality reduction, as well as learning and control strategies built on subspaces of reduced dimension across different fully actuated and underactuated anthropomorphic designs.

Poor balance control and falls are big issues for older adults that due to aging decline have a lower postural balance and directional control in balance performance than younger age groups.	Semantic Scholar
The four square step test (FSST) was developed to evaluate rapid stepping that is often required when changing direction and avoiding obstacles while walking.	Semantic Scholar
However, previous researchers used only the total time as the assessment in the test.	Semantic Scholar
The aim of this letter is to objectively quantify the sequence and direction of the steps in FSST, by using two inertial sensors placed on both feet.	Semantic Scholar
An algorithm was developed to automatically segment the steps performed during the test, and calculate the stepping direction from the linear velocity of the foot.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments were conducted with 100 Japanese healthy older adults, where sensor data and video of 20 subjects were randomly subtracted for algorithm verification.	Semantic Scholar
The results showed that the algorithm succeeded for 71.7% trials in recognizing both the step sequence and step direction in FSST, while 90.2% of the detection failure could be excluded with an auto verification method.	Semantic Scholar
Recurrent backpropagation and equilibrium propagation are supervised learning algorithms for fixed-point recurrent neural networks, which differ in their second phase.	Semantic Scholar
In the first phase, both algorithms converge to a fixed point that corresponds to the configuration where the prediction is made.	Semantic Scholar
In the second phase, equilibrium propagation relaxes to another nearby fixed point corresponding to smaller prediction error, whereas recurrent backpropagation uses a side network to compute error derivatives iteratively.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we establish a close connection between these two algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
We show that at every moment in the second phase, the temporal derivatives of the neural activities in equilibrium propagation are equal to the error derivatives computed iteratively by recurrent backpropagation in the side network.	Semantic Scholar
This work shows that it is not required to have a side network for the computation of error derivatives and supports the hypothesis that in biological neural networks, temporal derivatives of neural activities may code for error signals.	Semantic Scholar

In the direct visual servoing methods such as photometric framework, the images as a whole are used to define a control law.	Semantic Scholar
This can be opposed to the classical visual servoing approaches that relies on geometric features and where image processing algorithms that extract and track visual features are necessary.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a generic framework to consider histogram as a visual feature.	Semantic Scholar
A histogram is an estimate of the probability distribution of a variable (for example the probability of occurrence in an intensity, color, or gradient orientation in an image).	Semantic Scholar
We show that the framework we proposed applies, but is not limited to, a wide set of histograms and allows the definition of efficient control laws.	Semantic Scholar
Statistical comparisons are presented from simulation results and real robots experiments including navigation tasks are also provided.	Semantic Scholar
The Mizar system is one of the pioneering systems aimed at supporting mathematical proof development on a computer that have laid the groundwork for and eventually have evolved into modern interactive proof assistants.	Semantic Scholar
We claim that an important milestone in the development of these systems was the creation of organized libraries accumulating all previously available formalized knowledge in such a way that new works could effectively re-use all previously collected notions.	Semantic Scholar
In the case of Mizar, the turning point of its development was the decision to start building the Mizar Mathematical Library as a centrally-managed knowledge base maintained together with the formalization language and the verification system.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we show the process of forming this library, the evolution of its design principles, and also present some data showing its current use with the modern version of the Mizar proof checker, but also as a rich corpus of semantically linked mathematical data in various areas including web-based and natural language proof presentation, maths education, and machine learning based automated theorem proving.

This paper presents a method for measuring the semantic similarity between concepts in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) such as WordNet and DBpedia.	Semantic Scholar
Previous work on semantic similarity methods have focused on either the structure of the semantic network between concepts (e.g., path length and depth), or only on the Information Content (IC) of concepts.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a semantic similarity method, namely wpath, to combine these two approaches, using IC to weight the shortest path length between concepts.	Semantic Scholar
Conventional corpus-based IC is computed from the distributions of concepts over textual corpus, which is required to prepare a domain corpus containing annotated concepts and has high computational cost.	Semantic Scholar
As instances are already extracted from textual corpus and annotated by concepts in KGs, graph-based IC is proposed to compute IC based on the distributions of concepts over instances.	Semantic Scholar
Through experiments performed on well known word similarity datasets, we show that the wpath semantic similarity method has produced a statistically significant improvement over other semantic similarity methods.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, in a real category classification evaluation, the wpath method has shown the best performance in terms of accuracy and F score.	Semantic Scholar
Seizure prediction has attracted growing attention as one of the most challenging predictive data analysis efforts to improve the life of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and tonic seizures.	Semantic Scholar
Many outstanding studies have reported great results in providing sensible indirect (warning systems) or direct (interactive neural stimulation) control over refractory seizures, some of which achieved high performance.	Semantic Scholar
However, to achieve high sensitivity and a low false prediction rate, many of these studies relied on handcraft feature extraction and/or tailored feature extraction, which is performed for each patient independently.	Semantic Scholar
This approach, however, is not generalizable, and requires significant modifications for each new patient within a new dataset.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we apply convolutional neural networks to different intracranial and scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets and propose a generalized retrospective and patient-specific seizure prediction method.	Semantic Scholar
We use the short-time Fourier transform on 30-s EEG windows to extract information in both the frequency domain and the time domain.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm automatically generates optimized features for each patient to best classify preictal and interictal segments.	Semantic Scholar
The method can be applied to any other patient from any dataset without the need for manual feature extraction.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach achieves sensitivity of 81.4%, 81.2%, and 75% and a false prediction rate of 0.06/h, 0.16/h, and 0.21/h on the Freiburg Hospital intracranial EEG dataset, the Boston Children's Hospital-MIT scalp EEG dataset, and the American Epilepsy Society Seizure Prediction Challenge dataset, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
Our prediction method is also statistically better than an unspecific random predictor for most of the patients in all three datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Model-free reinforcement learning and nonlinear model predictive control are two different approaches for controlling a dynamic system in an optimal way according to a prescribed cost function.	Semantic Scholar
Reinforcement learning acquires a control policy through exploratory interaction with the system, while nonlinear model predictive control exploits an explicitly given mathematical model of the system.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we provide a comprehensive comparison of the performance of reinforcement learning and nonlinear model predictive control for an ideal system as well as for a system with parametric and structural uncertainties.	Semantic Scholar
The comparison is based on two different criteria, namely the similarity of trajectories and the resulting rewards.	Semantic Scholar
The evaluation of both methods is performed on a standard benchmark problem: a cart-pendulum swing-up and balance task.	Semantic Scholar
We first find suitable mathematical formulations and discuss the effect of the differences in the problem formulations.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we investigate the robustness of reinforcement learning and nonlinear model predictive control against uncertainties.	Semantic Scholar
The results demonstrate that nonlinear model predictive control has advantages over reinforcement learning if uncertainties can be eliminated through identification of the system parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Otherwise, there exists a break-even point after which model-free reinforcement learning performs better than nonlinear model predictive control with an inaccurate model.	Semantic Scholar
These findings suggest that benefits can be obtained by combining these methods for real systems being subject to such uncertainties.	Semantic Scholar
In the future, we plan to develop a hybrid controller and evaluate its performance on a real seven-degree-of-freedom walking robot.	Semantic Scholar

The problem of global dissipativity analysis for quaternion-valued neural networks (QVNNs) with time-varying delays is firstly investigated in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
The QVNN is studied as a single entirety without any decomposition.	Semantic Scholar
Several algebraic conditions ensuring the global dissipativity and globally exponential dissipativity for QVNNs are derived by employing Lyapunov theory and some analytic techniques.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the positive invariant sets, globally attractive sets and globally exponentially attractive sets are figured out as well.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the effectiveness is notarized by deducing two simulation examples.	Semantic Scholar

The well-known “fat finger” issue limits the interaction performance of trajectory-based finger gestures.	Semantic Scholar
To alleviate this issue, this work focuses on the possibility of using additional continuous auditory feedback to assist trajectory-based finger gestures.	Semantic Scholar
First, the experiment validated that, with the visual feedback only, the bare fingertip led to more errors in drawing of intersectional points, endpoints of closed gestures, and gestural length and shape variability compared to when the finger-attached pen was used.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we designed different types of auditory feedback (discrete beep, static, gradual) to provide additional information on the spatial relationship between finger-contact point and the endpoints or intersections of predefined gestures.	Semantic Scholar
An experiment that evaluates the effects of individual or combination of designed auditory feedback on trajectory-based finger gestures was conducted.	Semantic Scholar
These results show a few differences between them.	Semantic Scholar
However, a combination of gradual (amplitude and frequency) continuous sound and beep reached the highest drawing accuracy for trajectory-based finger gestures, which is similar to that of a finger-attached pen.	Semantic Scholar
This research offers insights and implications for the future design of continuous auditory feedback on small touchscreens.	Semantic Scholar
We present a three-dimensional (3-D)-printable thermoactive scale jamming interface as a new way to control a continuum manipulator dexterity by taking inspiration from the helical arrangement of fish scales.	Semantic Scholar
A highly articulated helical interface is 3-D-printed with thermoactive functionally graded joints using a conventional 3-D printing device that utilizes UV curable acrylic plastic and hydroxylated wax as the primary and supporting material.	Semantic Scholar
The joint compliance is controlled by regulating wax temperature in phase transition.	Semantic Scholar
Empirical feed-forward control relations are identified through comprehensive study of the wax melting profile and actuation scenarios for different shaft designs to achieve desirable repeatability and response time.	Semantic Scholar
A decentralized control approach is employed by relating the mathematical terms of the Cosserat beam method to their morphological counterparts in which the manipulator local anisotropic stiffness is controlled based on the local stress and strain information.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, a minimalistic central controller is designed in which the joints’ thermomechanical states are observed using a morphological observer, an external fully monitored replica of the observed system with the same inputs.	Semantic Scholar
Preliminary results for passive shape adaptation, geometrical disturbance rejection, and task space anisotropic stiffness control are reported by integrating the interface on a continuum manipulator.	Semantic Scholar
The query logs from an on-line map query system provide rich cues to understand the behaviors of human crowds.	Semantic Scholar
With the growing ability of collecting large scale query logs, the query suggestion has been a topic of recent interest.	Semantic Scholar
In general, query suggestion aims at recommending a list of relevant queries w.r.t.	Semantic Scholar
users’ inputs via an appropriate learning of crowds’ query logs.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we are particularly interested in map query suggestions (e.g., the predictions of location-related queries) and propose a novel model Hierarchical Contextual Attention Recurrent Neural Network (HCAR-NN) for map query suggestion in an encoding-decoding manner.	Semantic Scholar
Given crowds map query logs, our proposed HCAR-NN not only learns the local temporal correlation among map queries in a query session (e.g., queries in a short-term interval are relevant to accomplish a search mission), but also captures the global longer range contextual dependencies among map query sessions in query logs (e.g., how a sequence of queries within a short-term interval has an influence on another sequence of queries).	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our approach over millions of queries from a commercial search engine (i.e., Baidu Map).	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that the proposed approach provides significant performance improvements over the competitive existing methods in terms of classical metrics (i.e., Recall@K and MRR) as well as the prediction of crowds’ search missions.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate how 3D head tracking and pose estimation can be effectively and efficiently achieved from noisy RGB-D sequences.	Semantic Scholar
Our proposal leverages on a random forest framework, designed to regress the 3D head pose at every frame in a temporal tracking manner.	Semantic Scholar
One peculiarity of the algorithm is that it exploits together (1) a generic training dataset of 3D head models, which is learned once offline; and, (2) an online refinement with subject-specific 3D data, which aims for the tracker to withstand slight facial deformations and to adapt its forest to the specific characteristics of an individual subject.	Semantic Scholar
The combination of these works allows our algorithm to be robust even under extreme poses, where the user’s face is no longer visible on the image.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we also propose another solution that utilizes a multi-camera system such that the data simultaneously acquired from multiple RGB-D sensors helps the tracker to handle challenging conditions that affect a subset of the cameras.	Semantic Scholar
Notably, the proposed multi-camera frameworks yields a real-time performance of approximately 8 ms per frame given six cameras and one CPU core, and scales up linearly to 30 fps with 25 cameras.	Semantic Scholar
Books, as a representative of lengthy documents, convey rich semantics.	Semantic Scholar
Traditional document modeling methods, such as bag-of-words models, have difficulty capturing such rich semantics when only considering term-frequency features.	Semantic Scholar
In order to explore term spatial distributions over a book, a tree-structured book representation is investigated in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, an efficient learning framework, Tree2Vector, is introduced for mapping tree-structured book data into vectorial space.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we present two types of locality reconstruction (LR) models: Euclidean-type and cosine-type, during the transformation process of tree structures into vectorial representations.	Semantic Scholar
The LR is used for modeling the reconstruction process, in which each parent node in a tree is supposed to be reconstructed by its child nodes.	Semantic Scholar
The prominent advantage of this Tree2Vector framework is that it solely utilizes the local information within a single book tree.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, extensive experimental results demonstrate that Tree2Vector is able to deliver comparable or better performance in comparison to methods that consider the information of all trees in a database globally.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results also suggest that cosine-type LR consistently performs better than Euclidean-type LR in applications of book and author recommendations.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a collaborative multi-domain sentiment classification approach to train sentiment classifiers for multiple domains simultaneously.	Semantic Scholar
In our approach, the sentiment information in different domains is shared to train more accurate and robust sentiment classifiers for each domain when labeled data is scarce.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we decompose the sentiment classifier of each domain into two components, a global one and a domain-specific one.	Semantic Scholar
The global model can capture the general sentiment knowledge and is shared by various domains.	Semantic Scholar
The domain-specific model can capture the specific sentiment expressions in each domain.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we extract domain-specific sentiment knowledge from both labeled and unlabeled samples in each domain and use it to enhance the learning of domain-specific sentiment classifiers.	Semantic Scholar
Besides, we incorporate the similarities between domains into our approach as regularization over the domain-specific sentiment classifiers to encourage the sharing of sentiment information between similar domains.	Semantic Scholar
Two kinds of domain similarity measures are explored, one based on textual content and the other one based on sentiment expressions.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we introduce two efficient algorithms to solve the model of our approach.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our approach can effectively improve the performance of multi-domain sentiment classification and significantly outperform baseline methods.	Semantic Scholar
We consider a decision-making problem where the environment varies both in space and time.	Semantic Scholar
Such problems arise naturally when considering, e.g., the navigation of an underwater robot amidst ocean currents or the navigation of an aerial vehicle in wind.	Semantic Scholar
To model such spatiotemporal variation, we extend the standard Markov decision process (MDP) to a new framework called the time-varying Markov decision process (TVMDP).	Semantic Scholar
The TVMDP has a time-varying state transition model and transforms the standard MDP that considers only immediate and static  uncertainty descriptions of state transitions, to a framework that is able to adapt to future time-varying transition dynamics over some horizon.	Semantic Scholar
We show how to solve a TVMDP via a redesign of the MDP value propagation mechanisms by incorporating the introduced dynamics along the temporal dimension.	Semantic Scholar
We validate our framework in a marine robotics navigation setting using spatiotemporal ocean data and show that it outperforms prior efforts.	Semantic Scholar

Spatial event forecasting from social media is potentially extremely useful but suffers from critical challenges, such as the dynamic patterns of features (keywords) and geographic heterogeneity (e.g., spatial correlations, imbalanced samples, and different populations in different locations).	Semantic Scholar
Most existing approaches (e.g., LASSO regression, dynamic query expansion, and burst detection) address some, but not all, of these challenges.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework that aims to concurrently address all the challenges involved.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, given a collection of locations (e.g., cities), forecasting models are built for all the locations simultaneously by extracting and utilizing appropriate shared information that effectively increases the sample size for each location, thus improving the forecasting performance.	Semantic Scholar
The new model combines both static features derived from a predefined vocabulary by domain experts and dynamic features generated from dynamic query expansion in a multi-task feature learning framework.	Semantic Scholar
Different strategies to balance homogeneity and diversity between static and dynamic terms are also investigated.	Semantic Scholar
And, efficient algorithms based on Iterative Group Hard Thresholding are developed to achieve efficient and effective model training and prediction.	Semantic Scholar

Robots that can assist in the activities of daily living, such as dressing, may support older adults, addressing the needs of an aging population in the face of a growing shortage of care professionals.	Semantic Scholar
Using depth cameras during robot-assisted dressing can lead to occlusions and loss of user tracking, which may result in unsafe trajectory planning or prevent the planning task proceeding altogether.	Semantic Scholar
For the dressing task of putting on a jacket, which is addressed in this letter, tracking of the arm is lost when the user's hand enters the jacket, which may lead to unsafe situations for the user and a poor interaction experience.	Semantic Scholar
Using motion tracking data, free from occlusions, gathered from a human–human interaction study on an assisted dressing task, recurrent neural network models were built to predict the elbow position of a single arm based on other features of the user pose.	Semantic Scholar
The best features for predicting the elbow position were explored by using regression trees indicating the hips and shoulder as possible predictors.	Semantic Scholar
Engineered features were also created based on observations of real dressing scenarios and their effectiveness explored.	Semantic Scholar
Comparison between position and orientation-based datasets was also included in this study.	Semantic Scholar
A 12-fold cross-validation was performed for each feature set and repeated 20 times to improve statistical power.	Semantic Scholar
Using position-based data, the elbow position could be predicted with a 4.1 cm error but adding engineered features reduced the error to 2.4 cm.	Semantic Scholar
Adding orientation information to the data did not improve the accuracy and aggregating univariate response models failed to make significant improvements.	Semantic Scholar
The model was evaluated on Kinect data for a robot dressing task and although not without issues, demonstrates potential for this application.	Semantic Scholar
Although this has been demonstrated for jacket dressing, the technique could be applied to a number of different situations during occluded tracking.	Semantic Scholar
Exoskeletons are a promising technology that enables individuals with mobility limitations to walk again.	Semantic Scholar

While most exoskeletons power only hip and knee flexion, Team Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC) presents a new exoskeleton, Mina v2, which includes a powered ankle dorsi/plantar flexion (Figure 1).	Semantic Scholar
As our entry to the 2016 Cybathlon Powered Exoskeleton Competition, Mina v2's performance allowed us to explore the effectiveness of its powered ankle compared to other powered exoskeletons for pilots with paraplegia.	Semantic Scholar
We designed our gaits to incorporate powered ankle plantar flexion to help improve mobility, which allowed our pilot to navigate the given Cybathlon tasks quickly, including those that required ascending movements, and reliably achieve average, conservative walking speeds of 1.04 km/h (0.29 m/s).

Probabilistic 3D plane and line fitting solutions are used to model the uncertainties of the feature parameters and pose is estimated by combining the three types of primitives based on their uncertainties.	Semantic Scholar
Performance evaluation on RGB-D sequences collected in this work and two public RGB-D datasets: TUM and ICL-NUIM show the benefit of using the proposed depth fusion framework and combining the three feature-types, particularly in scenes with low-textured surfaces, dynamic objects and missing depth measurements.

Yet, using numerical and software engineering allows for running the nonlinear Optimal Control solver at rates up to 190 Hz on a quadruped for a time horizon of half a second.	Semantic Scholar
This outperforms the state-of-the-art by at least one order of magnitude.	Semantic Scholar
Hardware experiments in the form of periodic and nonperiodic tasks are applied to two quadrupeds with different actuation systems.	Semantic Scholar

Delay-independent stability criteria for the two types of systems are established by using the maximum modulus principle and the spectral radii of matrices.	Semantic Scholar

Influence maximization is a recent but well-studied problem which helps identify a small set of users that are most likely to “influence” the maximum number of users in a social network.	Semantic Scholar
The problem has attracted a lot of attention as it provides a way to improve marketing, branding, and product adoption.	Semantic Scholar
However, existing studies rarely consider the physical locations of the users, but location is an important factor in targeted marketing.	Semantic Scholar

Experimental results validate the performance of the proposed algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
The efficiency of the probabilistic neural network (PNN) is very sensitive to the cardinality of a considered input data set.	Semantic Scholar
It results from the design of the network's pattern layer.	Semantic Scholar
In this layer, the neurons perform an activation on all input records.	Semantic Scholar
This makes the PNN architecture complex, especially for big data classification tasks.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a new algorithm for the structure reduction of the PNN is put forward.	Semantic Scholar
The solution relies on performing a fuzzy c-means data clustering and selecting PNN's pattern neurons on the basis of the obtained centroids.	Semantic Scholar
Then, to activate the pattern neurons, the algorithm chooses input vectors for which the highest values of the membership coefficients are determined.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach is applied to the classification tasks of repository data sets.	Semantic Scholar
PNN is trained by three different classification procedures: conjugate gradients, reinforcement learning and the plugin method.	Semantic Scholar

Given two object sets Q and O, a metric similarity join finds similar object pairs according to a certain criterion.	Semantic Scholar
This operation has a wide variety of applications in data cleaning and data mining, to name but a few.	Semantic Scholar

In this paper, we adopt a popular distributed framework, namely, MapReduce, to support scalable metric similarity joins.	Semantic Scholar
To ensure the load balancing, we present two sampling based partition methods.	Semantic Scholar
One utilizes the pivot and the space-filling curve mappings to cluster the data into one-dimensional space, and then selects high quality centroids to enable equal-sized partitions.	Semantic Scholar
The other uses the KD-tree partitioning technique to equally divide the data after the pivot mapping.	Semantic Scholar
To avoid unnecessary object pair evaluation, we propose a framework that maps the two involved object sets in order, where the range-object filtering, the double-pivot filtering, the pivot filtering, and the plane sweeping techniques are utilized for pruning.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments with both real and synthetic data sets demonstrate that our solutions outperform significantly existing state-of-the-art competitors.	Semantic Scholar
Discriminant locality preserving projections (DLPP), which has shown good performances in pattern recognition, is a feature extraction algorithm based on manifold learning.	Semantic Scholar
However, DLPP suffers from the well-known small sample size (SSS) problem, where the number of samples is less than the dimension of samples.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a novel matrix exponential based discriminant locality preserving projections (MEDLPP).	Semantic Scholar
The proposed MEDLPP method can address the SSS problem elegantly since the matrix exponential of a symmetric matrix is always positive definite.	Semantic Scholar
Nevertheless, the computational complexity of MEDLPP is high since it needs to solve a large matrix exponential eigenproblem.	Semantic Scholar
Then, in this paper, we also present an efficient algorithm for solving MEDLPP.	Semantic Scholar
Besides, the main idea for solving MEDLPP efficiently is also generalized to other matrix exponential based methods.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results on some data sets demonstrate the proposed algorithm outperforms many state-of-the-art discriminant analysis methods.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a two-layer control architecture for bilateral teleoperation with communication delays.	Semantic Scholar
The controller is structured with an (inner) performance layer and an (outer) passivity layer.	Semantic Scholar
In the performance layer, any traditional controller for bilateral teleoperation can be implemented.	Semantic Scholar
The passivity layer guarantees that, from the operator and environment perspective, the overall teleoperator is passive: The amount of energy that can be extracted from the teleoperator is bounded from below and the rate of increase of the stored energy in the teleoperator is bounded by (twice) the environment and operator supplied power.	Semantic Scholar
Passivity is ensured by modulating the performance layer outputs and by injecting a variable amount of damping via an energy-based logic that follows the innovative principle of energy duplication and takes into account the detrimental effects of time delays.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to the traditional teleoperation approach, in which the master and slave controllers implement an as-stiff-as-possible coupling between the master and slave devices, our scheme is specifically designed for direct force-reflecting bilateral teleoperation: The slave controller mimics the operator action, whereas the master controller reflects the slave-environment interaction.	Semantic Scholar
We illustrate the performance of the two-layer approach in a challenging experiment with a round-trip communication delay of 300 ms while making and breaking contact with a stiff aluminum environment.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we also compare our controller with the state of the art.	Semantic Scholar

It is essential for a robot to be able to detect revisits or loop closures for long-term visual navigation.	Semantic Scholar
A key insight explored in this work is that the loop-closing event inherently occurs sparsely, i.e., the image currently being taken matches with only a small subset (if any) of previous images.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this observation, we formulate the problem of loop-closure detection as a sparse, convex `1-minimization problem.	Semantic Scholar
By leveraging fast convex optimization techniques, we are able to efficiently find loop closures, thus enabling real-time robot navigation.	Semantic Scholar
This novel formulation requires no offline dictionary learning, as required by most existing approaches, and thus allows online incremental operation.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach ensures a unique hypothesis by choosing only a single globally optimal match when making a loop-closure decision.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the proposed formulation enjoys a flexible representation with no restriction imposed on how images should be represented, while requiring only that the representations are “close” to each other when the corresponding images are visually similar.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed algorithm is validated extensively using real-world datasets.	Semantic Scholar
We propose to incorporate within bundle adjustment (BA) a new type of constraint that uses feature scale information, leveraging the scale invariance property of typical image feature detectors (e.g., SIFT).	Semantic Scholar
While feature scales play an important role in image matching, they have not been utilized thus far for estimation purposes in a BA framework.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach exploits the already-available feature scale information and uses it to enhance the accuracy of BA, especially along the optical axis of the camera in a monocular setup.	Semantic Scholar
Importantly, the mentioned feature scale constraints can be formulated on a frame to frame basis and do not require loop closures.	Semantic Scholar
We study our approach in synthetic environments and the real-imagery KITTI dataset, demonstrating significant improvement in positioning error.	Semantic Scholar
Representation learning plays an important role for building effective deep neural network models.	Semantic Scholar
Deep generative probabilistic models have shown to be efficient in the data representation learning task which is usually carried out in an unsupervised fashion.	Semantic Scholar
Throughout the past decade, there has been almost exclusive focus on the learning algorithms to improve representation capability of the generative models.	Semantic Scholar
However, effective data representation requires improvement in both learning algorithm and architecture of the generative models.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, improvement to the neural architecture is critical for improved data representation capability of deep generative models.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the prevailing class of deep generative models such as deep belief network (DBN), deep Boltzman machine (DBM) and deep sigmoid belief network (DSBN) are inherently unidirectional and lack recurrent connections ubiquitous in the biological neuronal structures.	Semantic Scholar
Introduction of recurrent connections may offer further improvement in data representation learning performance to the deep generative models.	Semantic Scholar
Consequently, for the first time in literature, this work proposes a deep recurrent generative model known as deep simultaneous recurrent belief network (D-SRBN) to efficiently learn representations from unlabeled data.	Semantic Scholar
Experimentation on four benchmark datasets: MNIST, Caltech 101 Silhouettes, OCR letters and Omniglot show that the proposed D-SRBN model achieves superior representation learning performance while utilizing less computing resources when compared to the four state-of-the-art generative models such as deep belief network (DBN), DBM, DSBN and VAE (variational auto-encoder).	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we address the trajectory tracking problem of the end-effector of a single link flexible arm in which the gravity forces and the joint friction forces are taken into account.	Semantic Scholar
As an overall approach, a double loop cascade control is used to deal with the joint friction: in its inner loop a two-degree-of-freedom controller is responsible for the joint position in the presence of Coulomb friction disturbances, while in its outer loop an input-state feedback linearization-based controller is implemented to suppress the vibrations and track an end-effector trajectory.	Semantic Scholar
To highlight the benefits of the proposed controller in presence of joint friction, the controller was compared with other approaches based on feedback linearization reported in the literature, which considered only a single loop.	Semantic Scholar
The results of this comparison showed that our approach provides superior performance in terms of settling time, maximum overshoot and residual vibrations.	Semantic Scholar
The design of the controller presented relies on a non-linear single-lumped mass dynamic model that describes the dynamics of a single link arm with only one significant vibrational mode.	Semantic Scholar
The hypothesis of a single lumped mass model could be considered inaccurate given the distributed nature of the link mass, especially in situations in which the link mass is comparable to the payload mass held by the robot.	Semantic Scholar
However, for the parameters of our physical platform two studies are presented to demonstrate that the single lumped mass model is a Preprint submitted to Journal of Robotics and Autonomous Systems October 19, 2016 proper description of the system even in situations in which the link mass is up twice bigger than the payload mass.

The results of the paper are demonstrated with co-simulations with Matlab/Simulink and MSC ADAMS, and experimental validation.	Semantic Scholar
This paper considers the problem of localizing actions in videos as sequences of bounding boxes.	Semantic Scholar
The objective is to generate action proposals that are likely to include the action of interest, ideally achieving high recall with few proposals.	Semantic Scholar
Our contributions are threefold.	Semantic Scholar
First, inspired by selective search for object proposals, we introduce an approach to generate action proposals from spatiotemporal super-voxels in an unsupervised manner, we call them Tubelets.	Semantic Scholar
Second, along with the static features from individual frames our approach advantageously exploits motion.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce independent motion evidence as a feature to characterize how the action deviates from the background and explicitly incorporate such motion information in various stages of the proposal generation.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we introduce spatiotemporal refinement of Tubelets, for more precise localization of actions, and pruning to keep the number of Tubelets limited.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the suitability of our approach by extensive experiments for action proposal quality and action localization on three public datasets: UCF Sports, MSR-II and UCF101.	Semantic Scholar
For action proposal quality, our unsupervised proposals beat all other existing approaches on the three datasets.	Semantic Scholar
For action localization, we show top performance on both the trimmed videos of UCF Sports and UCF101 as well as the untrimmed videos of MSR-II.	Semantic Scholar

We study the nonlinear observability of a system's states in view of how well they are observable and what control inputs would improve the convergence of their estimates.	Semantic Scholar
We use these insights to develop an observability-aware trajectory-optimization framework for nonlinear systems that produces trajectories well suited for self-calibration.	Semantic Scholar
Our method reasons about the quality of observability while respecting system dynamics and motion constraints to yield the optimal trajectory for rapid convergence of the self-calibration states (or other user-chosen states).	Semantic Scholar
Self-calibration trials with a real and a simulated quadrotor provide compelling evidence that the proposed method is both faster and more accurate compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.	Semantic Scholar
A class of abstract aerial robotic systems is introduced, the laterally bounded force vehicles, in which most of the control authority is expressed along a principal thrust direction, while along the lateral directions a (smaller and possibly null) force may be exploited to achieve full-pose tracking.	Semantic Scholar
This class approximates platforms endowed with noncollinear rotors that can modify the orientation of the total thrust in a body frame.	Semantic Scholar
If made possible by the force constraints, the proposed SE(3)-based control strategy achieves the independent tracking of position-plus-orientation trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
The method, which is proven using a Lyapunov technique, deals seamlessly with both underactuated  and fully actuated platforms, and guarantees at least the position tracking in the case of an unfeasible full-pose reference trajectory.	Semantic Scholar
Several experimental tests are presented that clearly show the approach practicability and the sharp improvement with respect to state of the art.	Semantic Scholar
Surprise expressions often occur in dialogue interactions, and they are often accompanied by verbal interjectional utterances.	Semantic Scholar
We are dealing with the challenge of generating natural human-like motions during speech in android robots that have a highly human-like appearance.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we focus on the analysis and motion generation of vocalized surprise expression.	Semantic Scholar
We first analyze facial, head, and body motions during vocalized surprise appearing in human–human dialogue interactions.	Semantic Scholar
Analysis results indicate differences in the motion types for different types of surprise expression as well as different degrees of surprise expression.	Semantic Scholar
Consequently, we propose motion-generation methods based on the analysis results and evaluate the different modalities (eyebrows/eyelids, head, and body torso) and different motion control levels for the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
This work is carried out through subjective experiments.	Semantic Scholar
Evaluation results indicate the importance of each modality in the perception of surprise degree, naturalness, and the spontaneous versus intentional expression of surprise.	Semantic Scholar
Frequent subgraph mining is a core graph operation used in many domains, such as graph data management and knowledge exploration, bioinformatics, and security.	Semantic Scholar
Most existing techniques target static graphs.	Semantic Scholar
However, modern applications, such as social networks, utilize large evolving graphs.	Semantic Scholar
Mining these graphs using existing techniques is infeasible, due to the high computational cost.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose IncGM+, a fast incremental approach for continuous frequent subgraph mining on a single large evolving graph.	Semantic Scholar
We adapt the notion of “fringe” to the graph context, that is the set of subgraphs on the border between frequent and infrequent subgraphs.	Semantic Scholar
IncGM+ maintains fringe subgraphs and exploits them to prune the search space.	Semantic Scholar
To boost the efficiency, we propose an efficient index structure to maintain selected embeddings with minimal memory overhead.	Semantic Scholar
These embeddings are utilized to avoid redundant expensive subgraph isomorphism operations.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the proposed system supports batch updates.	Semantic Scholar
Using large real-world graphs, we experimentally verify that IncGM+ outperforms existing methods by up to three orders of magnitude, scales to much larger graphs and consumes less memory.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a novel multimodal training platform integrated with hand-over-hand (HOH) haptic guidance for dual-console surgical robotic systems such as the da Vinci Si system.	Semantic Scholar
The expert-in-the-loop (EIL) framework incorporates a fuzzy interface system in order to provide a trainee with adaptive authority over the procedure as well as hand-over-hand haptic guidance adjusted in real time based on the proficiency level of the trainee.	Semantic Scholar
The EIL expertise-oriented framework enables performance of a surgical procedure by an expert surgeon on a patient, while simultaneously providing a trainee at any stage of the motor-skills development with multimodal training without jeopardizing patient safety.	Semantic Scholar
Closed-loop stability of the system is investigated using the circle criterion and it is shown that the proposed architecture is unconditionally stable.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental evaluations are presented in support of the proposed platform through the implementation of a dual-console surgical setup consisting of the classic da Vinci surgical system (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and the dV-Trainer master console (Mimic Technology, Inc., Seattle, WA, USA).

To the best of our knowledge, the implemented setup is the first research platform for dual-console studies involving the classic da Vinci surgical system.	Semantic Scholar

Quantitative analysis of the plantar pressure distribution during dynamic tasks can facilitate diagnosis of foot and ankle dysfunctions and prevent potential injuries by providing detailed information about weight bearing and weight shifting patterns.	Semantic Scholar
Traditional laboratory measurements are currently limited by high operating costs and lack of portability.	Semantic Scholar
The use of instrumented insoles capable of capturing kinematic and kinetic gait parameters as subjects perform out-of-the-lab dynamic activities is a promising approach to overcome these limitations.	Semantic Scholar
This letter introduces <italic>SportSole</italic>, a fully portable system that can measure spatiotemporal gait parameters and center of pressure (CoP) trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
Wearing the <italic>SportSole</italic>, nine able-bodied subjects completed a walking session followed by a running session, each consisting of 10 full laps along a 16-meter straight-line path.	Semantic Scholar
Accuracy and precision of CoP trajectories and kinematic parameters were assessed using an electronic walkway as the reference system.	Semantic Scholar

Fast nearest neighbor search is becoming more and more crucial given the advent of large-scale data in many computer vision applications.	Semantic Scholar
Hashing approaches provide both fast search mechanisms and compact index structures to address this critical need.	Semantic Scholar
In image retrieval problems where labeled training data is available, supervised hashing methods prevail over unsupervised methods.	Semantic Scholar
Most state-of-the-art supervised hashing approaches employ batch-learners.	Semantic Scholar
Unfortunately, batch-learning strategies may be inefficient when confronted with large datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, with batch-learners, it is unclear how to adapt the hash functions as the dataset continues to grow and new variations appear over time.	Semantic Scholar
To handle these issues, we propose OSH: an Online Supervised Hashing technique that is based on Error Correcting Output Codes.	Semantic Scholar
We consider a stochastic setting where the data arrives sequentially and our method learns and adapts its hashing functions in a discriminative manner.	Semantic Scholar
Our method makes no assumption about the number of possible class labels, and accommodates new classes as they are presented in the incoming data stream.	Semantic Scholar
In experiments with three image retrieval benchmarks, our method yields state-of-theart retrieval performance as measured in Mean Average Precision, while also being orders-of-magnitude faster than competing batch methods for supervised hashing.	Semantic Scholar
Also, our method significantly outperforms recently introduced online hashing solutions.	Semantic Scholar

Instead of generic and commonly used representations trained on the ImageNet classification task, our approach employs a combination of networks trained for specialized tasks such as scene recognition, person activity classification, and attribute prediction.	Semantic Scholar
We also present a method for localizing phrases from candidate answers in order to provide spatial support for feature extraction.	Semantic Scholar
We map each of these features, together with candidate answers, to a joint embedding space through normalized canonical correlation analysis (nCCA).	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we solve an optimization problem to learn to combine scores from nCCA models trained on multiple cues to select the best answer.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experimental results show a significant improvement over the previous state of the art and confirm that answering questions from a wide range of types benefits from examining a variety of image cues and carefully choosing the spatial support for feature extraction.	Semantic Scholar

This work takes important steps towards solving the following problem of current interest: Assuming that each individual in a population can be modeled by a single frontal RGBD face image, is it possible to carry out face recognition for such a population using multiple 2D images captured from arbitrary viewpoints?	Semantic Scholar
Although the general problem as stated above is extremely challenging, it encompasses subproblems that can be addressed today.	Semantic Scholar
The subproblems addressed in this work relate to: (1) Generating a large set of viewpoint dependent face images from a single RGBD frontal image for each individual; (2) using hierarchical approaches based on view-partitioned subspaces to represent the training data; and (3) based on these hierarchical approaches, using a weighted voting algorithm to integrate the evidence collected from multiple images of the same face as recorded from different viewpoints.

We evaluate our methods on three datasets: a dataset of 10 people that we created and two publicly available datasets which include a total of 48 people.	Semantic Scholar
In addition to providing important insights into the nature of this problem, our results show that we are able to successfully recognize faces with accuracies of 95% or higher, outperforming existing state-of-the-art face recognition approaches based on deep convolutional	Semantic Scholar
To resolve one of uncertainty features, randomness, in ontologies, this paper shows how to characterize uncertainty of concepts from a statistical viewpoint.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, with a focus on indirect entities, which are computed from direct entities through mathematical models, the uncertainties propagated from those direct entities are important and should be quantified.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, a novel algorithm, named Stochastic Reduced Order Model (SROM), is presented to be applied to quantify the ontological uncertainty propagation in presence of multiple input entities.	Semantic Scholar
This SROM-based method could approximate the statistics of indirect entities accurately and efficiently by using a very small amount of samples of input entities.	Semantic Scholar
The computational cost is considerably reduced while guaranteeing a reasonable degree of accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the predicted statistics of output entities could be regarded as high-level information and be beneficial for other ontological operations, such as ontology filtering and ontology reasoning.	Semantic Scholar
The implementation of the SROM algorithm is non-intrusive to the mathematical model; therefore, this algorithm could be applicable to quantify uncertainty in ontologies with any mathematical relationships.	Semantic Scholar
Integrating tactile sensors into robotic applications is still a challenge because of sensor interconnection and various form factors.	Semantic Scholar
Newly developed magnetic synapse sensors have high sensitivity and remote sensing capability, but integration with a robotic finger is an issue because of the air-transmitting tubes that need to be connected from the sensor to the remotely located base unit.	Semantic Scholar
This study proposes an integrated design of a multijoint robotic finger with magnetic synapse sensors inspired by the human's joint structure and synapse system.	Semantic Scholar
The joint unit inspired by human's finger joints for the usage of the magnetic synapse sensors can easily has hollow channels and insert air-transmitting tubes through a rotating joint compared to the traditional pin joint.	Semantic Scholar
The rolling contact joint also minimizes the length variation of the tube when the joint rotates because the center of rotation changes.	Semantic Scholar
Modularized sensor units capable of changing the sensor sensitivity and sensing range have been developed and applied to the remote tactile sensing system.	Semantic Scholar
A three-finger gripper with three joints per finger with an integrated three-tactile sensor array was prototyped to explore the feasibility of the units.	Semantic Scholar
The sensor sensitivity was 0.016 mV/kPa and the sensing range was 350 kPa.	Semantic Scholar
The robotic fingers integrated with a high-sensitivity sensor array can grasp objects with various shapes and compliance (i.e., artificial flowers, paper cups, and wine glasses) without damaging the objects using tactile feedback.	Semantic Scholar
Bag of visual words (BoVW) models are widely utilized in image/ video representation and recognition.	Semantic Scholar
The cornerstone of these models is the encoding stage, in which local features are decomposed over a codebook in order to obtain a representation of features.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a new encoding algorithm by jointly encoding the set of local descriptors of each sample and considering the locality structure of descriptors.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method takes advantages of locality coding such as its stability and robustness to noise in descriptors, as well as the strengths of the group coding strategy by taking into account the potential relation among descriptors of a sample.	Semantic Scholar
To efficiently implement our proposed method, we consider the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework, which results in quadratic complexity in the problem size.	Semantic Scholar
The method is employed for a challenging classification problem: action recognition by depth cameras.	Semantic Scholar

Fully-automatic facial expression recognition (FER) is a key component of human behavior analysis.	Semantic Scholar
Performing FER from still images is a challenging task as it involves handling large interpersonal morphological differences, and as partial occlusions can occasionally happen.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, labelling expressions is a time-consuming process that is prone to subjectivity, thus the variability may not be fully covered by the training data.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we propose to train random forests upon spatially-constrained random local subspaces of the face.	Semantic Scholar
The output local predictions form a categorical expression-driven high-level representation that we call local expression predictions (LEPs).	Semantic Scholar
LEPs can be combined to describe categorical facial expressions as well as action units (AUs).	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, LEPs can be weighted by confidence scores provided by an autoencoder network.	Semantic Scholar
Such network is trained to locally capture the manifold of the non-occluded training data in a hierarchical way.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments show that the proposed LEP representation yields high descriptive power for categorical expressions and AU occurrence prediction, and leads to interesting perspectives towards the design of occlusion-robust and confidence-aware FER systems.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we propose a robust chemical plume tracing (CPT) algorithm for various environments.	Semantic Scholar
We developed this algorithm based on the behavior of insects that have CPT abilities globally.	Semantic Scholar
However, it is difficult to accurately estimate the behavior pattern from trajectory data because the trajectory contains a high level of measurement noise.	Semantic Scholar
We employed flight muscle electromyograms, whose motor commands were assumed to be generated in the same ganglion as the behavior, to estimate the behavior pattern using a support vector machine.	Semantic Scholar
By using the estimated results, we modeled the time-varying behavioral change of insects and verified the effectiveness of the phenomenon for CPT using the constructive approach.	Semantic Scholar
We named this time-varying CPT algorithm as time-varying moth-inspired algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
From the CPT experiment results using the robot, we found that the localization success rate improved by changing the behavior in a time-variant manner.	Semantic Scholar
This paper deals with the stabilization problem of memristive recurrent neural networks with inertial items, discrete delays, bounded and unbounded distributed delays.	Semantic Scholar
First, for inertial memristive recurrent neural networks (IMRNNs) with second-order derivatives of states, an appropriate variable substitution method is invoked to transfer IMRNNs into a first-order differential form.	Semantic Scholar
Then, based on nonsmooth analysis theory, several algebraic criteria are established for the global stabilizability of IMRNNs under proposed feedback control, where the cases with both bounded and unbounded distributed delays are successfully addressed.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the theoretical results are illustrated via the numerical simulations.	Semantic Scholar
To enable robots to perform human-level tasks flexibly in varying conditions, we need a mechanism that allows them to exchange knowledge between themselves for crowd-sourcing the knowledge gap problem.	Semantic Scholar
One approach to achieve this is to equip a cloud application with a range of encyclopedic knowledge (i.e., ontologies) and execution logs of different robots performing the same tasks in different environments.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we show how knowledge exchange between robots can be done using openEASE as the cloud application.	Semantic Scholar
We equipped openEASE with ontologies about the kitchen domain, execution logs of three robots operating in two different kitchens, and semantic descriptions of both environments.	Semantic Scholar
By addressing two different use cases, we show that two PR2 robots and one Fetch robot can successfully adapt each other's plan parameters and subsymbolic data to the experiments that they are conducting.	Semantic Scholar
The endpoint stiffness of the human arm has been long recognized as a key component ensuring the quasi-static stability of the arm physical interactions with the external world.	Semantic Scholar
Similarly, the understanding of the joint stiffness behavior can provide complementary insights, e.g., on the underlying stiffness regulation principles across different joints including the nullspace stiffness profiles.	Semantic Scholar
Traditionally, the experimental modeling and estimation of the human arm joint stiffness is achieved by the transformation of the identified arm endpoint stiffness to the joint coordinates.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the underlying kinematic redundancy, the obtained joint stiffness matrix is rank-deficient which implies that the information in the joint stiffness matrix is incomplete.	Semantic Scholar
While in robotics applications this issue can be addressed by designing a desired nullspace stiffness behavior through appropriate projections, the use of a similar technique in the identification of human joint stiffness profile is meaningless.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, the first objective of this work is to address this issue by developing a novel technique to identify the complete and physiologically meaningful joint stiffness of human arm.	Semantic Scholar
Second, we present a model-based online estimation technique to estimate the seven-dimensional complete joint stiffness in various arm poses and activation levels of the two dominant arm muscles that correspond to the geometric and volume modifications of the joint stiffness profile, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
Dynamic seated trunk control is required during the execution of many everyday tasks.	Semantic Scholar
These tasks require an intricate coordination between the head, upper and lower trunk, and the pelvis.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, reaching beyond the arm's length requires precise joint control and intersegmental coordination.	Semantic Scholar
With practice specificity, humans can learn particular motor skills that may be performed across contexts of similar characteristics.	Semantic Scholar
As new tasks are explored, human movements are learned and organized by the release and constraint of degrees-of-freedom, and the modulation of joint amplitudes that are specific to the task demands.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, by providing seated reach training without foot support that challenges postural control close to and beyond the stability limits or point of stability failure, an individual with an optimal level of trunk assistance could improve postural control by increasing the range of motion of the trunk and expand the boundaries that define the point of stability failure.	Semantic Scholar
We have developed a novel cable robotic device, trunk support trainer (TruST), which allows training of seated posture at and beyond an individual's point of stability failure during volitional trunk displacement.	Semantic Scholar
This is accomplished by creating a force tunnel to support posture beyond the sitting stability region.	Semantic Scholar
The system provides an assist-as-needed force strategy to support the trunk.	Semantic Scholar
We conducted a proof-of-concept study with 20 healthy adult subjects (10 experimental and 10 control) to investigate the changes in lower trunk center of mass (COM) displacement and trunk kinematics.	Semantic Scholar
Our study supports the hypothesis that a single training session with TruST at and beyond the point of stability failure increases lower trunk COM displacement and increases the lower trunk and pelvic rotation.	Semantic Scholar
The findings suggest that this approach may be useful for training patients with neurological and musculoskeletal disorders where children or adults have compromised postural stability.	Semantic Scholar
Machine learning algorithms often suffer from good generalization in testing domains especially when the training (source) and test (target) domains do not have similar distributions.	Semantic Scholar
To address this problem, several domain adaptation techniques have been proposed to improve the performance of the learning algorithms when they face accuracy degradation caused by the domain shift problem.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we focus on the non-homogeneous distributed target domains and propose a new latent subdomain discovery model to divide the target domain into subdomains while adapting them.	Semantic Scholar
It is expected that applying adaptation on subdomains increase the rate of detection in comparing with the situation that the target domain is seen as one single domain.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed division method considers each subdomain as a cluster which has the definite ratio of positive to negative samples, linear discriminability and conditional distribution similarity to the source domain.	Semantic Scholar
This method divides the target domain into subdomains while adapting the trained target classifier for each subdomain using Adapt-SVM adaptation method.	Semantic Scholar
It also has a simple solution for selecting the appropriate number of subdomains.	Semantic Scholar
We call our proposed method Cluster-based Adaptive SVM or CA-SVM in short.	Semantic Scholar
We test CA-SVM on two different computer vision problems, pedestrian detection and image classification.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results show the advantage in accuracy rate for our approach in comparison to several baselines.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a robust subspace learning (SL) framework for dimensionality reduction which further extends the existing SL methods to a low-rank and sparse embedding (LRSE) framework from three aspects: overall optimum, robustness and generalization.	Semantic Scholar
Owing to the uses of low-rank and sparse constraints, both the global subspaces and local geometric structures of data are captured by the reconstruction coefficient matrix and at the same time the low-dimensional embedding of data are enforced to respect the low-rankness and sparsity.	Semantic Scholar
In this way, the reconstruction coefficient matrix learning and SL are jointly performed, which can guarantee an overall optimum.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we adopt a sparse matrix to model the noise which makes LRSE robust to the different types of noise.	Semantic Scholar
The combination of global subspaces and local geometric structures brings better generalization for LRSE than related methods, i.e., LRSE performs better than conventional SL methods in unsupervised and supervised scenarios, particularly in unsupervised scenario the improvement of classification accuracy is considerable.	Semantic Scholar
Seven specific SL methods including unsupervised and supervised methods can be derived from the proposed framework and the experiments on different data sets (including corrupted data) demonstrate the superiority of these methods over the existing, well-established SL methods.	Semantic Scholar
Further, we exploit experiments to provide some new insights for SL.	Semantic Scholar
Although quadrotors, and aerial robots in general, are inherently active agents, their perceptual capabilities in literature so far have been mostly passive in nature.	Semantic Scholar
Researchers and practitioners today use traditional computer vision algorithms with the aim of building a representation of general applicability: a 3-D reconstruction of the scene.	Semantic Scholar
Using this representation, planning tasks are constructed and accomplished to allow the quadrotor to demonstrate autonomous behavior.	Semantic Scholar
These methods are inefficient as they are not task driven and such methodologies are not utilized by flying insects and birds.	Semantic Scholar
Such agents have been solving the problem of navigation and complex control for ages without the need to build a 3-D map and are highly task driven.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose this framework of bioinspired perceptual design for quadrotors.	Semantic Scholar
We use this philosophy to design a minimalist sensorimotor framework for a quadrotor to fly through unknown gaps without an explicit 3-D reconstruction of the scene using only a monocular camera and onboard sensing.	Semantic Scholar
We successfully evaluate and demonstrate the proposed approach in many real-world experiments with different settings and window shapes, achieving a success rate of 85% at 2.5 ms $^{-1}$ even with a minimum tolerance of just 5 cm.	Semantic Scholar
To best of our knowledge, this is the first letter that addresses the problem of gap detection of an unknown shape and location with a monocular camera and onboard sensing.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present an approach for learning in-hand manipulation skills with a low-cost, underactuated prosthetic hand in the presence of irreversible events.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach combines reinforcement learning based on visual perception with low-level reactive control based on tactile perception, which aims to avoid slipping.	Semantic Scholar
The objective of the reinforcement learning level consists not only in fulfilling the in-hand manipulation goal, but also in minimizing the intervention of the tactile reactive control.	Semantic Scholar
This way, the occurrence of object slipping during the learning procedure, which we consider an irreversible event, is significantly reduced.	Semantic Scholar
When an irreversible event occurs, the learning process is considered failed.	Semantic Scholar
We show the performance in two tasks, which consist in reorienting a cup and a bottle only using the fingers.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results show that the proposed architecture allows reaching the goal in the Cartesian space and reduces significantly the occurrence of object slipping during the learning procedure.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, without the proposed synergy between reactive control and reinforcement learning it was not possible to avoid irreversible events and, therefore, to learn the task.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a dynamic trajectory planning technique for six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) cable-suspended parallel robots (CSPRs).	Semantic Scholar
First, a passive mechanical system that is equivalent to the CSPR is introduced to provide insight and facilitate the design of trajectories that can extend beyond the robot's static workspace.	Semantic Scholar
The tilt-and-torsion angle convention is used to develop the mathematical model and impose restrictions for the rotational component of the trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
The dynamic differential equations that govern the translational component of the trajectories are shown to become linear under some conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Natural frequencies of an equivalent passive linear system of constant-stiffness springs are, thus, obtained and the set of linear differential equations associated with this system is integrated to produce a general solution for natural, periodic trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
This approach is used to produce pure translation trajectories and more complex motion that includes changes in position and orientation.	Semantic Scholar
An experimental implementation is also presented using a 6-DOF prototype and a supplementary video file is included to demonstrate the results.	Semantic Scholar

Object tracking is challenging as target objects often undergo drastic appearance changes over time.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, adaptive correlation filters have been successfully applied to object tracking.	Semantic Scholar
However, tracking algorithms relying on highly adaptive correlation filters are prone to drift due to noisy updates.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, as these algorithms do not maintain long-term memory of target appearance, they cannot recover from tracking failures caused by heavy occlusion or target disappearance in the camera view.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose to learn multiple adaptive correlation filters with both long-term and short-term memory of target appearance for robust object tracking.	Semantic Scholar
First, we learn a kernelized correlation filter with an aggressive learning rate for locating target objects precisely.	Semantic Scholar
We take into account the appropriate size of surrounding context and the feature representations.	Semantic Scholar
Second, we learn a correlation filter over a feature pyramid centered at the estimated target position for predicting scale changes.	Semantic Scholar
Third, we learn a complementary correlation filter with a conservative learning rate to maintain long-term memory of target appearance.	Semantic Scholar
We use the output responses of this long-term filter to determine if tracking failure occurs.	Semantic Scholar
In the case of tracking failures, we apply an incrementally learned detector to recover the target position in a sliding window fashion.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experimental results on large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents an approach to hand pose estimation that combines discriminative and model-based methods to leverage the advantages of both.	Semantic Scholar
Randomised Decision Forests are trained using real data to provide fast coarse segmentation of the hand.	Semantic Scholar
The segmentation then forms the basis of constraints applied in model fitting, using an efficient projected Gauss-Seidel solver, which enforces temporal continuity and kinematic limitations.	Semantic Scholar
However, when fitting a generic model to multiple users with varying hand shape, there is likely to be residual errors between the model and their hand.	Semantic Scholar
Also, local minima can lead to failures in tracking that are difficult to recover from.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we introduce an error regression stage that learns to correct these instances of optimisation failure.	Semantic Scholar
The approach provides improved accuracy over the current state of the art methods, through the inclusion of temporal cohesion and by learning to correct from failure cases.	Semantic Scholar
Using discriminative learning, our approach performs guided optimisation, greatly reducing model fitting complexity and radically improves efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
This allows tracking to be performed at over 40 frames per second using a single CPU thread.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, the boundedness and robust stability for a class of delayed complex-valued neural networks with interval parameter uncertainties are investigated.	Semantic Scholar
By using Homomorphic mapping theorem, Lyapunov method and inequality techniques, sufficient condition to guarantee the boundedness of networks and the existence, uniqueness and global robust stability of equilibrium point is derived for the considered uncertain neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
The obtained robust stability criterion is expressed in complex-valued LMI, which can be calculated numerically using YALMIP with solver of SDPT3 in MATLAB.	Semantic Scholar
An example with simulations is supplied to show the applicability and advantages of the acquired result.	Semantic Scholar

In any competitive business, success is based on the ability to make an item more appealing to customers than the competition.	Semantic Scholar
A number of questions arise in the context of this task: how do we formalize and quantify the competitiveness between two items?	Semantic Scholar
Who are the main competitors of a given item?	Semantic Scholar
What are the features of an item that most affect its competitiveness?	Semantic Scholar
Despite the impact and relevance of this problem to many domains, only a limited amount of work has been devoted toward an effective solution.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a formal definition of the competitiveness between two items, based on the market segments that they can both cover.	Semantic Scholar
Our evaluation of competitiveness utilizes customer reviews, an abundant source of information that is available in a wide range of domains.	Semantic Scholar
We present efficient methods for evaluating competitiveness in large review datasets and address the natural problem of finding the top-k competitors of a given item.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we evaluate the quality of our results and the scalability of our approach using multiple datasets from different domains.	Semantic Scholar
Uncertainty is intrinsic to a wide spectrum of real-life applications, which inevitably applies to graph data.	Semantic Scholar
Representative uncertain graphs are seen in bio-informatics, social networks, etc.	Semantic Scholar
This paper motivates the problem of frequent subgraph mining on single uncertain graphs, and investigates two different - probabilistic and expected - semantics in terms of support definitions.	Semantic Scholar
First, we present an enumeration-evaluation algorithm to solve the problem under probabilistic semantics.	Semantic Scholar
By showing the support computation under probabilistic semantics is #P-complete, we develop an approximation algorithm with accuracy guarantee for efficient problem-solving.	Semantic Scholar
To enhance the solution, we devise computation sharing techniques to achieve better mining performance.	Semantic Scholar
Afterwards, the algorithm is extended in a similar flavor to handle the problem under expected semantics, where checkpoint-based pruning and validation techniques are integrated.	Semantic Scholar
Experiment results on real-life datasets confirm the practical usability of the mining algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
In a social network, even about the same information the excitement between different users are different.	Semantic Scholar
If we want to spread a piece of new information and maximize the expected total amount of excitement, which seed users should we choose?	Semantic Scholar
This problem indeed is substantially different from the renowned influence maximization problem and cannot be tackled using the existing approaches.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, motivated by the demand in a few interesting applications, we model the novel problem of activity maximization, and tackle the problem systematically.	Semantic Scholar
We first analyze the complexity and the approximability of the problem.	Semantic Scholar
We develop an upper bound and a lower bound that are submodular so that the Sandwich framework can be applied.	Semantic Scholar
We then devise a polling-based randomized algorithm that guarantees a data dependent approximation factor.	Semantic Scholar
Our experiments on four real data sets clearly verify the effectiveness and scalability of our method, as well as the advantage of our method against the other heuristic methods.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we introduce a real-time face recognition (and announcement) system targeted at aiding the blind and low-vision people.	Semantic Scholar
The system uses a Microsoft Kinect sensor as a wearable device, performs face detection, and uses temporal coherence along with a simple biometric procedure to generate a sound associated with the identified person, virtualized at his/her estimated 3-D location.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach uses a variation of the K-nearest neighbors algorithm over histogram of oriented gradient descriptors dimensionally reduced by principal component analysis.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that our approach, on average, outperforms traditional face recognition methods while requiring much less computational resources (memory, processing power, and battery life) when compared with existing techniques in the literature, deeming it suitable for the wearable hardware constraints.	Semantic Scholar
We also show the performance of the system in the dark, using depth-only information acquired with Kinect's infrared camera.	Semantic Scholar
The validation uses a new dataset available for download, with 600 videos of 30 people, containing variation of illumination, background, and movement patterns.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments with existing datasets in the literature are also considered.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we conducted user experience evaluations on both blindfolded and visually impaired users, showing encouraging results.	Semantic Scholar
Soft pneumatic actuators enable robots to interact safely with complex environments, but often suffer from imprecise control and unpredictable dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
This letter addresses these challenges through the use of model reference adaptive control, which modulates the input to the plant to ensure that it behaves similarly to a reference dynamic model.	Semantic Scholar
We use adaptive control to standardize the performance of soft actuators and eliminate their nonlinear behavior.	Semantic Scholar
We implement an adaptive controller chosen for its simplicity and efficiency, and study the ability of this controller to force different soft pneumatic actuators to behave uniformly under a variety of conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Next, we formulate an inverse dynamic feedforward controller, allowing soft actuators to quickly follow reference trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
We test the performance of the proposed feedforward controller with and without the adaptive controller, to study its open-loop effectiveness and highlight the improvements the adaptive controller offers.	Semantic Scholar
Our experimental results indicate that soft actuators can follow unstructured continuous signals through the use of the proposed adaptive control approach.	Semantic Scholar
Ordinal Regression (OR) aims to model the ordering information between different data categories, which is a crucial topic in multi-label learning.	Semantic Scholar
An important class of approaches to OR models the problem as a linear combination of basis functions that map features to a high-dimensional non-linear space.	Semantic Scholar
However, most of the basis function-based algorithms are time consuming.	Semantic Scholar
We propose an incremental sparse Bayesian approach to OR tasks and introduce an algorithm to sequentially learn the relevant basis functions in the ordinal scenario.	Semantic Scholar
Our method, called Incremental Sparse Bayesian Ordinal Regression (ISBOR), automatically optimizes the hyper-parameters via the type-II maximum likelihood method.	Semantic Scholar
By exploiting fast marginal likelihood optimization, ISBOR can avoid big matrix inverses, which is the main bottleneck in applying basis function-based algorithms to OR tasks on large-scale datasets.	Semantic Scholar
We show that ISBOR can make accurate predictions with parsimonious basis functions while offering automatic estimates of the prediction uncertainty.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real word datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of ISBOR compared to other basis function-based OR approaches.	Semantic Scholar
Hand gestures commonly occur in daily dialogue interactions, and have important functions in communication.	Semantic Scholar
We first analyzed a multimodal human–human dialogue data and found relations between the occurrence of hand gestures and dialogue act categories.	Semantic Scholar
We also conducted a clustering analysis on gesture motion data, and associated text information with the gesture motion clusters through gesture function categories.	Semantic Scholar
Using the analysis results, we proposed a speech-driven gesture generation method by taking text, prosody, and dialogue act information into account.	Semantic Scholar
We then implemented a hand motion control to an android robot, and evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed gesture generation method through subjective experiments.	Semantic Scholar
The gesture motions generated by the proposed method were judged to be relatively natural even under the robot hardware constraints.	Semantic Scholar
This report is on the design, control strategy, implementation, and performance evaluation of a novel leg–wheel transformable robot called TurboQuad, which can perform fast gait/mode coordination and transitions in wheeled mode, in legged trotting, and in legged walking while in motion.	Semantic Scholar
This functionality was achieved by including two novel setups in the robot that were not included in its predecessor, Quattroped.	Semantic Scholar
First, a new leg–wheel mechanism was used, in which the leg/wheel operation and its in situ transition can be driven by the same set of motors, so the actuation system and power can be utilized efficiently.	Semantic Scholar
Second, a bio-inspired control strategy was applied based on the central pattern generator and coupled oscillator networks, in which the gait/mode generation, coordination, and transitions can be integrally controlled.	Semantic Scholar
The robot was empirically built and its performances in the described three gaits/modes as well as the transitions among them were experimentally evaluated and will be discussed in this paper.	Semantic Scholar

This letter presents an approach for semantic place categorization using data obtained from RGB cameras.	Semantic Scholar
Previous studies on visual place recognition and classification have shown that by considering features derived from pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in combination with part-based classification models, high recognition accuracy can be achieved, even in the presence of occlusions and severe viewpoint changes.	Semantic Scholar
Inspired by these works, we propose to exploit local deep representations, representing images as set of regions applying a Naïve Bayes nearest neighbor (NBNN) model for image classification.	Semantic Scholar
As opposed to previous methods, where CNNs are merely used as feature extractors, our approach seamlessly integrates the NBNN model into a fully CNN.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms previous methods based on pretrained CNN models and that, when employed in challenging robot place recognition tasks, it is robust to occlusions, environmental and sensor changes.	Semantic Scholar
We consider a vehicle consisting of a robotic walking assistant pushed by a user.	Semantic Scholar
The robot can guide the person along a path and suggest a velocity by various means.	Semantic Scholar
The vehicle moves in a crowded environment and can detect other pedestrians in the surroundings.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a reactive planner that modifies the path in order to avoid pedestrians in the surroundings.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm relies on a very accurate model to predict the motion of each pedestrian, i.e., the headed social force model.	Semantic Scholar
The possible trajectories for both the vehicle and the pedestrians are modeled as clothoid curves, which are efficient to manage from the numeric point of view and are very comfortable to follow for the user.	Semantic Scholar
Probabilistic techniques are used to account for the variability of the motion of each pedestrian.	Semantic Scholar
The path is efficient to generate, is collision free (up to a certain probability), and is comfortable to follow.	Semantic Scholar
Simulations and comparisons with a state-of-the-art planner using real data as well as experiments are reported to prove the effectiveness of the method.	Semantic Scholar
The paper introduces a class of memristor neural networks (NNs) that are characterized by the following salient features.	Semantic Scholar
(a) The processing of signals takes place in the flux-charge domain and is based on the time evolution of memristor charges.	Semantic Scholar
The processing result is given by the constant asymptotic values of charges that are stored in the memristors acting as non-volatile memories in steady state.	Semantic Scholar
(b) The dynamic equations describing the memristor NNs in the flux-charge domain are analogous to those describing, in the traditional voltage-current domain, the dynamics of a standard (S) cellular (C) NN, and are implemented by using a realistic model of memristors as that proposed by HP.	Semantic Scholar
This analogy makes it possible to use the bulk of results in the SCNN literature for designing memristor NNs to solve processing tasks in real time.	Semantic Scholar
Convergence of memristor NNs in the presence of multiple asymptotically stable equilibrium points is addressed and some applications to image processing tasks are presented to illustrate the real-time processing capabilities.	Semantic Scholar
Computing in the flux-charge domain is shown to have significant advantages with respect to computing in the voltage-current domain.	Semantic Scholar
One advantage is that, when a steady state is reached, currents, voltages and hence power in a memristor NN vanish, whereas memristors keep in memory the processing result.	Semantic Scholar
This is basically different from SCNNs for which currents, voltages and power do not vanish at a steady state, and batteries are needed to keep in memory the processing result.	Semantic Scholar
Display clutter causes decrements in visual search performance and can be a threat to safety and efficiency in complex, data-rich domains.	Semantic Scholar
Addressing the problem requires a means to detect the presence of clutter in real time, predict its effects, and then trigger countermeasures before breakdowns in information search can occur.	Semantic Scholar
Eye tracking is a promising technique for achieving these goals; however, to date, it has been used almost exclusively offline for display evaluation purposes.	Semantic Scholar
The goal of this research was instead to develop and evaluate models that combine eye tracking metrics to detect the effects of clutter early on in the search process.	Semantic Scholar
Participants were asked to locate targets in a simulated graphics program.	Semantic Scholar
Three eye tracking metrics—scanpath length, mean saccade amplitude, and mean fixation duration—were calculated over a 3-second time window.	Semantic Scholar
These metrics were then used as input to a set of logistic regression models to predict whether users’ response time will be relatively long or short.	Semantic Scholar
The accuracy of the models averaged 75% and the true positive rate was above 90%, with an ability to predict response time as early as 3.6 s into the visual search task.	Semantic Scholar
The results of this study confirm that eye tracking metrics can be used to predict the effects of display clutter in real time.	Semantic Scholar
They add to the knowledge base in attention and eye tracking, and they ultimately contribute to the design of adaptive displays that lead to improved operator performance.	Semantic Scholar
In real-world applications, the oracle who can label all instances correctly may not exist or may be too expensive to acquire.	Semantic Scholar
Alternatively, crowdsourcing provides an easy way to get labels at a low cost from multiple non-expert annotators.	Semantic Scholar
During the past few years, much attention has been paid to learning from such crowdsourcing data, namely Learning from Crowds (LFC).	Semantic Scholar
Despite their proper statistical foundations, the existing methods for LFC still suffer from several disadvantages, such as needing prior knowledge to select the expertise model to represent the behavior of annotators, involving non-convex optimization problems, or restricting the classifier type being used.	Semantic Scholar
This paper addresses LFC from a quality-sensitive perspective and presents a novel framework named QS-LFC.	Semantic Scholar
Through reformulating the original LFC problem as a quality-sensitive learning problem, the above-mentioned disadvantages of existing methods can be avoided.	Semantic Scholar
Further, a support vector machine (SVM) implementation of QS-LFC is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that QS-LFC can achieve better generalization performance and is more robust to the noisy labels, than the existing methods.	Semantic Scholar
Online reviews are important decision aids to consumers.	Semantic Scholar
Other than helping users to evaluate individual products, reviews also support comparison shopping by comparing two (or more) products based on a specific aspect.	Semantic Scholar
However, making a comparison across two different reviews, written by different authors, is not always equitable due to the different standards and preferences of authors.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we focus on comparative sentences, whereby two products are compared directly by a review author within a sentence.	Semantic Scholar
We study the problem of comparative relation mining.	Semantic Scholar
Given a set of comparative sentences, each relating a pair of entities, our objective is three-fold: to interpret the comparative direction in each sentence, to identify the aspect of each sentence, and to determine the relative merits of each entity with respect to that aspect.	Semantic Scholar
This requires mining comparative relations at two levels of resolution: at the sentence level, and at the entity level.	Semantic Scholar
Our insight is that there is a significant synergy between the two levels.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a generative model for comparative text, which jointly models comparative directions at the sentence level, and ranking at the entity level.	Semantic Scholar
This model is tested comprehensively on Amazon reviews dataset with good empirical outperformance over pipelined baselines.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we propose a novel way to consider the clustering and the reduction of the dimension simultaneously.	Semantic Scholar
Indeed, our approach takes advantage of the mutual reinforcement between data reduction and clustering tasks.	Semantic Scholar
The use of a low-dimensional representation can be of help in providing simpler and more interpretable solutions.	Semantic Scholar
We show that by doing so, our model is able to better approximate the relaxed continuous dimension reduction solution by the true discrete clustering solution.	Semantic Scholar
Experiment results show that our method gives better results in terms of clustering than the state-of-the-art algorithms devoted to similar tasks for data sets with different proprieties.	Semantic Scholar
A simple way to mitigate the potential negative side-effects associated with chemical lysis of a blood clot is to tear its fibrin network via mechanical rubbing using a helical robot.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we achieve mechanical rubbing of blood clots under ultrasound guidance and using external magnetic actuation.	Semantic Scholar
Position of the helical robot is determined using ultrasound feedback and used to control its motion toward the clot, whereas the volume of the clots is estimated simultaneously using visual feedback.	Semantic Scholar
We characterize the shear modulus and ultimate shear strength of the blood clots to predict their removal rate during rubbing.	Semantic Scholar

Transparency, defined as the ability of a robot to exert nil interaction force on the user, is a key requirement for any wearable robot for assistance, rehabilitation, or functional augmentation.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we propose a new controller to improve the transparency of a powered orthosis.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed controller takes advantage of the cyclic nature of human walking to predict the upcoming undesired interaction forces and compensate them in real time.	Semantic Scholar
Results from validation tests with a group of $N=12$ healthy subjects who walked with a powered ankle-foot orthosis indicate that the proposed controller can reduce undesired interaction torques by 19.1% at slow speed and 17.43% at fast speed, compared to a conventional zero-torque controller.	Semantic Scholar
When the same controller was implemented in a semiactive actuation mode, these figures increased to 20.06% and 19.59%, respectively, proving the versatility of the proposed approach.	Semantic Scholar
Two-node attractor networks are flexible models for neural activity during decision making.	Semantic Scholar
Depending on the network configuration, these networks can model distinct aspects of decisions including evidence integration, evidence categorization, and decision memory.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we use attractor networks to model recent causal perturbations of the frontal orienting fields (FOF) in rat cortex during a perceptual decision-making task (Erlich, Brunton, Duan, Hanks, & Brody, 2015).	Semantic Scholar
We focus on a striking feature of the perturbation results.	Semantic Scholar
Pharmacological silencing of the FOF resulted in a stimulus-independent bias.	Semantic Scholar
We fit several models to test whether integration, categorization, or decision memory could account for this bias and found that only the memory configuration successfully accounts for it.	Semantic Scholar
This memory model naturally accounts for optogenetic perturbations of FOF in the same task and correctly predicts a memory-duration-dependent deficit caused by silencing FOF in a different task.	Semantic Scholar
Our results provide mechanistic support for a “postcategorization” memory role of the FOF in upcoming choices.	Semantic Scholar
Magnet-tipped, elastic rods can be steered by an external magnetic field to perform surgical tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Such rods could be useful for a range of new medical applications because they do not require either pull wires or other bulky mechanisms that are problematic in small anatomical regions.	Semantic Scholar
However, current magnetic rod steering systems are large and expensive.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we describe a method to guide a rod using a robot-manipulated magnet located near a patient.	Semantic Scholar
We solve for rod deflections by combining permanent-magnet models with a Kirchhoff elastic rod model and use a resolved-rate approach to compute trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments show that three-dimensional trajectories can be executed accurately without feedback and that the system's redundancy can be exploited to avoid obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
In robotic minimally invasive surgery, the incision point acts as a fulcrum around which the surgical instrument pivots.	Semantic Scholar
The fulcrum point has been the topic of much research.	Semantic Scholar
Mechanisms have been invented to enforce instrument motion about such a fulcrum.	Semantic Scholar
Other systems establish a fulcrum through coordinated control of their joints.	Semantic Scholar
For laparoscopists, the fulcrum point is an obstacle to overcome through a lot of training.	Semantic Scholar
For robots, it is a hurdle requiring careful consideration.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, new estimation methods are proposed to exploit the properties of a fulcrum and turn its presence into an advantage.	Semantic Scholar
This letter starts by presenting a novel fulcrum estimation method that is robust against measurement noise and quantization effects.	Semantic Scholar
A general fulcrum refinement method is proposed next.	Semantic Scholar
This method can be used as add-on to ameliorate alternative estimation approaches.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown how the fulcrum can also be leveraged to get accurate, high-bandwidth estimates of the instrument tip.	Semantic Scholar
The quality with which the instrument tip is estimated has a large impact on the performance of advanced guidance schemes, such as haptic virtual walls.	Semantic Scholar
User tests are included, demonstrating substantially improved guidance thanks to the algorithms presented in this work.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents an approach for reconstructing large-scale outdoor scenes through monocular motion stereo at interactive frame rates on a modern mobile device (Google Project Tango Development Kit Tablet).	Semantic Scholar
The device’s fisheye camera enables a user to reconstruct large scenes in only a few minutes by simply walking through the scene.	Semantic Scholar
We utilize the device’s GPU to compute depth maps via plane sweep stereo.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to reconstructing small objects, we observe that in large-scale scenarios using motion stereo, free-space measurements are less effective for suppressing outliers due to limited possibilities for camera placement and an unbounded reconstruction volume.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the outlier ratio in depth maps from stereo matching is much higher compared to images from depth sensors.	Semantic Scholar
Consequently, we propose a set of filtering steps to detect and discard unreliable depth measurements.	Semantic Scholar
The remaining parts of the depth maps are then integrated into a volumetric representation of the scene using a truncated signed distance function.	Semantic Scholar
Ours is the first method to enable live reconstruction of large outdoor scenes on a mobile device.	Semantic Scholar
We extensively evaluate our approach, demonstrating the benefit of rigorously filtering depth maps.	Semantic Scholar
How can a robot design a sequence of grasping actions that will succeed despite the presence of bounded state uncertainty and an inherently stochastic system?	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a probabilistic algorithm that generates sequential actions to iteratively reduce uncertainty until object pose is uniquely known (subject to symmetry).	Semantic Scholar
The plans assume encoder feedback that gives a geometric partition of the post-grasp configuration space based on contact conditions.	Semantic Scholar
An offline planning tree is generated by interleaving computationally tractable open-loop action sequence search and feedback state estimation with particle filtering.	Semantic Scholar
To speed up planning, we use learned approximate forward motion models, sensor models, and collision detectors.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm on robotic experiments with more than 3000 grasp sequences using different object shapes, press-ure distributions, and gripper materials where the uncertainty region is comparable to the size of the object in translation and with no information about orientation.

Grounding of kinesthetic feedback against a user's hand can increase the portability and wearability of a haptic device.	Semantic Scholar
However, the effects of different hand-grounding locations on haptic perception of a user are unknown.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we investigate the effects of three different hand-grounding locations—back of the hand, proximal phalanx of the index finger, and middle phalanx of the index finger—on haptic perception using a newly designed wearable haptic device.	Semantic Scholar
The novel device can provide kinesthetic feedback to the user's index finger in two directions: along the finger-axis and in the finger's flexion-extension movement direction.	Semantic Scholar
We measure users’ haptic perception for each grounding location through a psychophysical experiment for each of the two feedback directions.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that among the studied locations, grounding at proximal phalanx has a smaller average just noticeable difference for both feedback directions, indicating a more sensitive haptic perception.	Semantic Scholar
The realism of the haptic feedback, based on user ratings, was the highest with grounding at the middle phalanx for feedback along the finger axis, and at the proximal phalanx for feedback in the flexion-extension direction.	Semantic Scholar
Users identified the haptic feedback as most comfortable with grounding at the back of the hand for feedback along the finger axis and at the proximal phalanx for feedback in the flexion-extension direction.	Semantic Scholar
These findings show that the choice of grounding location has a significant impact on the user's haptic perception and qualitative experience.	Semantic Scholar
The results provide insights for designing next-generation wearable hand-grounded kinesthetic devices to achieve better haptic performance and user experience in virtual reality and teleoperated robotic applications.	Semantic Scholar
When walking robots and exoskeletons make multiple independent contacts, the inverse dynamics problem requires additional knowledge about the contact forces and moments.	Semantic Scholar
To avoid measuring the contact forces and moments, many inverse dynamics controllers for walking robots optimize an objective such as minimizing torques or contact forces.	Semantic Scholar
In order to get a solution closer to the real solution, the underlying physical principles need to be included.	Semantic Scholar
This is achieved by relying on the minimization of complementary energy, which is a well known method in structural engineering.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method relies on physical properties (stiffness) to obtain the additional knowledge to solve the contact forces and moments.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, it has the same form as the methods used in the literature.	Semantic Scholar
The validation on a bilateral lower-limb exoskeleton shows that the proposed method is able to predict the contact forces and moments sufficiently well, while being robust against modeling errors.	Semantic Scholar
The modeling dominating flexibilities suffices to achieve adequate results, making this method especially interesting for series elastic actuated robots.	Semantic Scholar
The neural correlates of decision making have been extensively studied with tasks involving a choice between two alternatives that is guided by visual cues.	Semantic Scholar
While a large body of work argues for a role of the lateral intraparietal (LIP) region of cortex in these tasks, this role may be confounded by the interaction between LIP and other regions, including medial temporal (MT) cortex.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we describe a simplified linear model of decision making that is adapted to two tasks: a motion discrimination and a categorization task.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the distinct contribution of MT and LIP may indeed be confounded in these tasks.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we argue that the motion discrimination task relies on a straightforward visuomotor mapping, which leads to redundant information between MT and LIP.	Semantic Scholar
The categorization task requires a more complex mapping between visual information and decision behavior, and therefore does not lead to redundancy between MT and LIP.	Semantic Scholar
Going further, the model predicts that noise correlations within LIP should be greater in the categorization compared to the motion discrimination task due to the presence of shared inputs from MT.	Semantic Scholar
The impact of these correlations on task performance is examined by analytically deriving error estimates of an optimal linear readout for shared and unique inputs.	Semantic Scholar
Taken together, results clarify the contribution of MT and LIP to decision making and help characterize the role of noise correlations in these regions.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, snake-like robots are proposed to assist experts during medical procedures on internal organs via natural orifices.	Semantic Scholar
Despite their well-spelt advantages, applications in radiosurgery is still hindered by absence of suitable designs required for spatial navigations within clustered and confined parts of human body, and inexistence of precise and fast inverse kinematics (IK) models.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, a deeply-learnt damped least squares method is proposed for solving IK of spatial snake-like robot.	Semantic Scholar
The robot's model consists of several modules, and each module has a pair of serial-links connected with orthogonal twists.	Semantic Scholar
For precise control of the robot's end-effector, damped least-squares approach is used to minimize error magnitude in a function modeled over analytical Jacobian of the robot.	Semantic Scholar
This is iteratively done until an apt joint vector needed to converge the robot to desired positions is obtained.	Semantic Scholar
For fast control and singularity avoidance, a deep network is built for prediction of unique damping factor required for each target point in the robot's workspace.	Semantic Scholar
The deep network consists of 11 x 15 array of neurons at the hidden layer, and deeply-learnt with a huge dataset of 877,500 data points generated from workspace of the snake robot.	Semantic Scholar
Implementation results for both simulated and actual prototype of an eight-link model of the robot show the effectiveness of the proposed IK method.	Semantic Scholar
With error tolerance of 0.01 mm, the proposed method has a very high reachability measure of 91.59% and faster mean execution time of 9.20 (±16.92) ms for convergence.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the method requires an average of 33.02 (±39.60) iterations to solve the IK problem.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, approximately 3.6 iterations can be executed in 1 ms.	Semantic Scholar
Evaluation against popularly used IK methods shows that the proposed method has very good performance in terms of accuracy and speed, simultaneously.	Semantic Scholar
This letter introduces a new iterative method for contact dynamics problems.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method is based on an efficient bisection method which iterates over each contact.	Semantic Scholar
We compared our approach to two existing ones for the same model and found that it is about twice as fast as the existing ones.	Semantic Scholar
We also introduce four different robotic simulation experiments and compare the proposed method to the most common contact solver, the projected Gauss–Seidel (PGS) method.	Semantic Scholar
We show that, while both methods are very efficient in solving simple problems, the proposed method significantly outperforms the PGS method in more complicated contact scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
Simulating one time step of an 18-DOF quadruped robot with multiple contacts took less than 20  $\mu$s with a single core of a CPU.	Semantic Scholar
This is at least an order of magnitude faster than many other simulators which employ multiple relaxation methods to the major dynamic principles in order to boost their computational speed.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed simulation method is also stable at 50 Hz due to its strict adherence to the dynamical principles.	Semantic Scholar
Although the accuracy might be compromised at such a low update rate, this means that we can simulate an 18-DOF robot more than thousand times faster than the real time.	Semantic Scholar
This article presents JinjaThreads, a unified, type-safe model of multithreaded Java source code and bytecode formalised in the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL.	Semantic Scholar
The semantics strictly separates sequential aspects from multithreading features like locks, forks and joins, interrupts, and the wait-notify mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
This separation yields an interleaving framework and a notion of deadlocks that are independent of the language, and makes the type safety proofs modular.	Semantic Scholar
JinjaThreads’s non-optimising compiler translates source code into bytecode.	Semantic Scholar
Its correctness proof guarantees that the generated bytecode exhibits exactly the same observable behaviours as the source code, even for infinite executions and under the Java memory model.	Semantic Scholar
The semantics and the compiler are executable.	Semantic Scholar
JinjaThreads builds on and reuses the Java formalisations Jinja, Bali, $$\mu $$ μ Java, and Java$$^{\ell ight}$$ ℓight by Nipkow’s group.	Semantic Scholar
Being the result of more than fifteen years of studying Java in Isabelle/HOL, it constitutes a large and long-lasting case study.	Semantic Scholar
It shows that fairly standard formalisation techniques scale well and highlights the challenges, benefits, and drawbacks of formalisation reuse.	Semantic Scholar

We propose a robust Alternating Low-Rank Representation (ALRR) model formed by an alternating forward-backward representation process.	Semantic Scholar
For forward representation, ALRR first recovers the low-rank PCs and random corruptions by an adaptive local Robust PCA (RPCA).	Semantic Scholar
Then, ALRR performs a joint Lp-norm and L2,p-norm minimization (0<p <1) based sparse LRR by taking the low-rank PCs as inputs and dictionary instead of using the original noisy data to learn the coding coefficients for subspace recovery, where the Lp-norm on the coefficients can ensure joint sparsity for subspace representation, while the L2,p-norm on the reconstruction error can handle outlier pursuit.	Semantic Scholar
After that, ALRR returns the coefficients as adaptive weights to local RPCA for updating PCs and dictionary in the backward representation process.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, ALRR is regarded as an integration of local RPCA with adaptive weights plus sparse LRR with a self-expressive low-rank dictionary.	Semantic Scholar
To enable ALRR to handle outside data efficiently, a projective ALRR that can extract features from data directly by embedding is also derived.	Semantic Scholar
To solve the L2,p-norm based minimization problem, a new iterative scheme based on the Iterative Shrinkage/Thresholding (IST) approach is presented.	Semantic Scholar
The relationship analysis with other related criteria show that our methods are more general.	Semantic Scholar
Visual and numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms for representation.	Semantic Scholar
Understanding the functions of the visual system has been one of the major targets in neuroscience for many years.	Semantic Scholar
However, the relation between spontaneous brain activities and visual saliency in natural stimuli has yet to be elucidated.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we developed an optimized machine learning-based decoding model to explore the possible relationships between the electroencephalography (EEG) characteristics and visual saliency.	Semantic Scholar
The optimal features were extracted from the EEG signals and saliency map which was computed according to an unsupervised saliency model (Tavakoli and Laaksonen, 2017).	Semantic Scholar
Subsequently, various unsupervised feature selection/extraction techniques were examined using different supervised regression models.	Semantic Scholar
The robustness of the presented model was fully verified by means of ten-fold or nested cross validation procedure, and promising results were achieved in the reconstruction of saliency features based on the selected EEG characteristics.	Semantic Scholar
Through the successful demonstration of using EEG characteristics to predict the real-time saliency distribution in natural videos, we suggest the feasibility of quantifying visual content through measuring brain activities (EEG signals) in real environments, which would facilitate the understanding of cortical involvement in the processing of natural visual stimuli and application developments motivated by human visual processing.	Semantic Scholar
Enabling effective human–robot interaction is crucial for any service robotics application.	Semantic Scholar
In this context, a fundamental aspect is the development of a user-friendly human–robot interface, such as a natural language interface.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we investigate the robot side of the interface, in particular the ability to generate natural language descriptions for the scene it observes.	Semantic Scholar
We achieve this capability via a deep recurrent neural network architecture completely based on the gated recurrent unit paradigm.	Semantic Scholar
The robot is able to generate complete sentences describing the scene, dealing with the hierarchical nature of the temporal information contained in image sequences.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach has fewer parameters than previous state-of-the-art architectures, thus it is faster to train and smaller in memory occupancy.	Semantic Scholar
These benefits do not affect the prediction performance.	Semantic Scholar
In fact, we show that our method outperforms or is comparable to previous approaches in terms of quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluation when tested on benchmark publicly available datasets and on a new dataset we introduce in this letter.	Semantic Scholar

It eliminates the complex masking process in traditional semiconductor manufacturing, thus enables flexible electronics designs and reduces manufacturing cost.	Semantic Scholar
However, the quality control of AJP processes is still a challenging problem, primarily due to the lack of understanding of the potential root causes of the quality issues.	Semantic Scholar
There is a complex interaction among the process setting variables, in situ features, and product quality in AJP processes.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, an ensemble modeling strategy is proposed to quantify the effect of the process setting variables on the in situ features, and the effect of the in situ features on the product quality in a two-level hierarchical way.	Semantic Scholar
By identifying significant in situ features as responses for the process setting variables, as well as significant predictors for the product quality in a joint model estimation problem, the proposed model has a hierarchical variable relationship to enable the in situ process control for variation reduction and defect mitigation.	Semantic Scholar
A real case study is investigated to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
Clinical Guidelines (CGs) provide general evidence-based recommendations and physicians often have to resort also to their Basic Medical Knowledge (BMK) to cope with specific patients.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we explore the interplay between CGs and BMK from the viewpoint of a-posteriori conformance analysis, intended as the adherence of a specific execution log to both the CG and the BMK.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we consider also the temporal dimension: the guideline may include temporal constraints for the execution of actions, and its adaptation to a specific patient and context may add or modify conditions and temporal constraints for actions.	Semantic Scholar
We propose an approach for analyzing execution traces in Answer Set Programming with respect to a guideline and BMK, pointing out discrepancies – including temporal discrepancies – with respect to the different knowledge sources, and providing explanations regarding how the applications of the CG and the BMK have interacted, especially in case strictly adhering to both is not possible.

Although as robot involvement in manufacturing for the transportation industry has increased dramatically in recent years [1], over 60% of automotive assembly tasks are still accomplished manually by human workers.	Semantic Scholar
The automotive assembly line presents numerous challenges, such as significant variability in tools and parts, flexible tasks, and unstructured and dynamic environments that preclude direct automation via traditional fenced robotic work cells.	Semantic Scholar
While human-robot collaboration offers a technically viable means to integrate robotic systems into automotive assembly [2]-[4], the lack of suitable robotic systems remains a challenge.	Semantic Scholar
Multifinger caging offers a robust object grasping approach.	Semantic Scholar
While efficient computation of two-finger caging grasps is well developed, the computation of three-finger caging grasps has remained a challenging open problem.	Semantic Scholar
This letter considers the caging of polygonal objects with three-finger hands which maintain an equilateral triangle  formation during the grasping process.	Semantic Scholar
While the c-space of such hands is four-dimensional (4-D), their contact space which represents all two and three finger contacts along the grasped object's boundary forms a 2-D stratified manifold.	Semantic Scholar
The letter describes a caging graph that can be constructed in the hand's relatively simple contact space.	Semantic Scholar
Starting from a desired immobilizing grasp of the object, the caging graph is searched for the largest finger opening that maintains a three-finger cage about the object.	Semantic Scholar
This finger opening determines the caging regions, and any equilateral finger placement within the caging regions guarantees a robust object grasping.	Semantic Scholar
The technique is illustrated with a detailed example and a video showing caging experiments with an equilateral robot hand.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we consider the predecessor-following control problem for a platoon of car-like vehicles moving on a planar surface with cyclic obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
Each vehicle is equipped with an on-board camera that detects its preceding vehicle, and a laser scanner that detects the obstacles around it.	Semantic Scholar
Within this framework, we design a fully decentralized control scheme, in the sense that each vehicle calculates its own control signal incorporating only local information, acquired by its on-board camera and laser scanner.	Semantic Scholar
Collisions with obstacles, collisions between successive vehicles and connectivity breaks owing to the limited field of view of the camera as well as to visual occlusions raised by static obstacles are provably avoided.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the transient and steady-state response of the closed-loop system is a priori determined by certain designer-specified functions and is fully decoupled by the number of vehicles in the platoon and the control gains selection.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, a simulation study is carried out in MATLAB and Coppelia Robotics V-REP to prove the control protocol's efficiency.	Semantic Scholar

Many previous proposals for adversarial training of deep neural nets have included directly modifying the gradient, training on a mix of original and adversarial examples, using contractive penalties, and approximately optimizing constrained adversarial objective functions.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we show that these proposals are actually all instances of optimizing a general, regularized objective we call DataGrad.	Semantic Scholar
Our proposed DataGrad framework, which can be viewed as a deep extension of the layerwise contractive autoencoder penalty, cleanly simplifies prior work and easily allows extensions such as adversarial training with multitask cues.	Semantic Scholar
In our experiments, we find that the deep gradient regularization of DataGrad (which also has L1 and L2 flavors of regularization) outperforms alternative forms of regularization, including classical L1, L2, and multitask, on both the original data set and adversarial sets.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we find that combining multitask optimization with DataGrad adversarial training results in the most robust performance.	Semantic Scholar
Individual areas in the brain are organized into a hierarchical network as a result of evolution.	Semantic Scholar
Previous work indicated that the receptive fields (RFs) of individual areas have been evolved to favor metabolically efficient neural codes.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose that not only the RFs of individual areas, but also the organization of adjacent neurons and the hierarchical structure composed of these areas have been evolved to support efficient coding.	Semantic Scholar
To verify this hypothesis, we introduce a feed-forward three-layer network to simulate the early stages of human visual system.	Semantic Scholar
We emphasize that the network is not a purely feed-forward one since it also includes intra-layer connections, which are essential but usually ignored in the literature.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation results strongly reveal that (1) the obtained RFs of the simulated retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) or neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and V1 simple neurons are consistent to the neurophysiological data; (2) the responses of closer RGCs are more correlated, and V1 simple neurons with similar orientations prefer to cluster together; (3) the hierarchical organization of the early visual system is beneficial for saving energy, which accords with the requirement of metabolically efficient neural coding in the process of human brain evolution.

Point cloud registration is a fundamental building block of many robotic applications.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we describe a system to solve the registration problem, that builds on top of our previous work [1], and that represents an extension to the well known Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach combines recent achievements on optimization by using an extended point representation [2] that captures the surface characteristics around the points.	Semantic Scholar
Thanks to an effective strategy to search for correspondences, our method can operate on-line and cope with measurements gathered with an heterogeneous set of range and depth sensors.	Semantic Scholar
By using an efficient map-merging procedure our approach can quickly update the tracked scene and handle dynamic aspects.	Semantic Scholar
We also introduce an approximated variant of our method that runs at twice the speed of our full implementation.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments performed on a large publicly available benchmarking dataset show that our approach performs better with respect to other state-of-the art methods.	Semantic Scholar
In most of the tests considered, our algorithm has been able to obtain a translational and rotational relative error of respectively ∼1 cm and ∼1 degree.	Semantic Scholar
We study the problem of structural graph clustering, a fundamental problem in managing and analyzing graph data.	Semantic Scholar
Given an undirected unweighted graph, structural graph clustering is to assign vertices to clusters, and to identify the sets of hub vertices and outlier vertices as well, such that vertices in the same cluster are densely connected to each other while vertices in different clusters are loosely connected.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we develop a new two-step paradigm for scalable structural graph clustering based on our three observations.	Semantic Scholar

Moreover, we propose efficient techniques for updating the clusters when the input graph dynamically changes, and we also extend our techniques to other similarity measures, e.g., Jaccard similarity.	Semantic Scholar
Performance studies on large real and synthetic graphs demonstrate the efficiency of our new approach and our dynamic cluster maintenance techniques.	Semantic Scholar
Noticeably, for the twitter graph with 1 billion edges, our approach takes 25 minutes while the state-of-the-art approach cannot finish even after 24 hours.	Semantic Scholar
As an emerging technology to support scalable content-based image retrieval (CBIR), hashing has recently received great attention and became a very active research domain.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we propose a novel unsupervised visual hashing approach called semantic-assisted visual hashing (SAVH).	Semantic Scholar
Distinguished from semi-supervised and supervised visual hashing, its core idea is to effectively extract the rich semantics latently embedded in auxiliary texts of images to boost the effectiveness of visual hashing without any explicit semantic labels.	Semantic Scholar
To achieve the target, a unified unsupervised framework is developed to learn hash codes by simultaneously preserving visual similarities of images, integrating the semantic assistance from auxiliary texts on modeling high-order relationships of inter-images, and characterizing the correlations between images and shared topics.	Semantic Scholar
Our performance study on three publicly available image collections: Wiki, MIR Flickr, and NUS-WIDE indicates that SAVH can achieve superior performance over several state-of-the-art techniques.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents an efficient framework to perform recognition and grasp detection of objects from RGB-D images of real scenes.	Semantic Scholar
The framework uses a novel architecture of hierarchical cascaded forests, in which object-class and grasp-pose probabilities are computed at different levels of an image hierarchy (e.g., patch and object levels) and fused to infer the class and the grasp of unseen objects.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce a novel training objective function that minimizes the uncertainties of the class labels and the grasp ground truths at the leaves of the forests, thereby enabling the framework to perform the recognition and grasp detection of objects.	Semantic Scholar
Our objective function is learned from features that are extracted from RGB-D point clouds of the objects.	Semantic Scholar
For that, we propose a novel method to encode an RGB-D point cloud into a representation that facilitates the use of large convolution neural networks to extract discriminative features from RGB-D images.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our framework on challenging object datasets, where we demonstrate that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of object-recognition and grasp-detection accuracies.	Semantic Scholar
We also show experiments by using live video streams from a Kinect mounted on our in-house robotic platform.	Semantic Scholar
Although the number of artificial neural network and machine learning architectures is growing at an exponential pace, more attention needs to be paid to theoretical guarantees of asymptotic convergence for novel, nonlinear, high-dimensional adaptive learning algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
When properly understood, such guarantees can guide the algorithm development and evaluation process and provide theoretical validation for a particular algorithm design.	Semantic Scholar
For many decades, the machine learning community has widely recognized the importance of stochastic approximation theory as a powerful tool for identifying explicit convergence conditions for adaptive learning machines.	Semantic Scholar
However, the verification of such conditions is challenging for multidisciplinary researchers not working in the area of stochastic approximation theory.	Semantic Scholar
For this reason, this letter presents a new stochastic approximation theorem for both passive and reactive learning environments with assumptions that are easily verifiable.	Semantic Scholar
The theorem is widely applicable to the analysis and design of important machine learning algorithms including deep learning algorithms with multiple strict local minimizers, Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithms, contrastive divergence learning in Markov fields, and policy gradient reinforcement learning.

The robotic system consists of an actuation module, a transmission module, and the robot module.	Semantic Scholar
The transmission module consist of a switching mechanism for reducing the required number of motors by half, an innovative linkage mechanism to insert and retract the robot with minimal tendon displacement and friction loss, and a quick-connect mechanism for easy attachment of the disposable MINIR-II.

Design, analysis, and development of each module are described in detail.	Semantic Scholar
Most of the critical components such as the robot, the quick-connect, the linkage mechanism, and various gear-pulley combinations in our design are 3-D printed.	Semantic Scholar
Preliminary mechanical properties characterization of the system and the capability of the underactuated system to replicate the critical functions of the 6-DoF robot are presented.	Semantic Scholar
The robot motion capability in a brain phantom model and its MRI compatibility in a 7-T magnet were verified.	Semantic Scholar
Clustering is an important aspect of data mining, while clustering high-dimensional mixed-attribute data in a scalable fashion still remains a challenging problem.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a tree-ensemble clustering algorithm for static datasets, CRAFTER, to tackle this problem.	Semantic Scholar
CRAFTER is able to handle categorical and numeric attributes simultaneously, and scales well with the dimensionality and the size of datasets.	Semantic Scholar
CRAFTER leverages the advantages of a tree-ensemble to handle mixed attributes and high dimensionality.	Semantic Scholar
The concept of the class probability estimates is utilized to identify the representative data points for clustering.	Semantic Scholar
Through a series of experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, we have demonstrated that CRAFTER is superior than Random Forest Clustering (RFC), an existing tree-based clustering method, in terms of both the clustering quality and the computational cost.	Semantic Scholar
Current underwater end-effector technology has limits in terms of finesse and versatility.	Semantic Scholar
Because of this, the execution of several underwater operations, such as archeological recovery and biological sampling, often still requires direct intervention by human operators, exposing them to the risks of working in a difficult environment.	Semantic Scholar
This article proposes the design and implementation of an underactuated and compliant underwater end effector that embodies grasp capabilities comparable to those of a scuba's real hand as well as the large grasping envelope of grippers.	Semantic Scholar
Based on an idea in Åström et al.	Semantic Scholar
(J Math ImagingVis, doi: 10.1007/s10851-016-0702-4 , 2017) we propose a new iterative multiplicative filtering algorithm for label assignment matrices which can be used for the supervised partitioning of data.	Semantic Scholar
Starting with a row-normalized matrix containing the averaged distances between prior features and observed ones, the method assigns in a very efficient way labels to the data.	Semantic Scholar
We interpret the algorithm as a gradient ascent method with respect to a certain function on the product manifold of positive numbers followed by a reprojection onto a subset of the probability simplex consisting of vectors whose components are bounded away from zero by a small constant.	Semantic Scholar
While such boundedness away from zero is necessary to avoid an arithmetic underflow, our convergence results imply that they are also necessary for theoretical reasons.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical examples show that the proposed simple and fast algorithm leads to very good results.	Semantic Scholar
In particular we apply the method for the partitioning of manifold-valued images.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a novel gripper, whose design was inspired by chuck clamping devices, for transferring heavy objects and assembling parts precisely in industrial applications.	Semantic Scholar

A fingertip design criterion is presented for the position alignment, while a control strategy is presented for the posture alignment.	Semantic Scholar
With one actuator, this gripper realized the above features.	Semantic Scholar

Direct visual localization has recently enjoyed a resurgence in popularity with the increasing availability of cheap mobile computing power.	Semantic Scholar
The competitive accuracy and robustness of these algorithms compared to state-of-the-art feature-based methods, as well as their natural ability to yield dense maps, makes them an appealing choice for a variety of mobile robotics applications.	Semantic Scholar
However, direct methods remain brittle in the face of appearance change due to their underlying assumption of photometric consistency, which is commonly violated in practice.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose to mitigate this problem by training deep convolutional encoder–decoder models to transform images of a scene such that they correspond to a previously seen canonical appearance.	Semantic Scholar
We validate our method in multiple environments and illumination conditions using high-fidelity synthetic RGB-D datasets, and integrate the trained models into a direct visual localization pipeline, yielding improvements in visual odometry accuracy through time-varying illumination conditions, as well as improved metric relocalization performance under illumination change, where conventional methods normally fail.	Semantic Scholar
We further provide a preliminary investigation of transfer learning from synthetic to real environments in a localization context.	Semantic Scholar
Tactile perception methods rely on creating mappings from tactile data to percepts.	Semantic Scholar
In many approaches to artificial tactile perception, this involves extensive sampling of the object during the training phase.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce here a method to instead generalize tactile features across different orientations.	Semantic Scholar
This method is applied to the TacTip v2, a three-dimensional printed optical tactile sensor with internal pins acting as taxels arranged with a 12-fold rotational symmetry.	Semantic Scholar
By rotating a small sample of tactile images, we are able to generalize tactile stimuli to new orientations.	Semantic Scholar
The method was validated across several tactile stimuli on an edge orientation classification task.	Semantic Scholar
Data were then generalized for a combination of orientations and locations of one of these stimuli, and this dataset was used as the basis for an exploratory control task: contour following around a circular disk.	Semantic Scholar
The generalization method leads to a strong reduction in the time needed to gather training data and only a moderate increase in classification error, and is particularly suited for multidimensional tactile data sampling in complex tasks such as tactile manipulation.	Semantic Scholar
We expect the method to generalize well to other tactile stimuli.	Semantic Scholar
Periodic up and down transitions of membrane potentials are considered to be a significant spontaneous activity.	Semantic Scholar
These kinds of oscillations always accompany with some spontaneous firing in up state.	Semantic Scholar
Our previous theoretical studies mainly looked at the subthreshold up and down transitions and characteristics of up and down dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we focus on suprathreshold spontaneous firing of up and down transitions based on improved network model and its stimulations.	Semantic Scholar
The simulated results indicate that fast sodium current is critical to the generation of spontaneous neural firing.	Semantic Scholar
While persistent sodium current plays a part in spontaneous fluctuation.	Semantic Scholar
Both intrinsic fast and persistent sodium dynamics influence spontaneous firing rate and synchronous activity in up and down behavior.	Semantic Scholar
Meanwhile, blocking excitatory synaptic transmission decreases neural firing and reveals spontaneous firing.	Semantic Scholar
These simulated results are basically in accordance with experimental results.	Semantic Scholar
Through the observation and analysis of the findings, we prove the validity of the model so we can further adopt this model to study other properties and characteristics of the network, laying the foundation for further work on cortex activity.	Semantic Scholar
Community Question Answering (CQA) has increasingly become an important service for people asking questions and providing answers online, which enables people to help each other by sharing knowledge.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, with accumulation of users and contents, much concern has arisen over the efficiency and answer quality of CQA services.	Semantic Scholar
To address this problem, question routing has been proposed which aims at routing new questions to suitable answerers, who have both high possibility and high ability to answer the questions.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we formulate question routing as a multi-objective ranking problem, and present a multi-objective learning-to-rank approach for question routing (MLQR), which can simultaneously optimize the answering possibility and answer quality of routed users.	Semantic Scholar
In MLQR, realizing that questions are relatively short and usually attached with tags, we first propose a tagword topic model (TTM) to derive topical representations of questions.	Semantic Scholar
Based on TTM, we then develop features for each question-user pair, which are captured at both platform level and thread level.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the platform-level features summarize the information of a user from his/her history posts in the CQA platform, while the thread-level features model the pairwise competitions of a user with others in his/her answered threads.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we extend a state-of-the-art learning-to-rank algorithm for training a multi-objective ranking model.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets show that our MLQR can outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of both answering possibility and answer quality.	Semantic Scholar
This paper addresses the problem of robot implicit force control by means of set invariance theory.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed control law improves the invariance control approach by avoiding the definition of a nominal stabilizing controller, while simultaneously ensuring the absence of output overshoots with respect to the reference.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting set invariance based controller is first introduced for a single-input single-output system and then extended to multi-input multi-output systems, in order to be applied to the robot implicit force control problem.	Semantic Scholar
Its effectiveness is experimentally validated and compared to state-of-the-art approaches on a hybrid force/position task performed with a 6 DOF industrial robot equipped with a force/torque sensor.	Semantic Scholar
Uncertain graphs are prevalent in several applications including communications systems, biological databases, and social networks.	Semantic Scholar
The ever increasing size of the underlying data renders both graph storage and query processing extremely expensive.	Semantic Scholar
Sparsification has often been used to reduce the size of deterministic graphs by maintaining only the important edges.	Semantic Scholar
However, adaptation of deterministic sparsification methods fails in the uncertain setting.	Semantic Scholar
To overcome this problem, we introduce the first sparsification techniques aimed explicitly at uncertain graphs.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed methods reduce the number of edges and redistribute their probabilities in order to decrease the graph size, while preserving its underlying structure.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting graph can be used to efficiently and accurately approximate any query and mining tasks on the original graph.	Semantic Scholar
An extensive experimental evaluation with real and synthetic datasets illustrates the effectiveness of our techniques on several common graph tasks, including clustering coefficient, page rank, reliability, and shortest path distance.	Semantic Scholar
Cortical area V4 lies in the middle of the visual pathway involved with object recognition.	Semantic Scholar
Neurons in V4 selectively respond to different curve fragments along the object contour.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a computational model that captures the shape features extracted by V4 neurons.	Semantic Scholar
The computational model emulated the information processing mechanism in the visual cortex.	Semantic Scholar
It extracted curve segments that V4 neurons respond to and quantitatively represented features of the curve segments.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed V4 shape features could describe object contours accurately and efficiently.	Semantic Scholar
With quantitative evaluation using the MPEG7 shape dataset, we showed that complex shapes could be represented with a very limited number of V4 shape features.	Semantic Scholar
Based on V4 features, we further developed a self-organizing map neural network to learn object shape models.	Semantic Scholar
The shape model was defined by a group of V4 features with constraints on their spatial relationships.	Semantic Scholar
The model was evaluated in object detection experiments using ETHZ objects and INRIA horses datasets.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed model could learn to recognize objects by shapes and accurately outline the object contour in the images.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, this model provides insight into the neural mechanisms of shape-based object recognition.	Semantic Scholar
Supervisory control environments, such as the NASA control room can induce high workload levels in situations where a single error is capable of costing millions of dollars.	Semantic Scholar
An intelligent system can improve human supervisor performance by monitoring the human's workload levels and intelligently adapting the system capabilities, such as adapting the interaction medium or reallocating roles and responsibilities between the human and the system.	Semantic Scholar
Systems capable of responding promptly and accurately to the human's changes in workload require a workload assessment algorithm that can detect changes to all components of workload in real time.	Semantic Scholar
A review of 24 workload assessment algorithms across six task domains is provided.	Semantic Scholar
Each algorithm is reviewed based on four criteria: sensitivity, diagnosticity, suitability, and generalizability.	Semantic Scholar
The majority of the reviewed algorithms were developed for a specific task domain and are unable to generalize different tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Further, the majority of the algorithms do not account for individual differences, only assess one or two workload components, and do not classify underload.	Semantic Scholar
We present a new teleoperated micromanipulation system in which all units of the system, wearable user interface devices and a slave micromanipulator, are manufactured by engraving, cutting, and folding two-dimensional materials.	Semantic Scholar
The designed manipulation system employs a simple hydraulic mechanism consisting of pairs of syringes that have different diameters, which allows for motion reduction and physical interaction between the master and the slave.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, users can precisely manipulate micro-objects without tremor, which was previously difficult with bare hands.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents design considerations and features fabrication methods, performance metrics of this creative manipulation system, and a range of high-level micromanipulation abilities such as pick-and-place, microseparation, and three-dimensional microassembly.	Semantic Scholar
Highlighting rapid design and fabrication of a low-cost precision micromanipulation system, this paper proposes new applications of folded machines to wearable robots and microrobotics.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a general framework to accelerate significantly the algorithms for nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF).	Semantic Scholar
This framework is inspired from the extrapolation scheme used to accelerate gradient methods in convex optimization and from the method of parallel tangents.	Semantic Scholar
However, the use of extrapolation in the context of the exact coordinate descent algorithms tackling the nonconvex NMF problems is novel.	Semantic Scholar
We illustrate the performance of this approach on two state-of-the-art NMF algorithms: accelerated hierarchical alternating least squares and alternating nonnegative least squares, using synthetic, image, and document data sets.	Semantic Scholar
Knee arthroscopy is a very challenging surgical procedure that would strongly benefit from systems that can continuously map the inside of the knee, localize the arthroscope and surgical tools, and control instruments using visual information.	Semantic Scholar
A fundamental requirement of most of these systems is the correct and fast matching of visual features.	Semantic Scholar
Feature-based systems have been demonstrated in laparoscopy but have yet to be extended to the context of arthroscopy.	Semantic Scholar
As an essential initial step, this letter proposes the first detailed experimental evaluation of the performance of state-of-the-art feature detection and description methods on arthroscopic images.	Semantic Scholar
We first evaluate the behavior of eight keypoint detectors under 133 setting combinations using four different metrics in a dataset with 100 in-vivo images.	Semantic Scholar
We then combine the previous detectors with six feature descriptors and evaluate the matching performance for the resulting features (detector+descriptor) across five different image transformations.	Semantic Scholar
A validation is performed using in-vivo images acquired under varying camera motion and illumination.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that the best-performing feature in knee-arthroscopy images is DoG+SIFT, while features BRISK+SURF and BRISK+BRISK are recommended for viable implementations in real time.	Semantic Scholar
Interaction with the world requires an organism to transform sensory signals into representations in which behaviorally meaningful properties of the environment are made explicit.	Semantic Scholar
These representations are derived through cascades of neuronal processing stages in which neurons at each stage recode the output of preceding stages.	Semantic Scholar
Explanations of sensory coding may thus involve understanding how low-level patterns are combined into more complex structures.	Semantic Scholar
To gain insight into such midlevel representations for sound, we designed a hierarchical generative model of natural sounds that learns combinations of spectrotemporal features from natural stimulus statistics.	Semantic Scholar
In the first layer, the model forms a sparse convolutional code of spectrograms using a dictionary of learned spectrotemporal kernels.	Semantic Scholar
To generalize from specific kernel activation patterns, the second layer encodes patterns of time-varying magnitude of multiple first-layer coefficients.	Semantic Scholar
When trained on corpora of speech and environmental sounds, some second-layer units learned to group similar spectrotemporal features.	Semantic Scholar
Others instantiate opponency between distinct sets of features.	Semantic Scholar
Such groupings might be instantiated by neurons in the auditory cortex, providing a hypothesis for midlevel neuronal computation.	Semantic Scholar
In recommender systems, one key task is to predict the personalized rating of a user to a new item and then return the new items having the top predicted ratings to the user.	Semantic Scholar
Recommender systems usually apply collaborative filtering techniques (e.g., matrix factorization) over a sparse user-item rating matrix to make rating prediction.	Semantic Scholar
However, the collaborative filtering techniques are severely affected by the data sparsity of the underlying user-item rating matrix and often confront the cold-start problems for new items and users.	Semantic Scholar
Since the attributes of items and social links between users become increasingly accessible in the Internet, this paper exploits the rich attributes of items and social links of users to alleviate the rating sparsity effect and tackle the cold-start problems.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we first propose a Kernel-based Attribute-aware M atrix Factorization model called KAMF to integrate the attribute information of items into matrix factorization.	Semantic Scholar
KAMF can discover the nonlinear interactions among attributes, users, and items, which mitigate the rating sparsity effect and deal with the cold-start problem for new items by nature.	Semantic Scholar
Further, we extend KAMF to address the cold-start problem for new users by utilizing the social links between users.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation for KAMF using two large-scale real-world data sets recently released in Yelp and MovieLens.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that KAMF achieves significantly superior performance against other state-of-the-art rating prediction techniques.	Semantic Scholar
We consider scenarios where several agents must aggregate their preferences over a large set of candidates with a combinatorial structure.	Semantic Scholar
That is, each candidate is an element of the Cartesian product of the domains of some variables (i.e., features).	Semantic Scholar
These scenarios are very common when candidates are described by feature vectors, such as cars, or houses, or any complex product.	Semantic Scholar
We assume agents to compactly express their preferences over the candidates via soft constraints.	Semantic Scholar
This is a compact way to model preferences which naturally models variables domains, and relationship among variables.	Semantic Scholar
To aggregate the preferences of the agents, we consider a sequential procedure that asks the agents to vote on one variable at a time.	Semantic Scholar
At each step, all agents express their preferences over the domain of a variable; based on such preferences, a voting rule is used to select one value for that variable.	Semantic Scholar
When all variables have been considered, the selected values constitute the returned variable assignment, that is, the elected candidate.	Semantic Scholar
We study several properties of this procedure (such as Condorcet consistency, anonymity, neutrality, monotonicity, consistency, efficiency, participation, independence of irrelevant alternatives, non dictatorship, and strategy-proofness), by relating them to corresponding properties of the adopted voting rules used for each variable.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we perform an experimental study on a special kind of soft constraints, namely fuzzy constraints.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental study shows that the proposed sequential procedure yields a considerable saving in time with respect to a non-sequential approach, while the winners satisfy the agents just as well, independently of the variable ordering, and of the presence of coalitions of agents.	Semantic Scholar
Recent work in computer science has shown the power of deep learning driven by the backpropagation algorithm in networks of artificial neurons.	Semantic Scholar
But real neurons in the brain are different from most of these artificial ones in at least three crucial ways: they emit spikes rather than graded outputs, their inputs and outputs are related dynamically rather than by piecewise-smooth functions, and they have no known way to coordinate arrays of synapses in separate forward and feedback pathways so that they change simultaneously and identically, as they do in backpropagation.	Semantic Scholar
Given these differences, it is unlikely that current deep learning algorithms can operate in the brain, but we that show these problems can be solved by two simple devices: learning rules can approximate dynamic input-output relations with piecewise-smooth functions, and a variation on the feedback alignment algorithm can train deep networks without having to coordinate forward and feedback synapses.	Semantic Scholar
Our results also show that deep spiking networks learn much better if each neuron computes an intracellular teaching signal that reflects that cell’s nonlinearity.	Semantic Scholar
With this mechanism, networks of spiking neurons show useful learning in synapses at least nine layers upstream from the output cells and perform well compared to other spiking networks in the literature on the MNIST digit recognition task.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, graph-based unsupervised feature selection algorithms (GUFS) have been shown to efficiently handle prevalent high-dimensional unlabeled data.	Semantic Scholar
One common drawback associated with existing graph-based approaches is that they tend to be time-consuming and in need of large storage, especially when faced with the increasing size of data.	Semantic Scholar
Research has started using anchors to accelerate graph-based learning model for feature selection, while the hard linear constraint between the data matrix and the lower-dimensional representation is usually overstrict in many applications.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a flexible linearization model with anchor graph and ℓ21-norm regularization, which can deal with large-scale data sets and improve the performance of the existing anchor-based method.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the anchor-based graph Laplacian is constructed to characterize the manifold embedding structure by means of a parameter-free adaptive neighbor assignment strategy.	Semantic Scholar
An efficient iterative algorithm is developed to address the optimization problem, and we also prove the convergence of the algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on several public data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the method we propose.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a novel approach to learning of relations among motions, objects, and language, and to generating sentences that describe human actions.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach categorizes human motions and the objects acted on those motions, and subsequently integrates the motion categories and object categories with their descriptive sentences.	Semantic Scholar
The integration consists of two steps.	Semantic Scholar
The first step stochastically learns the relations among the motions, objects, and words in the sentences.	Semantic Scholar
The second step stochastically learns the order of words in the sentences as the sentence structures.	Semantic Scholar
The model derived in the first step is referred to as “action language” model and that derived in the second step as “natural language” model.	Semantic Scholar
This framework for integrating an action language model with a natural language model can be applied to generating descriptive sentences from human actions, where each action is recognized as a pair containing a motion category and an object category, the words relevant to the action are generated via the contained motion and object categories, and the words to be arranged result in a descriptive sentence.	Semantic Scholar
More theoretically, our approach searches for multiple words likely to be generated from the motion and object categories by using the action language model; and subsequently searches for a sequence of these words that is likely to be generated from the obtained words, using the natural language model.	Semantic Scholar
We tested our proposed approach for sentence generation by applying it to human action data captured by an RGB-D sensor, and demonstrated its validity.	Semantic Scholar
Untethered magnetic navigation of millirobots within a human body using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner is a promising technology for minimally invasive surgery or drug delivery.	Semantic Scholar
Because MRI scanners have a large static magnetic field, they cannot generate torque on magnetic millirobots and must instead use gradient-based pulling.	Semantic Scholar
However, gradient values are too small to produce forces large enough to penetrate tissue.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a method to produce large pulsed forces on millirobots.	Semantic Scholar
A ferromagnetic sphere is placed inside a hollow robot body and can move back and forth.	Semantic Scholar
This movement is created by alternating the magnetic gradient direction.	Semantic Scholar
On the posterior side, a spring allows the sphere to change direction smoothly.	Semantic Scholar
On the anterior side, a hard rod creates a surface for the sphere to impact.	Semantic Scholar
This impact results in a large pulsed force.	Semantic Scholar
The purpose of this study was to understand the functioning of magnetic hammer actuation and control, as well as demonstrate the viability of this mechanism for tissue penetration.	Semantic Scholar
This letter begins with modeling and simulating this system.	Semantic Scholar
Next, different control strategies are presented and tested.	Semantic Scholar
The system successfully penetrated lamb brain samples.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, preliminary tests inside a clinical MRI scanner demonstrate the potential of this actuation system.	Semantic Scholar
This paper reports on a model-based control strategy for miniature legged robots tasked with navigation in cluttered environments.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach uses a new model for crawling locomotion to derive closed-form expressions of state propagation.	Semantic Scholar
The latter enable the development of a feedback control navigation strategy.	Semantic Scholar
The strategy consists of a waypoint tracking controller that steers the system along desired paths and an outer control loop that updates the reference path to account for uncertainty.	Semantic Scholar
This strategy allows noise-resilient navigation for miniature legged robots and is experimentally validated on an eight-legged robot that navigates in obstacle-cluttered environments.	Semantic Scholar
Graph-based algorithms have been successfully applied in machine learning and data mining tasks.	Semantic Scholar
A simple but, widely used, approach to build graphs from vector-based data is to consider each data instance as a vertex and connecting pairs of it using a similarity measure.	Semantic Scholar
Although this abstraction presents some advantages, such as arbitrary shape representation of the original data, it is still tied to some drawbacks, for example, it is dependent on the choice of a pre-defined distance metric and is biased by the local information among data instances.	Semantic Scholar
Aiming at exploring alternative ways to build graphs from data, this paper proposes an algorithm for constructing a new type of graph, called Attribute-based Decision Graph-AbDG.	Semantic Scholar
Given a vector-based data set, an AbDG is built by partitioning each data attribute range into disjoint intervals and representing each interval as a vertex.	Semantic Scholar
The edges are then established between vertices from different attributes according to a pre-defined pattern.	Semantic Scholar
Classification is performed through a matching process among the attribute values of the new instance and AbDG.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, AbDG provides an inner mechanism to handle missing attribute values, which contributes for expanding its applicability.	Semantic Scholar
Results of classification tasks have shown that AbDG is a competitive approach when compared to well-known multiclass algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
The main contribution of the proposed framework is the combination of the advantages of attribute-based and graph-based techniques to perform robust pattern matching data classification, while permitting the analysis the input data considering only a subset of its attributes.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel semi-direct approach for monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) that combines the complementary strengths of direct and feature-based methods.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed pipeline loosely couples direct odometry and feature-based SLAM to perform three levels of parallel optimizations: 1) photometric bundle adjustment (BA) that jointly optimizes the local structure and motion, 2) geometric BA that refines keyframe poses and associated feature map points, and 3) pose graph optimization to achieve global map consistency in the presence of loop closures.	Semantic Scholar
This is achieved in real-time by limiting the feature-based operations to marginalized keyframes from the direct odometry module.	Semantic Scholar
Exhaustive evaluation on two benchmark datasets demonstrates that our system outperforms the state-of-the-art monocular odometry and SLAM systems in terms of overall accuracy and robustness.	Semantic Scholar
The proliferation of heterogeneous Linked Data on the Web poses new challenges to database systems.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the capacity to store, track, and query provenance data is becoming a pivotal feature of modern triplestores.	Semantic Scholar
We present methods extending a native RDF store to efficiently handle the storage, tracking, and querying of provenance in RDF data.	Semantic Scholar
We describe a reliable and understandable specification of the way results were derived from the data and how particular pieces of data were combined to answer a query.	Semantic Scholar
Subsequently, we present techniques to tailor queries with provenance data.	Semantic Scholar
We empirically evaluate the presented methods and show that the overhead of storing and tracking provenance is acceptable.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we show that tailoring a query with provenance information can also significantly improve the performance of query execution.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a method to estimate the six-degree-of-freedom pose of a magnetic capsule, with an embedded permanent magnet and Hall-effect sensors, using a rotating dipole field.	Semantic Scholar
The method's convergence properties as a function of the number of distinct rotation axes of the applied field and the number of complete rotations about each axis are characterized.	Semantic Scholar
Across our tested workspace, the localization error was 4.9 ± 2.7 mm and 3.3 ± 1.7 degrees (mean ± standard deviation).	Semantic Scholar
We experimentally demonstrate this is sufficient for propulsion of a screw-type magnetic capsule through a lumen using a single dipole to both propel and localize the capsule.	Semantic Scholar
Designing an actuator system for highly dynamic legged robots has been one of the grand challenges in robotics research.	Semantic Scholar
Conventional actuators for manufacturing applications have difficulty satisfying design requirements for high-speed locomotion, such as the need for high torque density and the ability to manage dynamic physical interactions.	Semantic Scholar
To address this challenge, this paper suggests a proprioceptive actuation paradigm that enables highly dynamic performance in legged machines.	Semantic Scholar
Proprioceptive actuation uses collocated force control at the joints to effectively control contact interactions at the feet under dynamic conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Modal analysis of a reduced leg model and dimensional analysis of DC motors address the main principles for implementation of this paradigm.	Semantic Scholar
In the realm of legged machines, this paradigm provides a unique combination of high torque density, high-bandwidth force control, and the ability to mitigate impacts through backdrivability.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce a new metric named the “impact mitigation factor” (IMF) to quantify backdrivability at impact, which enables design comparison across a wide class of robots.	Semantic Scholar
The MIT Cheetah leg is presented, and is shown to have an IMF that is comparable to other quadrupeds with series springs to handle impact.	Semantic Scholar
The design enables the Cheetah to control contact forces during dynamic bounding, with contact times down to 85 ms and peak forces over 450 N. The unique capabilities of the MIT Cheetah, achieving impact-robust force-controlled operation in high-speed three-dimensional running and jumping, suggest wider implementation of this holistic actuation approach.	Semantic Scholar
The choice of kernel has an important effect on the performance of a support vector machine (SVM).	Semantic Scholar
The effect could be reduced by NEUROSVM, an architecture using multilayer perceptron for feature extraction and SVM for classification.	Semantic Scholar
In binary classification, a general linear kernel NEUROSVM can be theoretically simplified as an input layer, many hidden layers, and an SVM output layer.	Semantic Scholar
As a feature extractor, the sub-network composed of the input and hidden layers is first trained together with a virtual ordinary output layer by backpropagation, then with the output of its last hidden layer taken as input of the SVM classifier for further training separately.	Semantic Scholar
By taking the sub-network as a kernel mapping from the original input space into a feature space, we present a novel model, called deep neural mapping support vector machine (DNMSVM), from the viewpoint of deep learning.	Semantic Scholar
This model is also a new and general kernel learning method, where the kernel mapping is indeed an explicit function expressed as a sub-network, different from an implicit function induced by a kernel function traditionally.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we exploit a two-stage procedure of contrastive divergence learning and gradient descent for DNMSVM to jointly training an adaptive kernel mapping instead of a kernel function, without requirement of kernel tricks.	Semantic Scholar
As a whole of the sub-network and the SVM classifier, the joint training of DNMSVM is done by using gradient descent to optimize the objective function with the sub-network layer-wise pre-trained via contrastive divergence learning of restricted Boltzmann machines.	Semantic Scholar
Compared to the separate training of NEUROSVM, the joint training is a new algorithm for DNMSVM to have advantages over NEUROSVM.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that DNMSVM can outperform NEUROSVM and RBFSVM (i.e., SVM with the kernel of radial basis function), demonstrating its effectiveness.	Semantic Scholar
Industry 4.0 paves the way to smart factory through integrating Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems, cloud manufacturing, and big data analytics for various industrial fields.	Semantic Scholar
Especially, the machinery industry significantly benefits from these automation techniques in machine-tool quality inspection, cutting-tool remaining-useful-life, surface roughness prediction, etc.	Semantic Scholar
However, these innovation technologies are still not executable in the aerospace-component production due to their complex machining conditions, which result in long metrology delays and severe component deformations.	Semantic Scholar
To overcome these two challenges of the aerospace industry, this letter proposes to apply the automatic virtual metrology (AVM) system to successfully convert sampling inspections with metrology delay into real-time and online total inspection and to utilize the so-called deformation fusion (DF) scheme for dealing with the component-deformation problem.

The application of the flange operation of aerospace engine-case manufacturing is adopted to illustrate the performance of the AVM-plus-DF approach.	Semantic Scholar

Head drop is a symptom commonly seen in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	Semantic Scholar
These patients usually experience neck pain and have difficulty in swallowing and breathing.	Semantic Scholar
Static neck braces are used in current treatment.	Semantic Scholar
These braces, however, immobilize the head in a single configuration, which causes muscle atrophy.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents the design of a dynamic neck brace for the first time in the literature, which can both measure and potentially assist in the head motion of the human user.	Semantic Scholar
This letter introduces the brace design method and validates its capability to perform measurements.	Semantic Scholar
The brace is designed based on kinematics data collected from a healthy individual via a motion capture system.	Semantic Scholar
A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the wearability of the brace and the accuracy of measurements with the brace.	Semantic Scholar
This study recruited ten participants who performed a series of head motions.	Semantic Scholar
The results of this human study indicate that the brace is wearable by individuals who vary in size, the brace allows nearly $70\%$ of the overall range of head rotations, and the sensors on the brace give accurate motion of the head with an error of under  $5^{\circ }$ when compared to a motion capture system.	Semantic Scholar
We believe that this neck brace can be a valid and accurate measurement tool for human head motion.	Semantic Scholar
This brace will be a big improvement in the available technologies to measure head motion as these are currently done in the clinic using hand-held protractors in two orthogonal planes.	Semantic Scholar

Among these, visual data takes a prominent role given the large nd pervasive diffusion of imaging devices in our cities, industries, t home, and in our hands given the plenitude of personal deices such as smart phones at our disposal.	Semantic Scholar
For the latter, one can ppreciate readily the scale of the data consumed just by thinkng about the amount of image and video data downloaded evry minute in social media such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, mong others.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, visual data is by large the most diverse nd demanding media, as compared to text for instance, growing t an unprecedented speed.	Semantic Scholar
This requires the design of effective ethods to manage it, by mining relevant information while disarding redundant or useless data.	Semantic Scholar
To that end, more scalable and obust methods are required to efficiently index, retrieve, organize, nterpret and interact with such big visual data, and this cannot be one without automatic or semi-automatic, e.g.	Semantic Scholar

In this context, it is clear that big visual data analysis and unerstanding impose significant scientific and technological chalenges since one not only should have to advance methods able to racefully scale to both big and diverse data whilst being computaionally cheap, but also should need to develop processes suitable or learning from big and diverse data without incurring prohibitive osts in human and monetary resources, and of time, required y exhaustive data annotation.

Moreover, efficient online learning ethods could be required to cope with data acquired over time.	Semantic Scholar
Manual control cybernetics aims to understand and describe how humans control vehicles and devices using mathematical models of human control dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
This “cybernetic approach” enables objective and quantitative comparisons of human behavior, and allows a systematic optimization of human control interfaces and training associated with manual control.	Semantic Scholar
Current cybernetics theory is primarily based on technology and analysis methods formalized in the 1960s and has shown to be limited in its capability to capture the full breadth of human cognition and control.	Semantic Scholar
This paper reviews the current state-of-the-art in our knowledge of human manual control, points out the main fundamental limitations in cybernetics, and proposes a possible roadmap to advance the theory and its applications.	Semantic Scholar
Central in this roadmap will be a shift from the current linear time-invariant modeling approach that is only truly valid for human behavior under tightly controlled and stationary conditions, to methods that facilitate the analysis of adaptive, and possibly time-varying, human behavior in realistic control tasks.

Examples of key current developments in the field of cybernetics—human use of preview, predictable discrete maneuvering, skill acquisition and training, time-varying human modeling, and neuromuscular system modeling—that contribute to this shift are presented in this paper.	Semantic Scholar

Human–machine collaborative manufacturing systems consist of human operators and automated machines.	Semantic Scholar
They cooperate with each other to accomplish complex tasks that are difficult for either the human or machine alone.	Semantic Scholar
This letter considers an optimal task-allocation problem for human–machine collaborative manufacturing systems, where various tasks are dispatched to human operators and automated machines to achieve optimal joint human-system performance.	Semantic Scholar
Designing such optimal task allocation is challenging because of the stochastic hybrid feature of manufacturing processes, as well as varying human performance caused by physical fatigue.	Semantic Scholar
To address this challenge, we first model human fatigue as a continuous-time Markov decision process, which is capable of capturing stochastic uncertainties on fatigue dynamics under different task assignments.	Semantic Scholar
A novel controlled stochastic petri net is then proposed to model the manufacturing process, in which both time- and event-driven dynamics can be regulated by task allocation between the human and machine.	Semantic Scholar
Under mild assumptions, we show that the optimal task-allocation problem under the proposed human manufacturing framework can be solved by linear programming.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation results of a four-part assembly process are used to verify our theoretical findings.	Semantic Scholar

The proposed method is first analyzed and refined on a controlled scenario and then it is experimentally assessed on challenging real-world tasks.	Semantic Scholar
The achieved results also show the ability of properly designed DeepESNs to outperform RC approaches on a speech recognition task, and to compete with the state-of-the-art in time-series prediction on polyphonic music tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Global registration of multiview robot data is a challenging task.	Semantic Scholar

This paper talks about the stability and synchronization problems of fractional-order quaternion-valued neural networks (FQVNNs) with linear threshold neurons.	Semantic Scholar
On account of the non-commutativity of quaternion multiplication resulting from Hamilton rules, the FQVNN models are separated into four real-valued neural network (RVNN) models.	Semantic Scholar
Consequently, the dynamic analysis of FQVNNs can be realized by investigating the real-valued ones.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the method of M-matrix, the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium point of the FQVNNs are obtained without detailed proof.	Semantic Scholar
Afterwards, several sufficient criteria ensuring the global Mittag-Leffler stability for the unique equilibrium point of the FQVNNs are derived by applying the Lyapunov direct method, the theory of fractional differential equation, the theory of matrix eigenvalue, and some inequality techniques.

In the meanwhile, global Mittag-Leffler synchronization for the drive-response models of the addressed FQVNNs are investigated explicitly.	Semantic Scholar

In this letter, we present a novel wearable feedback interface with the aim to improve human ergonomics in the execution of heavy or repetitive industrial tasks.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed interface incorporates a reduced-complexity and real-time model for the estimation of human joints’ load variations, based on the estimated translational displacement of the center of pressure in the presence of external forces and loads.	Semantic Scholar
Wireless vibrotactile displays are then developed to inform humans about excessive overloading of body joints by applying appropriate tactile stimuli, and to guide them towards more ergonomic and suitable physical loading conditions.	Semantic Scholar
We validated our framework by a user study during which the subjects while performing a heavy object lifting task, reconfigured the body pose to minimize the overloading efforts.	Semantic Scholar
This was achieved by following the vibrotactile feedback guidance, provided by wearable tactile devices.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results include a statistical analysis of ten subjects that demonstrate the potential of the proposed method in assisting human workers.	Semantic Scholar

Mobile robots build on accurate, real-time mapping with onboard range sensors to achieve autonomous navigation over rough terrain.	Semantic Scholar
Existing approaches often rely on absolute localization based on tracking of external geometric or visual features.	Semantic Scholar
To circumvent the reliability issues of these approaches, we propose a novel terrain mapping method, which bases on proprioceptive localization from kinematic and inertial measurements only.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method incorporates the drift and uncertainties of the state estimation and a noise model of the distance sensor.	Semantic Scholar
It yields a probabilistic terrain estimate as a grid-based elevation map including upper and lower confidence bounds.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with simulated datasets and real-world experiments for real-time terrain mapping with legged robots and compare the terrain reconstruction to ground truth reference maps.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a method for intrinsic dimension estimation.	Semantic Scholar
By fitting the power of distance from an inspection point and the number of samples included inside a ball with a radius equal to the distance, to a regression model, we estimate the goodness of fit.	Semantic Scholar
Then, by using the maximum likelihood method, we estimate the local intrinsic dimension around the inspection point.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method is shown to be comparable to conventional methods in global intrinsic dimension estimation experiments.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we experimentally show that the proposed method outperforms a conventional local dimension estimation method.	Semantic Scholar
Various robotic grippers have been developed over the past several decades for robotic manipulators.	Semantic Scholar
Especially, the soft grippers based on the soft pneumatic actuator (SPA) have been studied actively, since it offers more pliable bending motion, inherent compliance, and a simple morphological structure.	Semantic Scholar
However, few studies have focused on simultaneously improving the fingertip force and actuation speed within the specified design parameters.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we developed a hybrid gripper that incorporates both soft and rigid components to improve the fingertip force and actuation speed simultaneously based on three design principles: first, the degree of bending is proportional to the ratio of the rigid structure; second, a concave chamber design is preferred for large longitudinal strain; and third, a round shape between soft and rigid materials increases the fingertip force.	Semantic Scholar
The suggested principles were verified using the finite element methods.	Semantic Scholar
The improved performance of the hybrid gripper was verified experimentally and compared with the performance of a conventional SPAs.	Semantic Scholar
The ability of the hybrid gripper to grasp different objects was evaluated and was applied in a teleoperated system.	Semantic Scholar
An appealing new principle for neural population codes is that correlations among neurons organize neural activity patterns into a discrete set of clusters, which can each be viewed as a noise-robust population codeword.	Semantic Scholar
Previous studies assumed that these codewords corresponded geometrically with local peaks in the probability landscape of neural population responses.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we analyze multiple data sets of the responses of approximately 150 retinal ganglion cells and show that local probability peaks are absent under broad, nonrepeated stimulus ensembles, which are characteristic of natural behavior.	Semantic Scholar
However, we find that neural activity still forms noise-robust clusters in this regime, albeit clusters with a different geometry.	Semantic Scholar
We start by defining a soft local maximum, which is a local probability maximum when constrained to a fixed spike count.	Semantic Scholar
Next, we show that soft local maxima are robustly present and can, moreover, be linked across different spike count levels in the probability landscape to form a ridge.	Semantic Scholar
We found that these ridges comprise combinations of spiking and silence in the neural population such that all of the spiking neurons are members of the same neuronal community, a notion from network theory.	Semantic Scholar
We argue that a neuronal community shares many of the properties of Donald Hebb's classic cell assembly and show that a simple, biologically plausible decoding algorithm can recognize the presence of a specific neuronal community.	Semantic Scholar
This work proposes a novel and improved delay independent global asymptotic stability criterion for delayed Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy Cohen-Grossberg neural networks exploiting a suitable fuzzy-type Lyapunov functional in the presence of the nondecreasing activation functions having bounded slopes.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed stability criterion can be easily validated as it is completely expressed in terms of the system matrices of the fuzzy neural network model considered.	Semantic Scholar
It will be shown that the stability criterion obtained in this work for this type of fuzzy neural networks improves and generalizes some of the previously published stability results.	Semantic Scholar
A constructive numerical example is also given to support the proposed theoretical results.	Semantic Scholar
One of the most serious disadvantages of the vertical takeoff and landing flying robots including multicopters is the necessity of the flat stable area for safe landing.	Semantic Scholar
The ability to land and takeoff from uneven surfaces and moving basements would help the rotorcrafts in many important applications.	Semantic Scholar
The special landing gears are used to provide rotorcrafts this ability.	Semantic Scholar
This letter explores multicopter landing on uneven surfaces using a novel adaptive landing platform DroneGear.	Semantic Scholar
The DroneGear contains four compliant robotic legs of two degrees of freedom each.	Semantic Scholar
The innovative optical torque sensor is integrated into the knee joint of each leg to provide timely adaptation to rough terrain in an unknown environment.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, inertial measurement unit is embedded into the passive footpad of each leg for estimation of relief profile in the landing zone.	Semantic Scholar
The results of the experiments show that the DroneGear can be successfully used for the safe hexacopter landing on the different angle slopes, plane, step surfaces, and for terrain profile estimation as well.	Semantic Scholar
Soft sensors made of highly deformable materials are one of the enabling technologies to various soft robotic systems, such as soft mobile robots, soft wearable robots, and soft grippers.	Semantic Scholar
However, major drawbacks of soft sensors compared with traditional sensors are their nonlinearity and hysteresis in response, which are common especially in microfluidic soft sensors.	Semantic Scholar
In this research, we propose to address the above issues of soft sensors by taking advantage of deep learning.	Semantic Scholar
We implemented a hierarchical recurrent sensing network, a type of recurrent neural network model, to the calibration of soft sensors for estimating the magnitude and the location of a contact pressure simultaneously.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach in this letter is not only able to model the nonlinear characteristic with hysteresis of the pressure response, but also find the location of the pressure.	Semantic Scholar
Disjunctive Temporal Problems (DTPs) with Preferences (DTPPs) extend DTPs with piece-wise constant preference functions associated to each constraint of the form l ≤ x − y ≤ u, where x,y are (real or integer) variables, and l,u are numeric constants.	Semantic Scholar
The goal is to find an assignment to the variables of the problem that maximizes the sum of the preference values of satisfied DTP constraints, where such values are obtained by aggregating the preference functions of the satisfied constraints in it under a “max” semantic.	Semantic Scholar
The state-of-the-art approach in the field, implemented in the native DTPP solver Maxilitis, extends the approach of the native DTP solver Epilitis.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we present alternative approaches that translate DTPPs to Maximum Satisfiability of a set of Boolean combination of constraints of the form l⋈x − y⋈u, ⋈ ∈{<,≤}, that extend previous work dealing with constant preference functions only.	Semantic Scholar
We prove correctness and completeness of the approaches.	Semantic Scholar
Results obtained with the Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers Yices and MathSAT on randomly generated DTPPs and DTPPs built from real-world benchmarks, show that one of our translation is competitive to, and can be faster than, Maxilitis (This is an extended and revised version of Bourguet et al.

The complex, nonintuitive kinematics of concentric tube robots (CTRs) can make their telemanipulation challenging.	Semantic Scholar
Collaborative control schemes that guide the operating clinician via repulsive and attractive force feedback based on intraoperative path planning can simplify this task.	Semantic Scholar
Computationally efficient algorithms, however, are required to perform rapid path planning and solve the inverse kinematics of the robot at interactive rates.	Semantic Scholar
Until now, ensuring stable and collisionfree robot configurations required long periods of precomputation to establish kinematic look-up tables.	Semantic Scholar
This article presents a high-performance robot kinematics software architecture, which is used together with a multinode computational framework to rapidly calculate dense path plans for safe telemanipulation of unstable CTRs.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed software architecture enables on-the-fly, incremental, inverse-kinematics estimation at interactive rates, and it is tailored to modern computing architectures with efficient multicore central processing units (CPUs).	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness of the architecture is quantified with computational-complexity metrics and a clinically demanding simulation inspired from neurosurgery for hydrocephalus treatment.	Semantic Scholar
By achieving real-time path planning, active constraints (ACs) can get generated on the fly and support the operator in faster and more reliable execution of telemanipulation tasks.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we have implemented and compared two neural coding algorithms in the networks of spiking neurons: Winner-takes-all (WTA) and winners-share-all (WSA).	Semantic Scholar
Winners-Share-All exploits the code space provided by the temporal code by training a different combination of out of neurons to fire together in response to different patterns, while WTA uses a one-hot-coding to respond to distinguished patterns.	Semantic Scholar
Using WSA, the maximum value of in order to maximize information capacity using output neurons was theoretically determined and utilized.	Semantic Scholar
A small proof-of-concept classification problem was applied to a spiking neural network using both algorithms to classify 14 letters of English alphabet with an image size of 15 15 pixels.	Semantic Scholar
For both schemes, a modified spike-timing-dependent-plasticity (STDP) learning rule has been used to train the spiking neurons in an unsupervised fashion.	Semantic Scholar
The performance and the number of neurons required to perform this computation are compared between the two algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
We show that by tolerating a small drop in performance accuracy (84% in WSA versus 91% in WTA), we are able to reduce the number of output neurons by more than a factor of two.	Semantic Scholar
We show how the reduction in the number of neurons will increase as the number of patterns increases.	Semantic Scholar
The reduction in the number of output neurons would then proportionally reduce the number of training parameters, which requires less memory and hence speeds up the computation, and in the case of neuromorphic implementation on silicon, would take up much less area.	Semantic Scholar
In recent years, the development of algorithms to detect neuronal spiking activity from two-photon calcium imaging data has received much attention, yet few researchers have examined the metrics used to assess the similarity of detected spike trains with the ground truth.	Semantic Scholar
We highlight the limitations of the two most commonly used metrics, the spike train correlation and success rate, and propose an alternative, which we refer to as CosMIC.	Semantic Scholar
Rather than operating on the true and estimated spike trains directly, the proposed metric assesses the similarity of the pulse trains obtained from convolution of the spike trains with a smoothing pulse.	Semantic Scholar
The pulse width, which is derived from the statistics of the imaging data, reflects the temporal tolerance of the metric.	Semantic Scholar
The final metric score is the size of the commonalities of the pulse trains as a fraction of their average size.	Semantic Scholar
Viewed through the lens of set theory, CosMIC resembles a continuous Sørensen-Dice coefficient—an index commonly used to assess the similarity of discrete, presence/absence data.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the ability of the proposed metric to discriminate the precision and recall of spike train estimates.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike the spike train correlation, which appears to reward overestimation, the proposed metric score is maximized when the correct number of spikes have been detected.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we show that CosMIC is more sensitive to the temporal precision of estimates than the success rate.	Semantic Scholar
This paper discusses the nonholonomic robotic systems whose motion constraints assume the Pfaffian form, and the equations of motion are represented by driftless control systems with outputs.	Semantic Scholar
By reference to the end point map of such a control system, we define the system's Jacobian and study Jacobian motion-planning algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
A new Lagrange-type Jacobian inverse, referred to as the General Lagrangian Jacobian Inverse (GLJI), is designed as the solution of an optimal control problem with a Lagrange-type objective function.	Semantic Scholar
Singularities of GLJI are examined.	Semantic Scholar
A special choice of the objective function illustrates features of GLJI.	Semantic Scholar
A new motion-planning algorithm based on GLJI is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
Theoretical arguments are illustrated with a motion-planning problem of a space robot.	Semantic Scholar
Aspect-based opinion mining is finding elaborate opinions towards a subject such as a product or an event.	Semantic Scholar
With explosive growth of opinionated texts on the Web, mining aspect-level opinions has become a promising means for online public opinion analysis.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the boom of various types of online media provides diverse yet complementary information, bringing unprecedented opportunities for cross media aspect-opinion mining.	Semantic Scholar
Along this line, we propose CAMEL, a novel topic model for complementary aspect-based opinion mining across asymmetric collections.	Semantic Scholar
CAMEL gains information complementarity by modeling both common and specific aspects across collections, while keeping all the corresponding opinions for contrastive study.	Semantic Scholar
An auto-labeling scheme called AME is also proposed to help discriminate between aspect and opinion words without elaborative human labeling, which is further enhanced by adding word embedding-based similarity as a new feature.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, CAMEL-DP, a nonparametric alternative to CAMEL is also proposed based on coupled Dirichlet Processes.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on real-world multi-collection reviews data demonstrate the superiority of our methods to competitive baselines.	Semantic Scholar
This is particularly true when the information shared by different collections becomes seriously fragmented.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, a case study on the public event “2014 Shanghai Stampede” demonstrates the practical value of CAMEL for real-world applications.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, generalized pinning synchronization problem is investigated for a class of Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with discontinuous neuron activations and mixed delays.	Semantic Scholar
By designing generalized pinning state-feedback and adaptive controllers, several criteria for global exponential synchronization and global asymptotical synchronization of the drive-response based system are obtained in view of non-smooth analysis theory with generalized Lyapunov functional method, in which first pinning the neurons with very small self-inhibition and small amplification functions is pointed out.

Some numerical examples are given to illustrate the feasibility of the obtained results.	Semantic Scholar
This work introduces a novel approach to the solution of the navigation problem by mapping an obstacle-cluttered environment to a trivial domain called the point world, where the navigation task is reduced to connecting the images of the initial and destination configurations by a straight line.	Semantic Scholar
Due to this effect, the underlying transformation is termed the “navigation transformation.” The properties of the navigation transformation are studied in this work as well as its capability to provide—through the proposed feedback controller designs—solutions to the motion- and path-planning problems.	Semantic Scholar
Notably, the proposed approach enables the construction of temporal stabilization controllers as detailed herein, which provide a time abstraction to the navigation problem.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed solutions are correct by construction and, given a diffeomorphism from the workspace to a sphere world, tuning free.	Semantic Scholar
A candidate construction for the navigation transformation on sphere worlds is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
The provided theoretical results are backed by analytical proofs.	Semantic Scholar
The efficiency, robustness, and applicability of the proposed solutions are supported by a series of experimental case studies.	Semantic Scholar

Blockchain technologies are gaining massive momentum in the last few years.	Semantic Scholar
Blockchains are distributed ledgers that enable parties who do not fully trust each other to maintain a set of global states.	Semantic Scholar
The parties agree on the existence, values, and histories of the states.	Semantic Scholar
As the technology landscape is expanding rapidly, it is both important and challenging to have a firm grasp of what the core technologies have to offer, especially with respect to their data processing capabilities.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we first survey the state of the art, focusing on private blockchains (in which parties are authenticated).	Semantic Scholar
We analyze both in-production and research systems in four dimensions: distributed ledger, cryptography, consensus protocol, and smart contract.	Semantic Scholar
We then present BLOCKBENCH, a benchmarking framework for understanding performance of private blockchains against data processing workloads.	Semantic Scholar
We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of three major blockchain systems based on BLOCKBENCH, namely Ethereum, Parity, and Hyperledger Fabric.	Semantic Scholar
The results demonstrate several trade-offs in the design space, as well as big performance gaps between blockchain and database systems.	Semantic Scholar
Drawing from design principles of database systems, we discuss several research directions for bringing blockchain performance closer to the realm of databases.	Semantic Scholar
The Mobile Pass project focused its efforts on developing a technologically advanced mobile equipment for land border crossing points.	Semantic Scholar
During the project execution, a mobile device supporting biometric recognition (face and fingerprint) and passport checking was designed and developed.	Semantic Scholar
To test this new equipment under an operational environment, a usability evaluation was carried out in the Sculeni border control (border of Romania with Moldavia), being the operators Romanian Policemen and the data subjects' real volunteer travelers.	Semantic Scholar
The equipment was used for 2 days under different conditions in real scenarios, and the usability evaluation carried out follows the ISO 9241-11:1998 standard.	Semantic Scholar
A total of 93 participants completed the new border checking and fulfilled a satisfaction survey at the end of the experiment.	Semantic Scholar
This paper describes the evaluation and reports some preliminary results on the user-Automatic Border Control system interaction and the final conclusions obtained at the end of the project, resulting in a valuable guide for designing user interaction in security areas.	Semantic Scholar
Over-constrained problems are ubiquitous in real-world decision and optimization problems.	Semantic Scholar
Plenty of modeling formalisms for various problem domains involving soft constraints have been proposed, such as weighted, fuzzy, or probabilistic constraints.	Semantic Scholar
All of them were shown to be instances of algebraic structures.	Semantic Scholar
In terms of modeling languages, however, the field of soft constraints lags behind the state of the art in classical constraint optimization.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce MiniBrass, a versatile soft constraint modeling language building on the unifying algebraic framework of partially ordered valuation structures (PVS) that is implemented as an extension of MiniZinc and MiniSearch.	Semantic Scholar
We first demonstrate the adequacy of PVS to naturally augment partial orders with a combination operation as used in soft constraints.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we provide the most general construction of a c-semiring from an arbitrary PVS.	Semantic Scholar
Both arguments draw upon elements from category theory.	Semantic Scholar
MiniBrass turns these theoretical considerations into practice: It offers a generic extensible PVS type system, reusable implementations of specific soft constraint formalisms as PVS types, operators for complex PVS products, and morphisms to transform PVS.	Semantic Scholar
MiniBrass models are compiled into MiniZinc to benefit from the wide range of solvers supporting FlatZinc.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluated MiniBrass on 28 “softened” MiniZinc benchmark problems with six different solvers.	Semantic Scholar
The results demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.	Semantic Scholar
We consider the problem of cooperative localization (CL) via interrobot measurements for a team of networked robots with limited on-board resources.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel algorithm in which each robot localizes itself in a global coordinate frame by local dead reckoning, and opportunistically corrects its pose estimate whenever it receives a relative measurement update message from a server.	Semantic Scholar
The computation and storage cost per robot in terms of the size of the team is of order $O(1)$, and the robots are only transmitting information when they are involved in a relative measurement.	Semantic Scholar
The server also only needs to compute and transmit update messages when it receives an interrobot measurement.	Semantic Scholar
Under perfect communication, our algorithm is an alternative implementation of a joint CL for the team via an extended Kalman filter.	Semantic Scholar
However, perfect communication is not a hard constraint.	Semantic Scholar
We show that our algorithm is robust to communication failures, with formal guarantees that the updated estimates of the robots receiving the update message are of minimum variance in a first-order approximate sense at that given timestep.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in simulation and experiments.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a new learning scheme for generating geometric correspondences to be used for visual odometry.	Semantic Scholar
A convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with a recurrent neural network (RNN) are trained together to detect the location of keypoints as well as to generate corresponding descriptors in one unified structure.	Semantic Scholar
The network is optimized by warping points from source frame to reference frame, with a rigid body transform.	Semantic Scholar
Essentially, learning from warping.	Semantic Scholar
The overall training is focused on movements of the camera rather than movements within the image, which leads to better consistency in the matching and ultimately better motion estimation.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better results than both related deep learning and hand crafted methods.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, as a demonstration of the promise of our method we use a naive SLAM implementation based on these keypoints and get a performance on par with ORB-SLAM.	Semantic Scholar
For intelligent robots sharing their workspace with humans, a reliable robot perception is mandatory.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the ease of interaction between a human and a robot in a shared workspace is indispensable.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a touchless motion guidance based on 2-D spatial information from a capacitive tomographic perception sensor for a kinematically redundant serial manipulator.	Semantic Scholar
The motion guidance combined with the well-deployed joint redundancy enables the robot to react on the input of the human in a certain manner, e.g., move out of the way in a certain direction of humans sharing the same workspace while the robot operation of task fulfillment is not affected.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate the position accuracy of the tomographic sensor and end effector to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach for a human hand approaching the sensor front end with a speed up to 0.3 m/s.	Semantic Scholar
We develop an idea originally proposed by Michel and Van Hentenryck of how to perform bit-vector constraint propagation on the word level.	Semantic Scholar
Most operations are propagated in constant time, assuming the bit-vector fits in a machine word.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast, bit-vector SMT solvers usually solve bit-vector problems by (ultimately) bit-blasting, that is, mapping the resulting operations to conjunctive normal form clauses, and using SAT technology to solve them.	Semantic Scholar
Bit-blasting generates intermediate variables which can be an advantage, as these can be searched on and learnt about.	Semantic Scholar
As each approach has advantages, it makes sense to try to combine them.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we describe an approach to bit-vector solving using word-level propagation with learning.	Semantic Scholar
We have designed alternative word-level propagators to Michel and Van Hentenryck’s, and evaluated different variants of the approach.	Semantic Scholar
We have also experimented with different approaches to learning and back-jumping in the solver.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the insights gained, we have built a portfolio solver, Wombit, which essentially extends the STP bit-vector solver.	Semantic Scholar
Using machine learning techniques, the solver makes a judicious up-front decision about whether to use word-level propagation or fall back on bit-blasting.	Semantic Scholar
This work describes a method to study terrestrial robot locomotion at small scales (robot mass <; 2 g) and is inspired by incredible feats of locomotion by natural organisms like insects at these same scales.	Semantic Scholar
3-D printing was used to fabricate lightweight robots and magnets were embedded in the robot legs.	Semantic Scholar
An external magnetic field was then applied to actuate the legs and move the robot.	Semantic Scholar
To illustrate the studies that this method enables, a number of different quadrapedal gaits (e.g., pronking, trotting, bounding, and waddling) are demonstrated by changing the orientation of the magnets in the robots' legs, and the robot is tested at a variety of speeds (up to 3.9 body lengths per second) and over multiple terrains, with random height variations up to 8.3 mm (1.47 times hip height).	Semantic Scholar
These results demonstrate the versatility of magnetic actuation to study terrestrial locomotion at small scales; a single control signal can produce a variety of gait patterns.	Semantic Scholar

"First, the unilateral cable tension constraints are explicitly converted into geometry constraints in the <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$s-\ddot{s}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> plane."	Semantic Scholar
"Then, a set of reachable workspaces is defined, which can be obtained analytically and the volumes of which are all much larger than the volume of the SW.

As this method does not require magnification, microrobots can be tracked in significantly larger working volumes than conventional optical methods.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of this tracking method is demonstrated by visually servoing a magnetic bead around a cubic trajectory.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we address the orienteering problem (OP) for curvature constrained vehicle.	Semantic Scholar
For a given set of target locations, each with associated reward, the OP stands to find a tour from a prescribed starting location to a given ending location such that it maximizes collected rewards while the tour length is within a given travel budget constraint.	Semantic Scholar
The addressed generalization of the Euclidean OP is called the Dubins Orienteering Problem (DOP) in which the reward collecting tour has to satisfy the limited turning radius of the Dubins vehicle.	Semantic Scholar
The DOP consists not only of selecting the most valuable targets and determination of the optimal sequence to visit them, but it also involves the determination of the vehicle's heading angle at each target location.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed solution is based on the Variable neighborhood search technique, and its feasibility is supported by an empirical evaluation in existing OP benchmarks.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, an experimental verification in a real practical scenario further demonstrates the necessity of the proposed direct solution of the Dubins Orienteering Problem.	Semantic Scholar
Mapping with laser scanners is the state-of-the-art method applied in service, industrial, medical, and rescue robotics.	Semantic Scholar
Although a lot of research has been done, maps still suffer from interferences caused by transparent and specular reflective objects.	Semantic Scholar
Glass, mirrors, shiny or translucent surfaces cause erroneous measurements depending on the incident angle of the laser beam.	Semantic Scholar
In past experiments the Mirror Detector Approach was implemented to determine such measurements with a multi-echo laser scanner.	Semantic Scholar
Recognition values are based on its differences in recorded measurements in regard to the distance of the echoes.	Semantic Scholar
This paper describes the research to distinguish between reflective and transparent objects.	Semantic Scholar
The implemented Mirror Detector was specifically modified for recognition of said objects for which four experiments were conducted; one experiment to show the map of the original Mirror Detector; two experiments to investigate intensity characteristics based on angle, distance, and material; and one experiment to show an applied discrimination with the extended version of the Mirror Detector, the Reflection Classifier Approach.	Semantic Scholar
To verify the results, a comparison with existing models was performed.	Semantic Scholar
This study showed that shiny metals, like aluminum, etc., provide significant characteristics, while mirrors are to be characterized by a mixed model of glass and shiny metal.	Semantic Scholar
Email address: rainer.koch@th-nuernberg.de (Rainer Koch) Preprint submitted to Robotics and Autonomous Systems June 10, 2016 Transparent objects turned out to be challenging because their appearance in the sensor data strongly depends on the background.	Semantic Scholar
Nevertheless, these experiments show that discrimination of transparent and reflective materials based on the reflected intensity is possible and feasible.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a computational formalization of affordances, which is able to consistently combine affordance-related evidence resulting from different observations.	Semantic Scholar
We represent affordances as Dempster–Shafer belief functions defined over the space of end-effector poses, which can be combined using uncertain logic in order to allow their hierarchical organization.	Semantic Scholar
The primary source of affordance-related evidence is visual affordance detection, which first simplifies the perceived environment into geometric primitives and then evaluates a hierarchical set of affordance definitions based on the available visual information.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting belief functions are used as initial affordance hypotheses, which are subject to further investigation and validation.	Semantic Scholar
As pure visual affordance detection can fail to properly estimate important preconditions, e.g., the stability of environmental structures, validation experiments are conducted in order to incrementally improve the system belief and the reliability of detected affordances.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed formalism is implemented and evaluated in the context of loco-manipulation affordances for humanoid robots using the simulated robots ARMAR-III and ARMAR-4.	Semantic Scholar
We present an efficient method to evaluate distances between dynamic obstacles and a number of points of interests (e.g., placed on the links of a robot) when using multiple depth cameras.	Semantic Scholar
A depth-space oriented discretization of the Cartesian space is introduced that represents at best the workspace monitored by a depth camera, including occluded points.	Semantic Scholar
A depth grid map can be initialized off line from the arrangement of the multiple depth cameras, and its peculiar search characteristics allows fusing on line the information given by the multiple sensors in a very simple and fast way.	Semantic Scholar
The real-time performance of the proposed approach is shown by means of collision avoidance experiments where two Kinect sensors monitor a human-robot coexistence task.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental evidence on the interrelation between episodic memory and semantic memory is inconclusive.	Semantic Scholar
Are they independent systems, different aspects of a single system, or separate but strongly interacting systems?	Semantic Scholar
Here, we propose a computational role for the interaction between the semantic and episodic systems that might help resolve this debate.	Semantic Scholar
We hypothesize that episodic memories are represented as sequences of activation patterns.	Semantic Scholar
These patterns are the output of a semantic representational network that compresses the high-dimensional sensory input.	Semantic Scholar
We show quantitatively that the accuracy of episodic memory crucially depends on the quality of the semantic representation.	Semantic Scholar
We compare two types of semantic representations: appropriate representations, which means that the representation is used to store input sequences that are of the same type as those that it was trained on, and inappropriate representations, which means that stored inputs differ from the training data.	Semantic Scholar
Retrieval accuracy is higher for appropriate representations because the encoded sequences are less divergent than those encoded with inappropriate representations.	Semantic Scholar
Consistent with our model prediction, we found that human subjects remember some aspects of episodes significantly more accurately if they had previously been familiarized with the objects occurring in the episode, as compared to episodes involving unfamiliar objects.	Semantic Scholar
We thus conclude that the interaction with the semantic system plays an important role for episodic memory.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present cooperative continuum robot (CCR) concept, kineto-static analysis, and model validation.	Semantic Scholar
Our motivation is to provide increased reachability and maneuverability required in a wide range of continuum robot applications, such as medical interventions.	Semantic Scholar
We present a model for the CCR with a minimum number of unknown parameters by formulating the governing equations of each continuum robot in the local frame.	Semantic Scholar
The obtained equations are then reformulated in a scaled and nondimensional iterative scheme, leading to a computationally stable and efficient model of the CCR, at rates that enable real-time simulation, design optimization, and control.	Semantic Scholar
As a case study, a coupled catheters system is chosen to perform the experimental verifications of the proposed CCR model.	Semantic Scholar
Simulations are also conducted to evaluate the enhancement of the workspace and dexterity of the CCR.	Semantic Scholar
This paper develops a new indirect method for distributed optimal control (DOC) that is applicable to optimal planning for very-large-scale robotic (VLSR) systems in complex environments.	Semantic Scholar
The method is inspired by the nested analysis and design method known as generalized reduced gradient (GRG).	Semantic Scholar
The computational complexity analysis presented in this paper shows that the GRG method is significantly more efficient than classical optimal control or direct DOC methods.	Semantic Scholar
The GRG method is demonstrated for VLSR path planning in obstacle-populated environments in which robots are subject to external forces and disturbances.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that the method significantly improves performance compared to the existing direct DOC and stochastic gradient methods.	Semantic Scholar
We study task composition in crowdsourcing and the effect of personalization and diversity on performance.	Semantic Scholar
A central process in crowdsourcing is task assignment, the mechanism through which workers find tasks.	Semantic Scholar
On popular platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, task assignment is facilitated by the ability to sort tasks by dimensions such as creation date or reward amount.	Semantic Scholar
Task composition improves task assignment by producing for each worker, a personalized summary of tasks, referred to as a Composite Task (CT).	Semantic Scholar
We propose different ways of producing CTs and formulate an optimization problem that finds for a worker, the most relevant and diverse CTs.	Semantic Scholar
We show empirically that workers’ experience is greatly improved due to personalization that enforces an adequation of CTs with workers’ skills and preferences.	Semantic Scholar
We also study and formalize various ways of diversifying tasks in each CT.	Semantic Scholar
Task diversity is grounded in organization studies that have shown its impact on worker motivation  [33] .	Semantic Scholar
Our experiments show that diverse CTs contribute to improving outcome quality.	Semantic Scholar
More specifically, we show that while task throughput and worker retention are best with ranked lists, crowdwork quality reaches its best with CTs diversified by requesters, thereby confirming that workers look to expose their “good” work to many requesters.	Semantic Scholar
A key unsolved problem in tactile robotics is how to combine tactile perception and control to interact robustly and intelligently with the surroundings.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we focus on a prototypical task of tactile exploration over surface features such as edges or ridges, which is a principal exploratory procedure of humans to recognize object shape.	Semantic Scholar
Our methods were adapted from an approach for biomimetic active touch that perceives stimulus location and identity while controlling location to aid perception.	Semantic Scholar
With minor modification to the control policy, to rotate the sensor to maintain a relative orientation and move tangentially (tactile servoing), the method applies also to tactile exploration.	Semantic Scholar
Robust exploratory tactile servoing is then attained over various two-dimensional objects, ranging from the edge of a circular disk, a volute laminar, and circular or spiral ridges.	Semantic Scholar
Conceptually, the approach brings together active perception and haptic exploration as instantiations of a common active touch algorithm, and has potential to generalize to more complex tasks requiring the flexibility and robustness of human touch.	Semantic Scholar
We present a framework for processing formulas in automatic theorem provers, with generation of detailed proofs.	Semantic Scholar
The main components are a generic contextual recursion algorithm and an extensible set of inference rules.	Semantic Scholar
Clausification, skolemization, theory-specific simplifications, and expansion of ‘let’ expressions are instances of this framework.	Semantic Scholar
With suitable data structures, proof generation adds only a linear-time overhead, and proofs can be checked in linear time.	Semantic Scholar
We implemented the approach in the SMT solver veriT.	Semantic Scholar
This allowed us to dramatically simplify the code base while increasing the number of problems for which detailed proofs can be produced, which is important for independent checking and reconstruction in proof assistants.	Semantic Scholar
To validate the framework, we implemented proof reconstruction in Isabelle/HOL.	Semantic Scholar

The objective of the letter is to align two optical structures in multi-DOF way with very high accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
The originality of the approach relies on robotic positioning associated with the use of interfered reflected light irradiance as a feedback signal rather than transmitted power.	Semantic Scholar
Fabry–Perot interference principle is especially used to provide a fast and high accurate measurement.	Semantic Scholar
An opto-mechanical model that relates the optical component poses with the interfered reflected light is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results are investigated based on a robotic multi-DOF platform, used to relatively align an optical component to an optical fiber.	Semantic Scholar
The obtained results establish that the model fits with experiments with a standard deviation below  $0.0281^{\circ }$.	Semantic Scholar
This model associated with an automated positioning strategy shows that it is possible to maximize reflectivity within less than 6 s, including multi-DOF angular misalignments identification and compensation.	Semantic Scholar
A shallow semantical embedding of free logic in classical higher-order logic is presented, which enables the off-the-shelf application of higher-order interactive and automated theorem provers for the formalisation and verification of free logic theories.	Semantic Scholar
Subsequently, this approach is applied to a selected domain of mathematics: starting from a generalization of the standard axioms for a monoid we present a stepwise development of various, mutually equivalent foundational axiom systems for category theory.	Semantic Scholar
As a side-effect of this work some (minor) issues in a prominent category theory textbook have been revealed.	Semantic Scholar
The purpose of this article is not to claim any novel results in category theory, but to demonstrate an elegant way to “implement” and utilize interactive and automated reasoning in free logic, and to present illustrative experiments.	Semantic Scholar
The range-based skyline (r-skyline) query on road networks retrieves the skyline objects for each of the query points that are within a road region, considering the objects’ spatial and non-spatial attributes.	Semantic Scholar
However, reasoning about missing query results, specified by why-not questions, has not till recently received the attention it is worth of.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we systematically carry out the study of why-not questions on the r-skyline query in the road network environment (abbrev.	Semantic Scholar
as the why-not RSQ problem).	Semantic Scholar
We present three modification strategies, including modifying the query range, modifying the why-not point, and modifying both of them, for supporting the why-not RSQ problem.	Semantic Scholar
We also propose three efficient algorithms to tackle the why-not RSQ problem, where several newly presented effective concepts/techniques are leveraged, such as the concepts of  skyline scope and skyline dominance region, non-spatial attribute modification pruning, and G-tree index.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experimental evaluation using both real and synthetic data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Energy-aware motion planning for robotic systems has received increasing attention during recent years, due to environmental and economic reasons.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a framework for defining and solving different types of optimal control problems for variable stiffness actuated robots.	Semantic Scholar
These robots can store and release energy during task execution, but motion planning and control are made difficult by the presence of several physical constraints.	Semantic Scholar
In the optimal control problems formulated in this letter, constraints on power and energy are explicitly accounted for, while minimizing energy consumption or maximizing performance.	Semantic Scholar
The validity of our approach has been tested on a ball-throwing case study, for which simulation and experimental results are presented and discussed.	Semantic Scholar
Fine needles can easily be deflected, making accurate needle insertion into a tumor difficult.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, it is difficult to insert the needle into a tumor in the lower abdomen because the needle has to pass through various tissues.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, for lower abdominal needle insertion, we intend to develop a planning method for the optimal insertion path to minimize the deflection based on computed tomography images.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we analyze the deflection while performing needle insertion with axial rotation under conditions of various insertion angles into individual tissues composing the lower abdomen (pork loin and porcine small bowel) and develop a basic planning procedure to determine the optimal insertion path based on the analysis.	Semantic Scholar
From the results, we confirmed that the insertion angle should be minimized as much as possible.	Semantic Scholar
We then develop a planning method based on insertion angles into individual tissues the needle needs to pass through.	Semantic Scholar
We assumed that it is possible to determine the optimal insertion path by providing a weighting factor to the effect of the insertion angle depending on the depth of insertion, considering that the effect of the insertion angle on deflection in deep places of the body is smaller than the effect around the body surface.	Semantic Scholar
To verify the concept of the proposed planning procedure, we perform experiments with a simple model composed of two tissues.	Semantic Scholar
From the results, we show that the optimal insertion path can be planned by setting the optimal ratio of individual weighting factors.	Semantic Scholar
During abdominal palpation diagnosis, a medical practitioner would change the stiffness of their fingers in order to improve the detection of hard nodules or abnormalities in soft tissue to maximize the haptic information gain via tendons.	Semantic Scholar
Our recent experiments using a controllable stiffness robotic probe representing a human finger also confirmed that such stiffness control in the finger can enhance the accuracy of detecting hard nodules in soft tissue.	Semantic Scholar
However, the limited range of stiffness achieved by the antagonistic springs variable stiffness joint subject to size constraints made it unsuitable for a wide range of physical examination scenarios spanning from breast to abdominal examination.	Semantic Scholar
"In this letter, we present a new robotic probe based on a variable lever mechanism able to achieve stiffness ranging from <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\text{0.64}$</tex-math></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\text{1.06}$</tex-math></inline-formula> N<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\cdot$</tex-math></inline-formula>m/rad that extends the maximum stiffness by around <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\text{16}$</tex-math></inline-formula> times and the stiffness range by <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\text{33}$</tex-math></inline-formula> times."	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents the mechanical model of the novel probe, the finite element simulation as well as experimental characterization of the stiffness response for lever actuation.	Semantic Scholar
Most deep reinforcement learning techniques are unsuitable for robotics, as they require too much interaction time to learn useful, general control policies.	Semantic Scholar
This problem can be largely attributed to the fact that a state representation needs to be learned as a part of learning control policies, which can only be done through fitting expected returns based on observed rewards.	Semantic Scholar
While the reward function provides information on the desirability of the state of the world, it does not necessarily provide information on how to distill a good, general representation of that state from the sensory observations.	Semantic Scholar
State representation learning objectives can be used to help learn such a representation.	Semantic Scholar
While many of these objectives have been proposed, they are typically not directly combined with reinforcement learning algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
We investigate several methods for integrating state representation learning into reinforcement learning.	Semantic Scholar
In these methods, the state representation learning objectives help regularize the state representation during the reinforcement learning, and the reinforcement learning itself is viewed as a crucial state representation learning objective and allowed to help shape the representation.	Semantic Scholar
Using autonomous racing tests in the TORCS simulator, we show how the integrated methods quickly learn policies that generalize to new environments much better than deep reinforcement learning without state representation learning.	Semantic Scholar
Draglines are one of the largest earthmoving machines in surface mining.	Semantic Scholar
They are employed to remove the overburden near the surface, giving access to a seam of the target mineral or coal underneath.	Semantic Scholar
Their excavation productivity is significantly affected by the high-level operation strategy of where to position the dragline, what to dig at each position and where to dump the removed material.	Semantic Scholar
This letter explores the potential of using the Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm for planning this operation strategy.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we adapt the MCTS algorithm to compute the dragline positioning sequences when a fixed digging and dumping strategy is applied at each position.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of the adapted MCTS algorithm is compared to a previously developed A* search algorithm and a greedy algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation results show that the MCTS algorithm is able to find near-optimal positioning sequences using significantly less time and memory than the A* algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The solutions from the MCTS algorithm also largely outperform the solutions from the greedy algorithm in all the test scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
These results suggest that the MCTS algorithm can be used to plan the operation strategy when decisions about the digging and dumping operations are also considered.	Semantic Scholar
We formulate the computational processes of perception in the framework of the principle of least action by postulating the theoretical action as a time integral of the variational free energy in the neurosciences.	Semantic Scholar
The free energy principle is accordingly rephrased, on autopoetic grounds, as follows: all viable organisms attempt to minimize their sensory uncertainty about an unpredictable environment over a temporal horizon.	Semantic Scholar
By taking the variation of informational action, we derive neural recognition dynamics (RD), which by construction reduces to the Bayesian filtering of external states from noisy sensory inputs.	Semantic Scholar
Consequently, we effectively cast the gradient-descent scheme of minimizing the free energy into Hamiltonian mechanics by addressing only the positions and momenta of the organisms' representations of the causal environment.	Semantic Scholar
To demonstrate the utility of our theory, we show how the RD may be implemented in a neuronally based biophysical model at a single-cell level and subsequently in a coarse-grained, hierarchical architecture of the brain.	Semantic Scholar
We also present numerical solutions to the RD for a model brain and analyze the perceptual trajectories around attractors in neural state space.	Semantic Scholar
Modeling videos and image sets by linear subspaces has achieved great success in various visual recognition tasks.	Semantic Scholar
However, subspaces constructed from visual data are always notoriously embedded in a high-dimensional ambient space, which limits the applicability of existing techniques.	Semantic Scholar
This letter explores the possibility of proposing a geometry-aware framework for constructing lower-dimensional subspaces with maximum discriminative power from high-dimensional subspaces in the supervised scenario.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we make use of Riemannian geometry and optimization techniques on matrix manifolds to learn an orthogonal projection, which shows that the learning process can be formulated as an unconstrained optimization problem on a Grassmann manifold.	Semantic Scholar
With this natural geometry, any metric on the Grassmann manifold can theoretically be used in our model.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental evaluations on several data sets show that our approach results in significantly higher accuracy than other state-of-the-art algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a cost-sensitive active Question-Answering (QA) framework for learning a nine-layer And-Or graph (AOG) from web images.	Semantic Scholar
The AOG explicitly represents object categories, poses/viewpoints, parts, and detailed structures within the parts in a compositional hierarchy.	Semantic Scholar
The QA framework is designed to minimize an overall risk, which trades off the loss and query costs.	Semantic Scholar
The loss is defined for nodes in all layers of the AOG, including the generative loss (measuring the likelihood of the images) and the discriminative loss (measuring the fitness to human answers).	Semantic Scholar
The cost comprises both the human labor of answering questions and the computational cost of model learning.	Semantic Scholar
The cost-sensitive QA framework iteratively selects different storylines of questions to update different nodes in the AOG.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments showed that our method required much less human supervision (e.g.	Semantic Scholar
labeling parts on 3–10 training objects for each category) and achieved better performance than baseline methods.	Semantic Scholar
Conventional semi-supervised clustering approaches have several shortcomings, such as (1) not fully utilizing all useful must-link and cannot-link constraints, (2) not considering how to deal with high dimensional data with noise, and (3) not fully addressing the need to use an adaptive process to further improve the performance of the algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we first propose the transitive closure based constraint propagation approach, which makes use of the transitive closure operator and the affinity propagation to address the first limitation.	Semantic Scholar
Then, the random subspace based semi-supervised clustering ensemble framework with a set of proposed confidence factors is designed to address the second limitation and provide more stable, robust, and accurate results.	Semantic Scholar
Next, the adaptive semi-supervised clustering ensemble framework is proposed to address the third limitation, which adopts a newly designed adaptive process to search for the optimal subspace set.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we adopt a set of nonparametric tests to compare different semi-supervised clustering ensemble approaches over multiple datasets.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results on 20 real high dimensional cancer datasets with noisy genes and 10 datasets from UCI datasets and KEEL datasets show that (1) The proposed approaches work well on most of the real-world datasets.	Semantic Scholar
(2) It outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches on 12 out of 20 cancer datasets, and 8 out of 10 UCI machine learning datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the flexibility in modelling data heterogeneity, heterogeneous information network (HIN) has been adopted to characterize complex and heterogeneous auxiliary data in recommender systems, called HIN based recommendation.	Semantic Scholar
It is challenging to develop effective methods for HIN based recommendation in both extraction and exploitation of the information from HINs.	Semantic Scholar
Most of HIN based recommendation methods rely on path based similarity, which cannot fully mine latent structure features of users and items.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous network embedding based approach for HIN based recommendation, called HERec.	Semantic Scholar
To embed HINs, we design a meta-path based random walk strategy to generate meaningful node sequences for network embedding.	Semantic Scholar
The learned node embeddings are first transformed by a set of fusion functions, and subsequently integrated into an extended matrix factorization (MF) model.	Semantic Scholar
The extended MF model together with fusion functions are jointly optimized for the rating prediction task.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the HERec model.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we show the capability of the HERec model for the cold-start problem, and reveal that the transformed embedding information from HINs can improve the recommendation performance.	Semantic Scholar
Controlling musculoskeletal systems, especially robots actuated by pneumatic artificial muscles, is a challenging task due to nonlinearities, hysteresis effects, massive actuator delay, and unobservable dependencies such as temperature.	Semantic Scholar
Despite such difficulties, muscular systems offer many beneficial properties to achieve human-comparable performance in uncertain and fast-changing tasks.	Semantic Scholar
For example, muscles are backdrivable and provide variable stiffness while offering high forces to reach high accelerations.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the embodied intelligence deriving from the compliance might reduce the control demands for specific tasks.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we address the problem of how to accurately control musculoskeletal robots.	Semantic Scholar
To address this issue, we propose to learn probabilistic forward dynamics models using Gaussian processes and, subsequently, to employ these models for control.	Semantic Scholar
However, Gaussian processes dynamics models cannot be set up for our musculoskeletal robot as for traditional motor-driven robots because of unclear state composition, etc.	Semantic Scholar
We hence empirically study and discuss in detail how to tune these approaches to complex musculoskeletal robots and their specific challenges.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we show that our model can be used to accurately control an antagonistic pair of pneumatic artificial muscles for a trajectory tracking task while considering only one-step-ahead predictions of the forward model and incorporating model uncertainty.	Semantic Scholar
We study an automated verification method for functional correctness of parallel programs running on graphics processing units (GPUs).	Semantic Scholar
Our method is based on Kojima and Igarashi’s Hoare logic for GPU programs.	Semantic Scholar
Our algorithm generates verification conditions (VCs) from a program annotated by specifications and loop invariants, and passes them to off-the-shelf SMT solvers.	Semantic Scholar
It is often impossible, however, to solve naively generated VCs in reasonable time.	Semantic Scholar
A main difficulty stems from quantifiers over threads due to the parallel nature of GPU programs.	Semantic Scholar
To overcome this difficulty, we additionally apply several transformations to simplify VCs before calling SMT solvers.	Semantic Scholar
Our implementation successfully verifies correctness of several GPU programs, including matrix multiplication optimized by using shared memory.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to many existing verification tools for GPU programs, our verifier succeeds in verifying fully parameterized programs: parameters such as the number of threads and the sizes of matrices are all symbolic.	Semantic Scholar
We empirically confirm that our simplification heuristics is highly effective for improving efficiency of the verification procedure.	Semantic Scholar
Stability and task accomplishment of Internet-based teleoperation systems are greatly susceptible to the network latency and uncertainty.	Semantic Scholar
Control of a teleoperation system aims to provide satisfactory performance of the remote task and in some cases to provide the operator with sensory feedback.	Semantic Scholar
This paper reviews the recent control methodologies used for teleoperation systems with model uncertainty, unknown time-varying delay, and Internet-based communication.	Semantic Scholar
The focus is on control algorithms that are suitable for nonlinear uncertain systems to decrease restrictions and increase application scope.	Semantic Scholar
The key features of these control algorithms are highlighted, and their advantages and disadvantages are comparatively discussed.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a fully fabric-based bidirectional soft robotic glove designed to assist hand impaired patients in rehabilitation exercises and performing activities of daily living.	Semantic Scholar
The glove provides both active finger flexion and extension for hand assistance and rehabilitative training, through its embedded fabric-based actuators that are fabricated by heat press and ultrasonic welding of flexible thermoplastic polyurethane-coated fabrics.	Semantic Scholar
Compared to previous developed elastomeric-based actuators, the actuators are able to achieve smaller bend radius and generate sufficient force and torque to assist in both finger flexion and extension at lower air pressure.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, experiments were conducted to characterize the performances of the glove in terms of its kinematic and grip strength assistances on five healthy participants.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, we present a graphical-user interface that allows user to choose the desired rehabilitation exercises and control modes, which include button-controlled-assistive mode, cyclic movement training, intention-driven task-specific training, and bilateral rehabilitation training.

A hippocampal prosthesis is a very large scale integration (VLSI) biochip that needs to be implanted in the biological brain to solve a cognitive dysfunction.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a novel low-complexity, small-area, and low-power programmable hippocampal neural network application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for a hippocampal prosthesis.	Semantic Scholar
It is based on the nonlinear dynamical model of the hippocampus: namely multi-input, multi-output (MIMO)–generalized Laguerre-Volterra model (GLVM).	Semantic Scholar
It can realize the real-time prediction of hippocampal neural activity.	Semantic Scholar
New hardware architecture, a storage space configuration scheme, low-power convolution, and gaussian random number generator modules are proposed.	Semantic Scholar
The ASIC is fabricated in 40 nm technology with a core area of 0.122 mm2 and test power of 84.4 μW.	Semantic Scholar
Compared with the design based on the traditional architecture, experimental results show that the core area of the chip is reduced by 84.94% and the core power is reduced by 24.30%.	Semantic Scholar

Grasping and manipulation of biological tissue are crucial processes during Robot-Assisted Surgery (RAS).	Semantic Scholar
An intelligent system that aids surgeons in maintaining a reliable, atraumatic grasp on tissue, would allow them to focus on the clinical task, and potentially improve safety and performance.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we investigate slip detection of grasped tissue.	Semantic Scholar
Because tissue is moist, conformable, and delicate, and because the sensor must work in a surgical environment, this application requires a departure from traditional slip-sensing methods.	Semantic Scholar
We present a method that uses sensor fusion with a da Vinci surgical system to identify slip after a reliable grasp is made.	Semantic Scholar
A transient simulation of the thermal-based sensor was used to describe its expected behavior.	Semantic Scholar
The sensor's response to slips was then validated.	Semantic Scholar
Subsequent experiments involved building a custom da Vinci 8 mm instrument with the sensor integrated and interacting with ex vivo porcine tissue.	Semantic Scholar
Results demonstrated slip detection within 2.1 mm average motion across five tissue types.	Semantic Scholar
During freeform grasping experiments, slip was detected with a 92% true positive rate and 94% positive predictive value.	Semantic Scholar
More and more biologically inspired robots present spines with multiples degrees of freedom to resemble their biological counterparts.	Semantic Scholar
The function of the spine on both animal and robot can play an important role in locomotion.	Semantic Scholar
If it has enough degrees of freedom to allow independent control of both shoulder and pelvic girdle (i.e., the points of attachment of body and limb), it can be used to extend the reach of the legs or to increase turning capabilities.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present the spine controller for a sprawling quadrupedal robot.	Semantic Scholar
The controller achieves a synchronization between spine and legs and allows a precise control of the girdle positions by solving the inverse kinematics of the spine.	Semantic Scholar
The controller is validated in simulation and experiments with the real robot showing an ease in the control of the locomotion and achieving a very good tracking between the girdle trajectories with a very small, noncumulative error (less than 6% of the inter-girdle distance).	Semantic Scholar
This controller enables both the human operation and the implementation of autonomous path planning and navigation algorithms for these type of amphibious robots, making them more suitable for scenarios with limited maneuverability such as inside pipes or in collapsed buildings.	Semantic Scholar
We present EVO, an event-based visual odometry algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Our algorithm successfully leverages the outstanding properties of event cameras to track fast camera motions while recovering a semidense three-dimensional (3-D) map of the environment.	Semantic Scholar
The implementation runs in real time on a standard CPU and outputs up to several hundred pose estimates per second.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the nature of event cameras, our algorithm is unaffected by motion blur and operates very well in challenging, high dynamic range conditions with strong illumination changes.	Semantic Scholar
To achieve this, we combine a novel, event-based tracking approach based on image-to-model alignment with a recent event-based 3-D reconstruction algorithm in a parallel fashion.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, we show that the output of our pipeline can be used to reconstruct intensity images from the binary event stream, though our algorithm does not require such intensity information.	Semantic Scholar
We believe that this work makes significant progress in simultaneous localization and mapping by unlocking the potential of event cameras.	Semantic Scholar
This allows us to tackle challenging scenarios that are currently inaccessible to standard cameras.	Semantic Scholar
We present a novel method to fuse the power of deep networks with the computational efficiency of geometric and probabilistic localization algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to other methods that completely replace a classical visual estimator with a deep network, we propose an approach that uses a convolutional neural network to learn difficult-to-model corrections to the estimator from ground-truth training data.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we derive a novel loss function for learning $ \mathrm{SE}(3)$  corrections based on a matrix Lie groups approach, with a natural formulation for balancing translation and rotation errors.	Semantic Scholar
We use this loss to train a deep pose correction network (DPC-Net) that predicts corrections for a particular estimator, sensor and environment.	Semantic Scholar
Using the KITTI odometry dataset, we demonstrate significant improvements to the accuracy of a computationally-efficient sparse stereo visual odometry pipeline, that render it as accurate as a modern computationally-intensive dense estimator.	Semantic Scholar
Further, we show how DPC-Net can be used to mitigate the effect of poorly calibrated lens distortion parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Object recognition is essential to enable robots to interact with their environment.	Semantic Scholar
Robots should be capable, on one hand of recognizing previously experienced objects, and on the other, of using the experienced objects for learning novel objects, i.e.	Semantic Scholar
objects for which training data are not available.	Semantic Scholar
Recognition of such novel objects can be achieved with Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL).	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we show the potential of ZSL for haptic recognition.	Semantic Scholar
First, we design a zero-shot haptic recognition algorithm and, using the extensive PHAC-2 database [1] as well as our own, we adapt, analyze and optimize the ZSL for the challenges and constraints characteristic of haptic recognition.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we apply the optimized algorithm for haptic recognition of daily-life objects using an anthropomorphic robot hand.	Semantic Scholar
Our algorithm enables the robot to recognize eight of the ten novel objects handed to it.	Semantic Scholar
The control of mechatronic systems can often be enhanced if realtime information on the derivatives of a signal is available.	Semantic Scholar
These derivatives are not always measurable by sensors and should be estimated.	Semantic Scholar
Simple numerical derivatives cannot be applied, due to noise on the measured signals.	Semantic Scholar
Several researchers managed to reduce the noise and calculate the derivative but as a drawback the estimation has a time delay.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we focus on the realtime derivative estimation of quasi-cyclic signals.	Semantic Scholar
Cycles of these signals are very similar but not exactly alike.	Semantic Scholar
At each time instant, the derivatives of the previous cycle are fed to a linear state estimator as virtual measurements.	Semantic Scholar
This allows to have a delay-free estimation.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method is tested experimentally on a human walking in an exoskeleton with rotary joint encoders.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that it is possible to estimate the angular acceleration of hip, knee, and ankle joint in realtime without delay.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm is compared with the technique of adaptive oscillators with non-linear filter, used in literature for a similar application.	Semantic Scholar
Our method estimates acceleration better both in steady-state and transient periods.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a novel concept of braiding thin McKibben muscles to improve their contracting ability compared to original muscles.	Semantic Scholar
Whereas a single original muscle and the conventional bundled muscle had a contracting ratio of 28%, braiding the muscles realized a contracting ratio of 37%.	Semantic Scholar
We designed, fabricated, and tested several prototypes with different braiding parameters, and demonstrated their effects both theoretically and experimentally.	Semantic Scholar
The results were promising and we believe that thin braided McKibben muscles will facilitate the development of novel musculoskeletal robots and be useful in various applications requiring soft robotic abilities.	Semantic Scholar
The concept of postural synergy is recently being widely applied to the mechanical design of prosthesis.	Semantic Scholar
However, there are few research literatures on the application of postural synergy in the mechanical design of an exoskeletal rehabilitation robot.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, the reaching movements of human arm are analyzed by the principal component analysis method and two most significant synergies of the joints of human arm, which can account for more than 80% of the variation, are extracted.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a postural synergy based method to design the kinematic transmission mechanism for a multi-joint upper-limb exoskeletal rehabilitation robot with two actuators.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, the configuration of passive joints and balance weights is put forward to improve the performance of the robot.	Semantic Scholar
The postural synergy based design method is formulated for replicating human arm reaching movements.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, tests are taken on the prototype to validate the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the proposed method can be potentially extended to the design of underactuated robotic arm or manipulator which is just required to perform the specific types of movements.	Semantic Scholar
Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a powerful statistical tool for detecting the linear relationship between two sets of multivariate variables.	Semantic Scholar
Kernel generalization of it, namely, kernel CCA is proposed to describe nonlinear relationship between two variables.	Semantic Scholar
Although kernel CCA can achieve dimensionality reduction results for high-dimensional data feature selection problem, it also yields the so called over-fitting phenomenon.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we consider a new kernel CCA algorithm via randomized Kaczmarz method.	Semantic Scholar
The main contributions of the paper are: (1) A new kernel CCA algorithm is developed, (2) theoretical convergence of the proposed algorithm is addressed by means of scaled condition number, (3) a lower bound which addresses the minimum number of iterations is presented.	Semantic Scholar
We test on both synthetic dataset and several real-world datasets in cross-language document retrieval and content-based image retrieval to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical results imply the performance and efficiency of the new algorithm, which is competitive with several state-of-the-art kernel CCA methods.	Semantic Scholar
Embryo vitrification is an essential cryopreservation technique in IVF (in vitro fertilization) clinics.	Semantic Scholar
Vitrification involves pick-and-place of an embryo in multiple types of cryoprotectant solutions for processing before placing the embryo on a vitrification straw for cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen.	Semantic Scholar
Manual operation and existing robotic vitrification are only capable of aspirating one embryo at a time for processing; thus, other embryos are kept in the culture dish on a microscope stage for tens of minutes, which is detrimental to the development potential of the embryos.	Semantic Scholar
In order to minimize the total vitrification time, we have recently developed a robotic system for the pick-and-place of multiple embryos and process every three embryos as a group.	Semantic Scholar
Visual detection algorithms were developed for locating multiple embryos in three dimensions.	Semantic Scholar
Dynamics of embryo motion was modeled and a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller was developed to aspirate each embryo with a minimum volume of excess medium.	Semantic Scholar
The robotic system then placed the embryos onto vitrification straws by depositing a thin layer of medium that contains the embryos, and finally, aspirated away the medium surrounding the embryo for fast cooling.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results demonstrate that robotic multiembryo processing has a throughput three times that of manual operation and achieved a high success rate of 95.2%, embryo survival rate of 90.0%, and development rate of 88.8%.	Semantic Scholar

The 14th Conference on the Integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Operations Research (OR) Techniques in Constraint Programming (CPAIOR 2017) was held in Padova, Italy, from June 5 to June 8, 2017.	Semantic Scholar
After a successful series of five CPAIOR international workshops in Ferrara (Italy), Paderborn (Germany), Ashford (UK), Le Croisic (France), and Montreal (Canada), in 2004 CPAIOR evolved into a conference.	Semantic Scholar
More than 100 participants attended the first meeting held in Nice (France).	Semantic Scholar
In the subsequent years, CPAIOR was held in Prague (Czech Republic), Cork (Ireland), Brussels (Belgium), Paris (France), Pittsburgh (USA), Bologna (Italy), Berlin (Germany), Nantes (France), Yorktown Heights (USA), Cork (Ireland), Barcelona (Spain) and Banff (Canada).	Semantic Scholar
In 2017 CPAIOR returned to Italy.	Semantic Scholar
The aim of the CPAIOR conference series is to bring together researchers from constraint programming (CP), artificial intelligence (AI), and operations research (OR) to present new techniques or applications in the intersection of these fields, as well as to provide an opportunity for researchers in one area to learn about techniques in the others.	Semantic Scholar
A key objective of the conference is to demonstrate how the integration of techniques from different fields can lead to novel and effective methods for large and complex problems.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, papers that actively combine, integrate, or contrast approaches from more than one of the areas are especially welcome.	Semantic Scholar
Application papers showcasing CP/AI/OR techniques on innovative and challenging applications or experience reports on such applications are also strongly encouraged.	Semantic Scholar
The optimal coalition structure determination problem is in general computationally hard.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we identify some problem instances for which the space of possible coalition structures has a certain form and constructively prove that the problem is polynomial time solvable.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we consider games with an ordering over the players and introduce a distance metric for measuring the distance between any two structures.	Semantic Scholar
In terms of this metric, we define the property of monotonicity, meaning that coalition structures closer to the optimal, as measured by the metric, have higher value than those further away.	Semantic Scholar
Similarly, quasi-monotonicity means that part of the space of coalition structures is monotonic, while part of it is non-monotonic.	Semantic Scholar
(Quasi)-monotonicity is a property that can be satisfied by coalition games in characteristic function form and also those in partition function form.	Semantic Scholar
For a setting with a monotonic value function and a known player ordering, we prove that the optimal coalition structure determination problem is polynomial time solvable and devise such an algorithm using a greedy approach.	Semantic Scholar
We extend this algorithm to quasi-monotonic value functions and demonstrate how its time complexity improves from exponential to polynomial as the degree of monotonicity of the value function increases.	Semantic Scholar
We go further and consider a setting in which the value function is monotonic and an ordering over the players is known to exist but ordering itself is unknown.	Semantic Scholar
For this setting too, we prove that the coalition structure determination problem is polynomial time solvable and devise such an algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
This review examines the relevance of parameter identifiability for statistical models used in machine learning.	Semantic Scholar
In addition to defining main concepts, we address several issues of identifiability closely related to machine learning, showing the advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art research and demonstrating recent progress.	Semantic Scholar
First, we review criteria for determining the parameter structure of models from the literature.	Semantic Scholar
This has three related issues: parameter identifiability, parameter redundancy, and reparameterization.	Semantic Scholar
Second, we review the deep influence of identifiability on various aspects of machine learning from theoretical and application viewpoints.	Semantic Scholar
In addition to illustrating the utility and influence of identifiability, we emphasize the interplay among identifiability theory, machine learning, mathematical statistics, information theory, optimization theory, information geometry, Riemann geometry, symbolic computation, Bayesian inference, algebraic geometry, and others.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we present a new perspective together with the associated challenges.	Semantic Scholar
Developing an automated vehicle, that can handle complicated driving scenarios and appropriately interact with other road users, requires the ability to semantically learn and understand driving environment, oftentimes, based on analyzing massive amounts of naturalistic driving data.	Semantic Scholar
An important paradigm that allows automated vehicles to both learn from human drivers and gain insights is understanding the principal compositions of the entire traffic, termed as traffic primitives.	Semantic Scholar
However, the exploding data growth presents a great challenge in extracting primitives from high-dimensional time-series traffic data with various types of road users engaged.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, automatically extracting primitives is becoming one of the cost-efficient ways to help autonomous vehicles understand and predict the complex traffic scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the extracted primitives from raw data should 1) be appropriate for automated driving applications and also 2) be easily used to generate new traffic scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
However, existing literature does not provide a method to automatically learn these primitives from large-scale traffic data.	Semantic Scholar
The contribution of this letter has two manifolds.	Semantic Scholar
The first one is that we proposed a new framework to generate new traffic scenarios from a handful of limited traffic data.	Semantic Scholar
The second one is that, we introduce a nonparametric Bayesian learning method—a sticky hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model—to automatically extract primitives from multidimensional traffic data without prior knowledge of the primitive settings.	Semantic Scholar
The developed method is then validated using one day of naturalistic driving data.	Semantic Scholar
Experiment results show that the nonparametric Bayesian learning method is able to extract primitives from traffic scenarios where both the binary and continuous events coexist.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a 2-speed small transmission mechanism based on twisted string actuation (TSA).	Semantic Scholar
The proposed mechanism achieves a compact and simplified two-stage transmission ratio by adjusting the radius of the twisted string.	Semantic Scholar
This transmission mechanism does not require the complex mechanical parts and mechanisms of conventional transmission systems.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the mechanism can achieve a braking effect without an additional mechanical component via the nonlinearity of the rotational-linear transmission provided by TSA.	Semantic Scholar
The prototype is sufficiently small to be embedded in a robot hand and can be easily installed in a small robotic system.	Semantic Scholar
This mechanism can provide an energy-efficient driving strategy and a wider driving range for small robot systems.	Semantic Scholar
This letter introduces a new framework for modeling the optimal path planning problem of rectangular robots.	Semantic Scholar
Typically constraints for the safe, obstacle-avoiding path involve a set of inequalities expressed using logical <sc> or</sc> operations, which makes the problem difficult to solve using existing optimization algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
"Inspired by the geometry of the unit sphere of the weighted <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$L_p$</tex-math> </inline-formula> norm, the authors find exact and approximate constraints for safe configurations using only logical <sc>and</sc> operations."	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method does not require integer programming nor computation of a Minkowski sum in the configuration space.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the authors analyze two different cases of obstacle geometry: circular obstacles and rectangular obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
"Using the weighted <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$L_p$</tex-math> </inline-formula> norm requires six inequalities to represent the exact constraints for collision avoidance of circular obstacles using <sc>and</sc> operations, and eight inequalities for rectangular obstacles."	Semantic Scholar
Four shortest path planning examples are analyzed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, L1-norm distance measure based Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) techniques have been shown to be robust against outliers.	Semantic Scholar
However, these methods have no guarantee of obtaining a satisfactory-enough performance due to the insufficient robustness of L1-norm measure.	Semantic Scholar
To mitigate this problem, inspired by recent works on Lp-norm based learning, this paper proposes a new discriminant method, called Lp- and Ls-Norm Distance Based Robust Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA-Lsp).	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method achieves robustness by replacing the L2-norm within- and between-class distances in conventional LDA with Lp- and Ls-norm ones.	Semantic Scholar
By specifying the values of p and s, many of previous efforts can be naturally expressed by our objective.	Semantic Scholar
The requirement of simultaneously maximizing and minimizing a number of Lp- and Ls-norm terms results in a difficulty to the optimization of the formulated objective.	Semantic Scholar
As one of the important contributions of this paper, we design an efficient iterative algorithm to address this problem, and also conduct some insightful analysis on the existence of local minimum and the convergence of the proposed algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Theoretical insights of our method are further supported by promising experimental results on several images databases.	Semantic Scholar
Full autonomy for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires the capability to autonomously detect potential landing sites in unknown and unstructured terrain, allowing for self-governed mission completion or handling of emergency situations.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a perception system addressing this challenge by detecting landing sites based on their texture and geometric shape without using any prior knowledge about the environment.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method considers hazards within the landing region such as terrain roughness and slope, surrounding obstacles that obscure the landing approach path, and the local wind field that is estimated by the on-board EKF.	Semantic Scholar
The latter enables applicability of the proposed method on small-scale autonomous planes without landing gear.	Semantic Scholar
A safe approach path is computed based on the UAV dynamics, expected state estimation and actuator uncertainty, and the on-board computed elevation map.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed framework has been successfully tested on photo-realistic synthetic datasets and in challenging real-world environments.	Semantic Scholar
Topological data analysis (TDA) has emerged as one of the most promising techniques to reconstruct the unknown shapes of high-dimensional spaces from observed data samples.	Semantic Scholar
TDA, thus, yields key shape descriptors in the form of persistent topological features that can be used for any supervised or unsupervised learning task, including multi-way classification.	Semantic Scholar
Sparse sampling, on the other hand, provides a highly efficient technique to reconstruct signals in the spatial-temporal domain from just a few carefully-chosen samples.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we present a new method, referred to as the Sparse-TDA algorithm, that combines favorable aspects of the two techniques.	Semantic Scholar
This combination is realized by selecting an optimal set of sparse pixel samples from the persistent features generated by a vector-based TDA algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
These sparse samples are selected from a low-rank matrix representation of persistent features using QR pivoting.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the Sparse-TDA method demonstrates promising performance on three benchmark problems related to human posture recognition and image texture classification.	Semantic Scholar
Web post and user stance labeling is challenging not only because of the informality and variation in language on the Web but also because of the lack of labeled data on fast-emerging new topics—even the labeled data we do have are usually heavily skewed.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a joint user-post approach for stance labeling to mitigate the latter two difficulties.	Semantic Scholar
In labeling post stance, the proposed approach considers post content as well as posting and liking behavior, which involves users.	Semantic Scholar
Sentiment analysis is applied to posts to acquire their initial stance, and then the post and user stance are updated iteratively with correlated posting-related actions.	Semantic Scholar
The whole process works with limited labeled data, which solves the first problem.	Semantic Scholar
We use real interaction between authors and readers for stance labeling.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that the proposed approach not only substantially improves content-based post stance labeling, but also yields better performance for the minor stance class, which solves the second problem.	Semantic Scholar
Heart-rate estimation is a fundamental feature of modern wearable devices.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we propose a machine learning technique to estimate heart-rate from electrocardiogram (ECG) data collected using wearable devices.	Semantic Scholar
The novelty of our approach lies in (1) encoding spatio-temporal properties of ECG signals directly into spike train and using this to excite recurrently connected spiking neurons in a Liquid State Machine computation model; (2) a novel learning algorithm; and (3) an intelligently designed unsupervised readout based on Fuzzy c-Means clustering of spike responses from a subset of neurons (Liquid states), selected using particle swarm optimization.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach differs from existing works by learning directly from ECG signals (allowing personalization), without requiring costly data annotations.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, our approach can be easily implemented on state-of-the-art spiking-based neuromorphic systems, offering high accuracy, yet significantly low energy footprint, leading to an extended battery-life of wearable devices.	Semantic Scholar
We validated our approach with CARLsim, a GPU accelerated spiking neural network simulator modeling Izhikevich spiking neurons with Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and homeostatic scaling.	Semantic Scholar
A range of subjects is considered from in-house clinical trials and public ECG databases.	Semantic Scholar
Results show high accuracy and low energy footprint in heart-rate estimation across subjects with and without cardiac irregularities, signifying the strong potential of this approach to be integrated in future wearable devices.	Semantic Scholar

Compliance has become a key requirement for robots meant to interact with humans.	Semantic Scholar
It is viewed as a necessary property to increase safety and efficiency in human–robot cooperative actions.	Semantic Scholar
In humans, compliance takes three dimensions: mechanical, cognitive and social.	Semantic Scholar
While robotics has focused primarily on modeling the first two, we here discuss the importance to consider also the social dimension that compliance takes in human–human interactions and how this can be extended to human–robot interactions.	Semantic Scholar
We discuss situations in which requesting that the human complies to the machine may be advantageous, and not the converse.	Semantic Scholar
We conclude with a list of open ethical and legal issues that may arise from developing actively non-compliant machines.	Semantic Scholar

Many machine learning problems can be formulated as predicting labels for a pair of objects.	Semantic Scholar
Problems of that kind are often referred to as pairwise learning, dyadic prediction, or network inference problems.	Semantic Scholar
During the past decade, kernel methods have played a dominant role in pairwise learning.	Semantic Scholar
They still obtain a state-of-the-art predictive performance, but a theoretical analysis of their behavior has been underexplored in the machine learning literature.	Semantic Scholar
In this work we review and unify kernel-based algorithms that are commonly used in different pairwise learning settings, ranging from matrix filtering to zero-shot learning.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we focus on closed-form efficient instantiations of Kronecker kernel ridge regression.	Semantic Scholar
We show that independent task kernel ridge regression, two-step kernel ridge regression, and a linear matrix filter arise naturally as a special case of Kronecker kernel ridge regression, implying that all these methods implicitly minimize a squared loss.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we analyze universality, consistency, and spectral filtering properties.	Semantic Scholar
Our theoretical results provide valuable insights into assessing the advantages and limitations of existing pairwise learning methods.	Semantic Scholar

Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a challenging task that has received increasing attention from both the computer vision and the natural language processing communities.	Semantic Scholar
Given an image and a question in natural language, it requires reasoning over visual elements of the image and general knowledge to infer the correct answer.	Semantic Scholar
In the first part of this survey, we examine the state of the art by comparing modern approaches to the problem.	Semantic Scholar
We classify methods by their mechanism to connect the visual and textual modalities.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we examine the common approach of combining convolutional and recurrent neural networks to map images and questions to a common feature space.	Semantic Scholar
We also discuss memory-augmented and modular architectures that interface with structured knowledge bases.	Semantic Scholar
In the second part of this survey, we review the datasets available for training and evaluating VQA systems.	Semantic Scholar
The various datatsets contain questions at different levels of complexity, which require different capabilities and types of reasoning.	Semantic Scholar
We examine in depth the question/answer pairs from the Visual Genome project, and evaluate the relevance of the structured annotations of images with scene graphs for VQA.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we discuss promising future directions for the field, in particular the connection to structured knowledge bases and the use of natural language processing models.	Semantic Scholar
Exploratory search is an increasingly important activity for Web searchers.	Semantic Scholar
However, the current search system can not provide sufficient support for exploratory search.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we made in-depth analysis for exploratory search processes, and found that there are a lot of search goal shift phenomena in exploratory search.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this fact, we have designed a new query recommendation method to support exploratory search.	Semantic Scholar
Firstly, according to the behavioral characteristics of searchers in the search goal shift processes, all the queries submitted in the search goal shift processes are extracted from search engine logs using machine learning.	Semantic Scholar
And then, we have used the queries to build a search goal shift graph; finally, the random walk algorithm is used to obtain the query recommendations in the search goal shift graph.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the method for exploratory search by comparing experiments with the other methods.	Semantic Scholar
This letter proposes a sheet-shaped force sensor for covering a robot fingertip.	Semantic Scholar
The sensor consists of flexible materials and can be adaptively designed to the shape of the fingertip.	Semantic Scholar
When a load acts on the sensor, the contact position and both normal and tangential forces can be detected.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show the sensor characteristics as follows: The contact position can be estimated in high accuracy if it is enough separated from the boundary of the sensing area, the normal force up to 4 N can be estimated independent with the contact position, and the tangential force can be estimated by calibration while the sensitivity remains to be improved.	Semantic Scholar
This letter also presents two feedback control laws of a robot finger mounted with the proposed sensor.	Semantic Scholar
One is to keep both a contact position and normal force at constant to a target object, and the other is to keep rolling contact even if the object moves while touching.	Semantic Scholar
The availability of the control laws are confirmed through motion experiments.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a novel framework for a better understanding of human cognitive locomotion and its interaction with the new tactile technologies that assist mobility and the acquisition of spatial knowledge in the absence of sight [case of visually impaired people (VIP), seniors, etc.].	Semantic Scholar
Unlike the existing mobility models, the proposed framework encompasses four elements: 1) walking with obstacle avoidance, 2) orientation, 3) spatial awareness, and 4) actual physical displacement, and is based on the concept of the tactile gist, a refreshable (dynamic) egocentric tactile representation of the perceived scene.	Semantic Scholar
The relevance of the tactile gist concept for achieving the assistance of human mobility has been evaluated with three basic original spatial experiments (homing with obstacle avoidance, localization of a passage and its size estimation, and navigation in an apartment) using a purposely designed perception-movement platform and a touch stimulating tangible wearable refreshable device.	Semantic Scholar
The collected results show that the tactile gist might be considered as a scene representation and should be integrated into an assistive device for sightless people.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach may impact the design of mobility aids for VIP as it reinforces their natural mobility skills and may lead to new mobility strategies of VIP in (un-)known environment.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel pipeline and related software tools for processing the multi-light image collections (MLICs) acquired in different application contexts to obtain shape and appearance information of captured surfaces, as well as to derive compact relightable representations of them.	Semantic Scholar
Our pipeline extends the popular Highlight Reflectance Transformation Imaging (H-RTI) framework, which is widely used in the Cultural Heritage domain.	Semantic Scholar
We support, in particular, perspective camera modeling, per-pixel interpolated light direction estimation, as well as light normalization correcting vignetting and uneven non-directional illumination.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we propose two novel easy-to-use software tools to simplify all processing steps.	Semantic Scholar
The tools, in addition to support easy processing and encoding of pixel data, implement a variety of visualizations, as well as multiple reflectance-model-fitting options.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental tests on synthetic and realworld MLICs demonstrate the usefulness of the novel algorithmic framework and the potential benefits of the proposed tools for end-user applications.	Semantic Scholar
Humans are able to robustly maintain desired motion and posture under dynamically changing circumstances, including novel conditions.	Semantic Scholar
To accomplish this, the brain needs to optimize the synergistic control between muscles against external dynamic factors.	Semantic Scholar
However, previous related studies have usually simplified the control of multiple muscles using two opposing muscles, which are minimum actuators to simulate linear feedback control.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, they have been unable to analyze how muscle synergy contributes to motion control robustness in a biological system.	Semantic Scholar
To address this issue, we considered a new muscle synergy concept used to optimize the synergy between muscle units against external dynamic conditions, including novel conditions.	Semantic Scholar
We propose that two main muscle control policies synergistically control muscle units to maintain the desired motion against external dynamic conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Our assumption is based on biological evidence regarding the control of multiple muscles via the corticospinal tract.	Semantic Scholar
One of the policies is the group control policy (GCP), which is used to control muscle group units classified based on functional similarities in joint control.	Semantic Scholar
This policy is used to effectively resist external dynamic circumstances, such as disturbances.	Semantic Scholar
The individual control policy (ICP) assists the GCP in precisely controlling motion by controlling individual muscle units.	Semantic Scholar
To validate this hypothesis, we simulated the reinforcement of the synergistic actions of the two control policies during the reinforcement learning of feedback motion control.	Semantic Scholar
Using this learning paradigm, the two control policies were synergistically combined to result in robust feedback control under novel transient and sustained disturbances that did not involve learning.	Semantic Scholar
Further, by comparing our data to experimental data generated by human subjects under the same conditions as those of the simulation, we showed that the proposed synergy concept may be used to analyze muscle synergy–driven motion control robustness in humans.	Semantic Scholar

Underwater scenes captured by cameras are plagued with poor contrast and a spectral distortion, which are the result of the scattering and absorptive properties of water.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we present a novel dehazing method that improves visibility in images and videos by detecting and segmenting image regions that contain only water.	Semantic Scholar
The colour of these regions, which we refer to as pure haze regions, is similar to the haze that is removed during the dehazing process.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we propose a semantic white balancing approach for illuminant estimation that uses the dominant colour of the water to address the spectral distortion present in underwater scenes.	Semantic Scholar
To validate the results of our method and compare them to those obtained with state-of-the-art approaches, we perform extensive subjective evaluation tests using images captured in a variety of water types and underwater videos captured onboard an underwater	Semantic Scholar
The primate visual system has an exquisite ability to discriminate partially occluded shapes.	Semantic Scholar
Recent electrophysiological recordings suggest that response dynamics in intermediate visual cortical area V4, shaped by feedback from prefrontal cortex (PFC), may play a key role.	Semantic Scholar
To probe the algorithms that may underlie these findings, we build and test a model of V4 and PFC interactions based on a hierarchical predictive coding framework.	Semantic Scholar
We propose that probabilistic inference occurs in two steps.	Semantic Scholar
Initially, V4 responses are driven solely by bottom-up sensory input and are thus strongly influenced by the level of occlusion.	Semantic Scholar
After a delay, V4 responses combine both feedforward input and feedback signals from the PFC; the latter reflect predictions made by PFC about the visual stimulus underlying V4 activity.	Semantic Scholar
We find that this model captures key features of V4 and PFC dynamics observed in experiments.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, PFC responses are strongest for occluded stimuli and delayed responses in V4 are less sensitive to occlusion, supporting our hypothesis that the feedback signals from PFC underlie robust discrimination of occluded shapes.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, our study proposes that area V4 and PFC participate in hierarchical inference, with feedback signals encoding top-down predictions about occluded shapes.	Semantic Scholar
Training a deep convolution neural network (CNN) to succeed in visual object classification usually requires a great number of examples.	Semantic Scholar
"Here, starting from such a pre-learned CNN, we study the task of extending the network to classify additional categories on the basis of only few examples (""few-shot learning"")."	Semantic Scholar
"We find that a simple and fast prototype-based learning procedure in the global feature layers (""Global Prototype Learning"", GPL) leads to some remarkably good classification results for a large portion of the new classes."	Semantic Scholar
It requires only up to ten examples for the new classes to reach a plateau in performance.	Semantic Scholar
To understand this few-shot learning performance resulting from GPL as well as the performance of the original network, we use the t-SNE method (Maaten and Hinton, 2008) to visualize clusters of object category examples.	Semantic Scholar
This reveals the strong connection between classification performance and data distribution and explains why some new categories only need few examples for learning while others resist good classification results even when trained with many more examples.	Semantic Scholar
The detection of abnormal behaviours in crowded scenes has to deal with many challenges.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents an efficient method for detection and localization of anomalies in videos.	Semantic Scholar
Using fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) and temporal data, a pre-trained supervised FCN is transferred into an unsupervised FCN ensuring the detection of (global) anomalies in scenes.	Semantic Scholar
High performance in terms of speed and accuracy is achieved by investigating the cascaded detection as a result of reducing computation complexities.	Semantic Scholar
This FCN-based architecture addresses two main tasks, feature representation and cascaded outlier detection.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on two benchmarks suggest that detection and localization of the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
Human motion retrieval from motion capture data forms the fundamental basis for computer animation.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, the authors propose an efficient human motion retrieval approach via temporal adjacent bag of words (TA-BoW) and discriminative neighborhood preserving dictionary learning (DNP-DL).	Semantic Scholar
The retrieval process includes two phases: offline training and online retrieval.	Semantic Scholar
In the first phase, the original skeleton model is first simplified and then pairwise joint distances are computed to characterize each motion frame.	Semantic Scholar
Then, a novel motion descriptor, namely TA-BoW, is proposed to discriminatively code the motion appearances, through which the articulated complexity and spatiotemporal dimensionality can be greatly reduced.	Semantic Scholar
Subsequently, by considering the neighborhood relationships of intraclass structure and the advantage of Fisher criterion, a DNP-DL method is exploited through which each human action can be discriminatively and sparsely represented by a linear combination of such dictionary atoms.	Semantic Scholar
In the second phase, a hierarchical retrieval mechanism is used by incorporating the sparse classification and chi-square ranking, whereby the searching range is significantly reduced.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results show that the proposed human motion retrieval approach performs better than the state-of-the-art competing approaches.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a descriptor for human whole-body actions based on motion coordination.	Semantic Scholar
We exploit the principle, well known in neuromechanics, that humans move their joints in a coordinated fashion.	Semantic Scholar
Our coordination-based descriptor (CODE) is computed by two main steps.	Semantic Scholar
The first step is to identify the most informative joints which characterize the motion.	Semantic Scholar
The second step enriches the descriptor considering minimum and maximum joint velocities and the correlations between the most informative joints.	Semantic Scholar
In order to compute the distances between action descriptors, we propose a novel correlation-based similarity measure.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of CODE is tested on two public datasets, namely HDM05 and Berkeley MHAD, and compared with state-of-the-art approaches, showing recognition results.	Semantic Scholar
We consider the problem of sorting a swarm of labeled robots in Euclidean space.	Semantic Scholar
Our goal is to organize the robots into a sorted and equally-spaced straight line between the robots with lowest and highest labels, while maintaining a connected communication network.	Semantic Scholar
We break the symmetry between the minimum and maximum, in order to keep time, travel distance, and communication costs low, without using central control.	Semantic Scholar
We run in parallel a set of functions, including leader election, tree formation, path formation, path modification, and geometric straightening.	Semantic Scholar
We show that our algorithm is safe, correct, efficient, and robust to changes in population and connectivity.	Semantic Scholar
We validate our theoretical results with simulations.	Semantic Scholar
Our implementation uses messages of fixed size and robots of constant memory, and is a practical solution for large populations of low-cost robots.	Semantic Scholar
Graph-based clustering methods perform clustering on a fixed input data graph.	Semantic Scholar
Thus such clustering results are sensitive to the particular graph construction.	Semantic Scholar
If this initial construction is of low quality, the resulting clustering may also be of low quality.	Semantic Scholar
We address this drawback by allowing the data graph itself to be adaptively adjusted in the clustering procedure.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, our proposed weight adaptive Laplacian (WAL) method learns a new data similarity matrix that can adaptively adjust the initial graph according to the similarity weight in the input data graph.	Semantic Scholar
We develop three versions of these methods based on the L2-norm, fuzzy entropy regularizer, and another exponential-based weight strategy, that yield three new graph-based clustering objectives.	Semantic Scholar
We derive optimization algorithms to solve these objectives.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on synthetic data sets and real-world benchmark data sets exhibit the effectiveness of these new graph-based clustering methods.	Semantic Scholar
This work presents a commitment-based agent typing system.	Semantic Scholar
Type checking is done dynamically when an agent enacts a commitment-based protocol role: verification checks if the agent meets the requirements displayed by the role it means to enact.	Semantic Scholar
An example implementation in the 2COMM4JADE framework is provided.	Semantic Scholar
2COMM4JADE is based on the Agent and Artifact meta-model and exploits JADE and CArtAgO, by using CArtAgO artifacts in order to reify commitment protocols.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we address the problem of classifying human activities that are typical in a daily living environment from videos.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel method based on Riemannian manifolds that uses a tree structure of two layers, where nodes in each tree branch are on a Riemannian manifold.	Semantic Scholar
Each node corresponds to different part-based covariance features, and induces a geodesic-based kernel machine for classification.	Semantic Scholar
In the first layer, activities are classified according to the dynamics of body pose and the movement of hands or arms.	Semantic Scholar
Activities with similar body pose and motion but different human-object interaction are coarsely classified into the same category.	Semantic Scholar
In the second layer, the coarsely classified activities are further fine classified, according to the appearance of local image patches at hands in key frames.	Semantic Scholar
This is based on the observation that interacting objects as discriminative cues are likely to be attached to hands.	Semantic Scholar
The main novelties of this paper include: (i) Motion of body parts for each video activity is characterized by global features.	Semantic Scholar
More specifically, the features are distances between each pair of key points and the orientations of lines that connect them; (ii) Human-object interaction is described by local features.	Semantic Scholar
That is, the appearance of local regions around hands in key frames, where key frames are selected using the proximity of hands to other key points; (iii) Classification of human activities is formulated by a geodesic distance-induced kernel machine.	Semantic Scholar
This is done by exploiting pairwise geodesics on Riemannian manifolds under the log-Euclidean metric.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments were conducted on 2 video datasets.	Semantic Scholar
The first dataset, made on our university campus, contains 8 activities with a total number of 943 videos.	Semantic Scholar
The second dataset is from a publicly available dataset, containing 7 activity classes and a total of 224 videos.	Semantic Scholar
Our test results on the first video dataset have shown high classification accuracy (average 94.27%), and small false alarm rate (average 0.80%).	Semantic Scholar
For the second video dataset, test results from the proposed method are compared with 6 existing methods.	Semantic Scholar

The current paper introduces a novel Dynamic Deep Bottleneck Neural Network to analyze and extract three main features of videos regarding the expression of emotions on the face.	Semantic Scholar
These main features are identity, emotion and expression intensity that are laid in three different sub-manifolds of one nonlinear general manifold.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed model enjoying the advantages of recurrent networks was used to analyze the sequence and dynamics of information in videos.	Semantic Scholar
It is noteworthy to mention that this model also has also the potential to synthesize new videos showing variations of one specific emotion on the face of unknown subjects.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on discrimination and recognition ability of extracted components showed that the proposed model has an average of 97.77% accuracy in recognition of six prominent emotions (Fear, Surprise, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Happiness), and 78.17% accuracy in the recognition of intensity.

The produced videos revealed variations from neutral to the apex of an emotion on the face of the unfamiliar test subject which is on average 0.8 similar to reference videos in the scale of the SSIM method.	Semantic Scholar
Haptic interfaces are mechatronic devices designed to render tactile sensations; although they are typically based on robotic manipulators external to the human body, recently, interesting wearable solutions have been presented.	Semantic Scholar
Toward a more realistic feeling of virtual and remote environment interactions, we propose a novel wearable skin stretch device for the upper limb called “hBracelet.” It consists of two main parts coupled with a linear actuator.	Semantic Scholar
Each part contains two servo actuators that move a belt.	Semantic Scholar
The device is capable of providing distributed mechanotactile stimulation on the arm by controlling the tension and the distance of the two belts in contact with the skin.	Semantic Scholar
When the motors spin in opposite directions, the belt presses into the user's arm, while when they spin in the same direction, the belt applies a shear force to the skin.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the linear actuator exerts longitudinal cues on the arm by moving the two parts of the device.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we illustrate the mechanical structure, working principle, and control strategies of the proposed wearable haptic display.	Semantic Scholar
We also present a qualitative experiment in a teleoperation scenario as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed haptic interface and to show how a human can take advantage of multiple haptic stimuli provided at the same time and on the same body area.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that the device is capable of successfully providing information about forces acting at the remote site, thus, improving telepresence.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation and positioning are very important aspects of computer aided engineering.	Semantic Scholar
To process these two, we can apply traditional methods or intelligent techniques.	Semantic Scholar
The difference between them is in the way they process information.	Semantic Scholar
In the first case, to simulate an object in a particular state of action, we need to perform an entire process to read values of parameters.	Semantic Scholar
It is not very convenient for objects for which simulation takes a long time, i.e.	Semantic Scholar
when mathematical calculations are complicated.	Semantic Scholar
In the second case, an intelligent solution can efficiently help on devoted way of simulation, which enables us to simulate the object only in a situation that is necessary for a development process.	Semantic Scholar
We would like to present research results on developed intelligent simulation and control model of electric drive engine vehicle.	Semantic Scholar
For a dedicated simulation method based on intelligent computation, where evolutionary strategy is simulating the states of the dynamic model, an intelligent system based on devoted neural network is introduced to control co-working modules while motion is in time interval.	Semantic Scholar
Presented experimental results show implemented solution in situation when a vehicle transports things over area with many obstacles, what provokes sudden changes in stability that may lead to destruction of load.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, applied neural network controller prevents the load from destruction by positioning characteristics like pressure, acceleration, and stiffness voltage to absorb the adverse changes of the ground.	Semantic Scholar

We present an object relighting system that allows an artist to select an object from an image and insert it into a target scene.	Semantic Scholar
Through simple interactions, the system can adjust illumination on the inserted object so that it appears naturally in the scene.	Semantic Scholar
To support image-based relighting, we build object model from the image, and propose a perceptually-inspired approximate shading model for the relighting.	Semantic Scholar
It decomposes the shading field into (a) a rough shape term that can be reshaded, (b) a parametric shading detail that encodes missing features from the first term, and (c) a geometric detail term that captures fine-scale material properties.	Semantic Scholar
With this decomposition, the shading model combines 3D rendering and image-based composition and allows more flexible compositing than image-based methods.	Semantic Scholar
Quantitative evaluation and a set of user studies suggest our method is a promising alternative to existing methods of object insertion.	Semantic Scholar
We present a relevance feedback based browsing methodology using different representations for time series data.	Semantic Scholar
The outperforming representation type, e.g., among dual-tree complex wavelet transformation, Fourier, symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX), is learned based on user annotations of the presented query results with representation feedback.	Semantic Scholar
We present the use of autoencoder type neural networks to summarize time series or its representations into sparse vectors, which serves as another representation learned from the data.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on 85 real data sets confirm that diversity in the result set increases precision, representation feedback incorporates item diversity and helps to identify the appropriate representation.	Semantic Scholar
The results also illustrate that the autoencoders can enhance the base representations, and achieve comparably accurate results with reduced data sizes.	Semantic Scholar
This investigation takes the first step toward characterizing autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) behavior trying to perform station keeping using bioinspired thrusters under the influence of disturbances with multiple amplitudes and frequencies.	Semantic Scholar
We describe the similarities between periodic disturbance rejection and the frequency response of the AUV performing oscillating maneuvers, and the significance of maneuvering regimes previously identified for this type of propulsion.	Semantic Scholar
We measured the exact position/orientation of the AUV using an underwater motion capture system and provide position data to the AUV controller in real time for feedback control.	Semantic Scholar
A wave disturbance generator was developed for this study in order to characterize the vehicle tracking performance in the presence of both high-amplitude low-frequency disturbances and low-amplitude high-frequency disturbances.	Semantic Scholar
The bioinspired maneuvering technique is demonstrated to provide adequate control capabilities for both types of disturbances maintaining in all cases position errors less than half the vehicle diameter, and proved especially adept at compensating for low-amplitude high-frequency disturbances, which can be difficult to overcome using traditional marine thrusters.

Cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as automotive systems, are starting to include sophisticated machine learning (ML) components.	Semantic Scholar
Their correctness, therefore, depends on properties of the inner ML modules.	Semantic Scholar
While learning algorithms aim to generalize from examples, they are only as good as the examples provided, and recent efforts have shown that they can produce inconsistent output under small adversarial perturbations.	Semantic Scholar
This raises the question: can the output from learning components lead to a failure of the entire CPS?	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we address this question by formulating it as a problem of falsifying signal temporal logic specifications for CPS with ML components.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a compositional falsification framework where a temporal logic falsifier and a machine learning analyzer cooperate with the aim of finding falsifying executions of the considered model.	Semantic Scholar
The efficacy of the proposed technique is shown on an automatic emergency braking system model with a perception component based on deep neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
Establishing a-priori mission performance guarantees is crucial if autonomous robots are to be used with confidence in missions where failure could incur high costs in life and property damage.	Semantic Scholar
Automatic mission software verification, in addition to simulation and experimental benchmarking, is a key component of the solution for establishing performance guarantees.	Semantic Scholar
This component requires automatically verifying that the software constructed by the mission designer when executed in a partially known environment will adhere to the performance guarantee.	Semantic Scholar
In prior work we developed VIPARS, a unique approach to verifying performance guarantees for autonomous behavior-based robot software based on a combination of static analysis and Bayesian networks.	Semantic Scholar
While that approach produced fast and accurate verification of single robot missions with robot motion uncertainty, it did not address multiple-robot missions or any form of uncertainty related to environment geometry.	Semantic Scholar
This paper addresses the challenges involved in building a software tool for verifying the behavior of a multi-robot waypoint mission that includes uncertainly located obstacles and uncertain environment geometry as well as uncertainty in robot motion.	Semantic Scholar

This paper introduces and validates the performance of an alternative input device for people with limited hand/arm movement and control.	Semantic Scholar
A summary is provided of the current state of the art in alternative input devices.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this, a low-cost solution is proposed that allows for 1) low latency and high operating speed and accuracy, 2) use from different viewing angles without recalibration, and 3) the ability to seamlessly control multiple devices.	Semantic Scholar
A prototype of this system was built and tested to determine the accuracy of the system (using a pan–tilt system), and to analyze the performance of the system compared to the state of the art (through user tests, based on the ISO 9241–411 test).	Semantic Scholar
The proposed system allows for great accuracy ( $\sigma _X=\text{0.28 px}, \sigma _Y=\text{0.29 px}, \sigma _{XY}=\text{0.02 px}$), a decent performance compared to the state of the art (throughput = 1.52 bits/s, error rate = 31%), and good results in the ISO 9241-411 independent rating scale.

Web search engines are composed by thousands of query processing nodes, i.e., servers dedicated to process user queries.	Semantic Scholar
Such many servers consume a significant amount of energy, mostly accountable to their CPUs, but they are necessary to ensure low latencies, since users expect sub-second response times (e.g., 500 ms).	Semantic Scholar

One of the fundamental properties of a salient object region is its contrast with the immediate context.	Semantic Scholar
The problem is that numerous object regions exist which potentially can all be salient.	Semantic Scholar
One way to prevent an exhaustive search over all object regions is by using object proposal algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
These return a limited set of regions which are most likely to contain an object.	Semantic Scholar
Several saliency estimation methods have used object proposals.	Semantic Scholar
However, they focus on the saliency of the proposal only, and the importance of its immediate context has not been evaluated.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we aim to improve salient object detection.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we extend object proposal methods with context proposals, which allow to incorporate the immediate context in the saliency computation.	Semantic Scholar
We propose several saliency features which are computed from the context proposals.	Semantic Scholar
In the experiments, we evaluate five object proposal methods for the task of saliency segmentation, and find that Multiscale Combinatorial Grouping outperforms the others.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, experiments show that the proposed context features improve performance, and that our method matches results on the FT datasets and obtains competitive results on three other datasets (PASCAL-S, MSRA-B and ECSSD).	Semantic Scholar

These motivate us to address the problem of distributed top-k dominating query processing.	Semantic Scholar
We propose an efficient decentralized algorithm that exploits virtual points and returns the exact answer.	Semantic Scholar
The virtual points are utilized to focus on the data space to be preferentially searched and also to limit the search space to prune unnecessary computation and data forwarding.	Semantic Scholar

Several classification experiments are conducted over publicly available traffic sign datasets from Germany and Belgium using a Deep Neural Network which comprises Convolutional layers and Spatial Transformer Networks.	Semantic Scholar
Such trials are built to measure the impact of diverse factors with the end goal of designing a Convolutional Neural Network that can improve the state-of-the-art of traffic sign classification task.	Semantic Scholar
First, different adaptive and non-adaptive stochastic gradient descent optimisation algorithms such as SGD, SGD-Nesterov, RMSprop and Adam are evaluated.	Semantic Scholar
Subsequently, multiple combinations of Spatial Transformer Networks placed at distinct positions within the main neural network are analysed.	Semantic Scholar
The recognition rate of the proposed Convolutional Neural Network reports an accuracy of 99.71% in the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods and also being more efficient in terms of memory requirements.	Semantic Scholar
This paper addresses the problem of finite-time synchronization of stochastic coupled neural networks (SCNNs) subject to Markovian switching, mixed time delay, and actuator saturation.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, coupling strengths of the SCNNs are characterized by mutually independent random variables.	Semantic Scholar
By utilizing a simple linear transformation, the problem of stochastic finite-time synchronization of SCNNs is converted into a mean-square finite-time stabilization problem of an error system.	Semantic Scholar
By choosing a suitable mode dependent switched Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, a new set of sufficient conditions is derived to guarantee the finite-time stability of the error system.	Semantic Scholar
Subsequently, with the help of anti-windup control scheme, the actuator saturation risks could be mitigated.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the derived conditions help to optimize estimation of the domain of attraction by enlarging the contractively invariant set.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, simulations are conducted to exhibit the efficiency of proposed control scheme.	Semantic Scholar
Bag of Words (BoW) model and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are two milestones in visual recognition.	Semantic Scholar

Particularly, the max-pooling has been validated as an efficient and effective pooling method compared with other methods such as average pooling and stochastic pooling.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we first evaluate different pooling methods, and then propose a new feature pooling method termed as selective, discriminative and equalizing pooling (SDE).	Semantic Scholar
The SDE representation is a feature learning mechanism by jointly optimizing the pooled representations with the target of learning more selective, discriminative and equalizing features.	Semantic Scholar
We use bilevel optimization to solve the joint optimization problem.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on seven benchmark datasets (including both single-label and multi-label ones) well validate the effectiveness of our framework.	Semantic Scholar

However, previously trained semantic segmentation models showed unacceptable performance after significant changes to the camera orientations and the lighting conditions.	Semantic Scholar
To avoid time-consuming hand labeling, we explore and evaluate the use of data augmentation techniques, specifically skew and gamma correction, from a practical real-world standpoint to extend the existing model and provide more robust performance.	Semantic Scholar

Research of social recommendation aims at exploiting social information to improve the quality of a recommender system.	Semantic Scholar
It can be further divided into two classes.	Semantic Scholar
Explicit social recommendation assumes the existence of not only the users’ ratings on items, but also the explicit social connections between users.	Semantic Scholar
Implicit social recommendation assumes the availability of only the ratings but not the social connections between users, and attempts to infer implicit social connections between users with the goal to boost recommendation accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a unified framework that is applicable to both explicit and implicit social recommendation.	Semantic Scholar
We propose an optimization framework to learn the degree of social correlation and rating prediction jointly, so these two tasks can mutually boost the performance of each other.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, a well-known challenge for implicit social recommendation is that it takes quadratic time to learn the strength of pairwise connections.	Semantic Scholar
This paper further proposes several practical tricks to reduce the complexity of our model to be linear to the observed ratings.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments show that the proposed model, with only two parameters, can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art solutions for both explicit and implicit social recommender systems.	Semantic Scholar
Robot-assisted deployment of fenestrated stent grafts in fenestrated endovascular aortic repair (FEVAR) requires accurate geometrical alignment.	Semantic Scholar
Currently, this process is guided by two-dimensional (2-D) fluoroscopy, which is insufficiently informative and error prone.	Semantic Scholar

Experiments including 13 able-bodied and three amputee subjects were carried out to evaluate both offline classification accuracy (CA) and online performance of the forearm motion recognition system based on three types of sensors (EMG-only, NIRS-only, and hybrid EMG-NIRS).	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results showed that both the offline CA and real-time performance for controlling a virtual prosthetic hand were significantly (p $<$  0.05) improved by combining EMG and NIRS.	Semantic Scholar
These findings suggest that fusion of EMG and NIRS is feasible to improve the control of upper-limb prostheses, without increasing the number of sensor nodes or complexity of signal processing.	Semantic Scholar

Pneumatic muscles are mostly constructed out of flexible membranes and are implemented in a wide range of robotic applications.	Semantic Scholar
In these soft materials, perforations are often caused by overpressuring of the muscles and wear.	Semantic Scholar
In many cases, this leads to limited numbers of actuation cycles.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, pleated pneumatic artificial muscles were developed, whose membrane is constructed out of self-healing polymer.	Semantic Scholar
This allows for the complete healing of microscopic and macroscopic damages through a mild heat treatment.	Semantic Scholar
Two prototypes were designed, manufactured, and experimentally characterized.	Semantic Scholar
The self-healing was validated by repairing large realistic cuts in the muscle membrane completely.	Semantic Scholar
Even when repeatedly damaging and healing the muscles, the mechanical properties were recovered in a reversible and repeatable fashion through the self-healing procedure.	Semantic Scholar
On the basis of the neurophysiological strength-duration (amplitude-duration) curve of neuron activation (which relates the threshold amplitude of a rectangular current pulse of neuron activation to the pulse duration), as well as with the use of activation energy constraint (the threshold curve corresponds to the energy threshold of neuron activation by a rectangular current pulse), an energy model of neuron activation by a single current pulse has been constructed.	Semantic Scholar
The constructed model of activation, which determines its spectral properties, is a bandpass filter.	Semantic Scholar
Under the condition of minimum-phase feature of the neuron activation model, on the basis of Hilbert transform, the possibilities of phase-frequency response calculation from its amplitude-frequency response have been considered.	Semantic Scholar
Approximation to the amplitude-frequency response by the response of the Butterworth filter of the first order, as well as obtaining the pulse response corresponding to this approximation, give us the possibility of analyzing the efficiency of activating current pulses of various shapes, including analysis in accordance with the energy constraint.

Setup times commonly exist in many flexible manufacturing lines to adjust tools and carry out safety and quality check during product changeovers.	Semantic Scholar

An aggregation-based recursive procedure is introduced to evaluate system performance.	Semantic Scholar
The convergence of the procedure is proved analytically and the accuracy is justified numerically.	Semantic Scholar
Using such a method, the impact of setups is analyzed and the effectiveness of downtime and setup time reduction is investigated.	Semantic Scholar
Indicators are derived to identify the setup bottlenecks with respect to machine and product type, whose setup time reduction can lead to the largest improvement in line production rate.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, an application study at a furniture manufacturing plant is introduced.	Semantic Scholar
This paper seeks insight into stabilization mechanisms for periodic walking gaits in 3D bipedal robots.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this insight, a control strategy based on virtual constraints, which imposes coordination between joints rather than a temporal evolution, will be proposed for achieving asymptotic convergence toward a periodic motion.	Semantic Scholar
For planar bipeds with one degree of underactuation, it is known that a vertical displacement of the center of mass—with downward velocity at the step transition— induces stability of a walking gait.	Semantic Scholar
This paper concerns the qualitative extension of this type of property to 3D walking with two degrees of underactuation.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown that a condition on the position of the center of mass in the horizontal plane at the transition between steps induces synchronization between the motions in the sagittal and frontal planes.	Semantic Scholar
A combination of the conditions for self-synchronization and vertical oscillations leads to stable gaits.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm for self-stabilization of 3D walking gaits is first developed for a simplified model of a walking robot (an inverted pendulum with variable length legs), and then it is extended to a complex model of the humanoid robot Romeo using the notion of Hybrid Zero Dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
Simulations of the model of the robot illustrate the efficacy of the method and its robustness.	Semantic Scholar
In recent years, a clear trend toward simplification emerged in the development of robotic hands.	Semantic Scholar
The use of soft robotic approaches has been a useful tool in this prospective, enabling complexity reduction by embodying part of grasping intelligence in the hand mechanical structure.	Semantic Scholar
Several hand prototypes designed according to such principles have accomplished good results in terms of grasping simplicity, robustness, and reliability.	Semantic Scholar
Among them, the Pisa/IIT SoftHand demonstrated the feasibility of a large variety of grasping tasks, by means of only one actuator and an opportunely designed tendon-driven differential mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
However, the use of a single degree of actuation prevents the execution of more complex tasks, like fine preshaping of fingers and in-hand manipulation.	Semantic Scholar
While possible in theory, simply doubling the Pisa/IIT SoftHand actuation system has several disadvantages, e.g., in terms of space and mechanical complexity.	Semantic Scholar
To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel design framework for tendon-driven mechanisms, in which the main idea is to turn transmission friction from a disturbance into a design tool.	Semantic Scholar
In this way, the degrees of actuation (DoAs) can be doubled with little additional complexity.	Semantic Scholar
By leveraging on this idea, we design a novel robotic hand, the Pisa/IIT SoftHand 2.	Semantic Scholar
We present here its design, modeling, control, and experimental validation.	Semantic Scholar
The hand demonstrates that by opportunely combining only two DoAs with hand softness, a large variety of grasping and manipulation tasks can be performed, only relying on the intelligence embodied in the mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
Examples include rotating objects with different shapes, opening a jar, and pouring coffee from a glass.	Semantic Scholar
Today, Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) still have a lowmarket share in logistics, compared to manual forklifts.	Semantic Scholar
We identified one of the main bottlenecks in the rather long deployment time which involves precise 2D mapping of the plant, 3D geo-referencing of pick-up/ drop positions and the manual design of the roadmap.	Semantic Scholar
The long deployment time has various reasons: in state-of-the-art plant installations, designated infrastructure is still necessary for the localization; themappingprocess requires highly skilled personnel; inmany cases unavailable or inappropriate position information of drop points for goodsmust be corrected on site.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the design of the roadmap, performed by expert technicians is manually optimised in a tedious process to achieve maximum flow of goods for the plant operator.	Semantic Scholar
In total the setup of a plant to be ready for AGV operation is taking several months, binding highly skilled technicians and involves very time-consuming and costly on-site procedures.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we present an approach to AGV deployment which aims to drastically reduce the time, cost and involved personnel.	Semantic Scholar
First, we propose the employment of a novel, industrial-ready SICK 3D laser scanning technology in order to build an accurate and consistent virtual representation of the whole warehouse environment.	Semantic Scholar
By utilizing suitable segmentation and processing a semantic map is generated that contains 3D geo-referenced positions as well as a 2D localization map eliminating the need for dedicated solution to 2D mapping.	Semantic Scholar
Second, the semantic map provides a free space map which is used as a basis for the automatic roadmap creation in order to achieve optimal flow.	Semantic Scholar
So, this paper proposes an innovative methodology for obtaining, in a semi-automated manner, the map of an industrial environment where a system of multiple AGVs will be installed with less time and cost.	Semantic Scholar

Despite their biological plausibility, neural network models with asymmetric weights are rarely solved analytically, and closed-form solutions are available only in some limiting cases or in some mean-field approximations.	Semantic Scholar

The network had discrete time evolution equations and binary firing rates, and it could be driven by noise with any distribution.	Semantic Scholar
We found analytical expressions of the conditional and stationary joint probability distributions of the membrane potentials and the firing rates.	Semantic Scholar
By manipulating the conditional probability distribution of the firing rates, we extend to stochastic networks the associating learning rule previously introduced by Personnaz and coworkers.	Semantic Scholar
The new learning rule allowed the safe storage, under the presence of noise, of point and cyclic attractors, with useful implications for content-addressable memories.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we studied the bifurcation structure of the network dynamics in the zero-noise limit.	Semantic Scholar
We analytically derived examples of the codimension 1 and codimension 2 bifurcation diagrams of the network, which describe how the neuronal dynamics changes with the external stimuli.	Semantic Scholar
This showed that the network may undergo transitions among multistable regimes, oscillatory behavior elicited by asymmetric synaptic connections, and various forms of spontaneous symmetry breaking.	Semantic Scholar
We also calculated analytically groupwise correlations of neural activity in the network in the stationary regime.	Semantic Scholar
This revealed neuronal regimes where, statistically, the membrane potentials and the firing rates are either synchronous or asynchronous.	Semantic Scholar

In this paper, synchronization in an array of discrete-time neural networks (DTNNs) with time-varying delays coupled by Markov jump topologies is considered.	Semantic Scholar
It is assumed that the switching information can be collected by a tracker with a certain probability and transmitted from the tracker to controller precisely.	Semantic Scholar
Then the controller selects suitable control gains based on the received switching information to synchronize the network.	Semantic Scholar
This new control scheme makes full use of received information and overcomes the shortcomings of mode-dependent and mode-independent control schemes.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the proposed control method includes both the mode-dependent and mode-independent control techniques as special cases.	Semantic Scholar
By using linear matrix inequality (LMI) method and designing new Lyapunov functionals, delay-dependent conditions are derived to guarantee that the DTNNs with Markov jump topologies to be asymptotically synchronized.	Semantic Scholar
Compared with existing results on Markov systems which are obtained by separately using mode-dependent and mode-independent methods, our result has great flexibility in practical applications.	Semantic Scholar

The principles of neural encoding and computations are inherently collective and usually involve large populations of interacting neurons with highly correlated activities.	Semantic Scholar
While theories of neural function have long recognized the importance of collective effects in populations of neurons, only in the past two decades has it become possible to record from many cells simultaneously using advanced experimental techniques with single-spike resolution and to relate these correlations to function and behavior.

This letter examines shape sensing for a new class of surgical robot that consists of parallel flexible structures that can be reconfigured inside the human body.	Semantic Scholar
Known as continuum reconfigurable incisionless surgical parallel (CRISP) robots, these devices provide access to the human body through needle-sized entry points, yet can be configured into trusslike structures capable of dexterous movement and large force application.	Semantic Scholar
They can also be reconfigured as needed during a surgical procedure.	Semantic Scholar
Since CRISP robots are elastic, they will deform when subjected to external forces or other perturbations.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we explore how to combine sensor information with mechanics-based models for CRISP robots to estimate their shapes under applied loads.	Semantic Scholar
The end result is a shape sensing framework for CRISP robots that will enable future research on control under applied loads, autonomous motion, force sensing, and other robot behaviors.	Semantic Scholar
Monocular optical flow has been widely used to detect obstacles in Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) during visual navigation.	Semantic Scholar
However, this approach requires significant movement, which reduces the efficiency of navigation and may even introduce risks in narrow spaces.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we introduce a novel setup of self-supervised learning (SSL), in which optical flow cues serve as a scaffold to learn the visual appearance of obstacles in the environment.	Semantic Scholar
We apply it to a landing task, in which initially ‘surface roughness’ is estimated from the optical flow field in order to detect obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
Subsequently, a linear regression function is learned that maps appearance features represented by texton distributions to the roughness estimate.	Semantic Scholar
After learning, the MAV can detect obstacles by just analyzing a still image.	Semantic Scholar
This allows the MAV to search for a landing spot without moving.	Semantic Scholar
We first demonstrate this principle to work with offline tests involving images captured from an on-board camera, and then demonstrate the principle in flight.	Semantic Scholar
Although surface roughness is a property of the entire flow field in the global image, the appearance learning even allows for the pixel-wise segmentation of obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a learning-based quality evaluation framework for inpainted results that does not require any subjectively annotated training data.	Semantic Scholar
Image inpainting, which removes and restores unwanted regions in images, is widely acknowledged as a task whose results are quite difficult to evaluate objectively.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, existing learning-based image quality assessment (IQA) methods for inpainting require subjectively annotated data for training.	Semantic Scholar
However, subjective annotation requires huge cost and subjects’ judgment occasionally differs from person to person in accordance with the judgment criteria.	Semantic Scholar
To overcome these difficulties, the proposed framework generates and uses simulated failure results of inpainted images whose subjective qualities are controlled as the training data.	Semantic Scholar
We also propose a masking method for generating training data towards fully automated training data generation.	Semantic Scholar
These approaches make it possible to successfully estimate better inpainted images, even though the task is quite subjective.	Semantic Scholar
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we test our algorithm with various datasets and show it outperforms existing IQA methods for inpainting.	Semantic Scholar

Traffic volume estimation at the city scale is an important problem useful to many transportation operations and urban applications.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a hybrid framework that integrates both state-of-art machine learning techniques and well-established traffic flow theory to estimate citywide traffic volume.	Semantic Scholar
In addition to typical urban context features extracted from multiple sources, we extract a special set of features from GPS trajectories based on the implications of traffic flow theory, which provide extra information on the speed-flow relationship.	Semantic Scholar
Using the network-wide speed information estimated from a travel speed estimation model, a volume related high level feature is first learned using an unsupervised graphical model.	Semantic Scholar
A volume re-interpretation model is then introduced to map the volume related high level feature to the predicted volume using a small amount of ground truth data for training.	Semantic Scholar
The framework is evaluated using a GPS trajectory dataset from 33,000 Beijing taxis and volume ground truth data obtained from 4,980 video clips.	Semantic Scholar
The results demonstrate effectiveness and potential of the proposed framework in citywide traffic volume estimation.	Semantic Scholar
We present an overview of the integration of constraint programming (CP) and operations research (OR) to solve combinatorial optimization problems.	Semantic Scholar
We interpret CP and OR as relying on a common primal-dual solution approach that provides the basis for integration using four main strategies.	Semantic Scholar
The first strategy tightly interweaves propagation from CP and relaxation from OR in a single solver.	Semantic Scholar
The second applies OR techniques to domain filtering in CP.	Semantic Scholar
The third decomposes the problem into a portion solved by CP and a portion solved by OR, using CP-based column generation or logic-based Benders decomposition.	Semantic Scholar
The fourth uses relaxed decision diagrams developed for CP propagation to help solve dynamic programming models in OR.	Semantic Scholar
The paper cites a significant fraction of the literature on CP/OR integration and concludes with future perspectives.	Semantic Scholar
Many variants of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm have been proposed for registering point clouds.	Semantic Scholar
This paper explores the performance of 20,736 ICP variants applied to the registration of point clouds for the purpose of terrain mapping, using data obtained from a mobile platform.	Semantic Scholar
The methodology of the study has involved taking sequences of 100 consecutive scans at three distinct scenes along the route of a mining haul truck operating in a typical surface mining environment.	Semantic Scholar
The scan sequences were obtained at 20 Hz from a Velodyne HDL-64E mounted on the truck.	Semantic Scholar
The aim is to understand how well the ICP variants perform in consolidating these scans into sub-maps.	Semantic Scholar
Variants are compared against three metrics: accuracy, precision, and relative computational cost.	Semantic Scholar
The main finding of the paper is that none of the variants is simultaneously accurate, precise, and fast to compute, across all three scenes.	Semantic Scholar
The best performing variants employed strategies that filtered the data sets, used local surface geometry in the form normals, and used the distance between points in one point cloud to a corresponding surface from a reference point cloud as a measure of the fit between two point clouds.	Semantic Scholar
The significance of this work is that it: (i) provides guidance in the construction of ICP variants for terrain mapping; and (ii) identifies the significant limitations of existing ICP variants for this application.	Semantic Scholar

Community question answering (cQA) has become an important issue due to the popularity of cQA archives on the Web.	Semantic Scholar
This paper focuses on addressing the lexical gap problem in question retrieval.	Semantic Scholar
Question retrieval in cQA archives aims to find the existing questions that are semantically equivalent or relevant to the queried questions.	Semantic Scholar
However, the lexical gap problem brings a new challenge for question retrieval in cQA.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose to model and learn distributed word representations with metadata of category information within cQA pages for question retrieval using two novel category powered models.	Semantic Scholar
One is a basic category powered model called MB-NET and the other one is an enhanced category powered model called ME-NET which can better learn the distributed word representations and alleviate the lexical gap problem.	Semantic Scholar
To deal with the variable size of word representation vectors, we employ the framework of fisher kernel to transform them into the fixed-length vectors.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on large-scale English and Chinese cQA data sets show that our proposed approaches can significantly outperform state-of-the-art retrieval models for question retrieval in cQA.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we further conduct our approaches on large-scale automatic evaluation experiments.	Semantic Scholar
The evaluation results show that promising and significant performance improvements can be achieved.	Semantic Scholar
There is a rising demand for multiple-cable controlled robots in stadiums or warehouses due to its low cost, longer operation time, and higher safety standards.	Semantic Scholar
In a cluttered environment, the cables can wrap around obstacles, but careful choice needs to be made for the initial cable configurations to ensure that the workspace of the robot is optimized.	Semantic Scholar
The presence of cables makes it imperative to consider the homotopy classes of the cables both in the design and motion planning problems.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we study the problem of workspace planning for multiple-cable controlled robots in an environment with polygonal obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
This letter's goal is to establish a relationship between the boundary of the workspace and cable configurations of such robots and solve related optimization and motion planning problems.	Semantic Scholar
We first analyze the conditions under which a configuration of a cable-controlled robot can be considered valid, discuss the relationship between cable configuration, the robot's workspace and its motion state, and using graph search based motion planning in $h$ -augmented graph perform workspace optimization and compute optimal paths for the robot.

Despite the longtime research aimed at retrieving geometrical information of an object from polarimetric imaging, physical limitations in the polarisation phenomena constrain current approaches to provide ambiguous depth estimation.	Semantic Scholar
As an additional constraint, polarimetric imaging formulation differs when light is reflected off the object specularly or diffusively.	Semantic Scholar
This introduces another source of ambiguity that current formulations cannot overcome.	Semantic Scholar
With the aim of deriving a formulation capable of dealing with as many heterogeneous effects as possible, we propose a differential formulation of the Shape from Polarisation problem that depends only on polarimetric images.	Semantic Scholar
This allows the direct geometrical characterisation of the level-set of the object keeping consistent mathematical formulation for diffuse and specular reflection.	Semantic Scholar
We show via synthetic and real-world experiments that diffuse and specular reflection can be easily distinguished in order to extract meaningful geometrical features from just polarimetric imaging.	Semantic Scholar
The inherent ambiguity of the Shape from Polarization problem becomes evident through the impossibility of reconstructing the whole surface with this differential approach.	Semantic Scholar
To overcome this limitation, we consider shading information elegantly embedding this new formulation into a two-light calibrated photometric stereo approach..	Semantic Scholar
Recently, ordinal regression, which predicts categories of ordinal scale, has received considerable attention.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a new approach to solve ordinal regression problems within the learning vector quantization framework.	Semantic Scholar
It extends the previous approach termed ordinal generalized matrix learning vector quantization with a more suitable and natural cost function, leading to more intuitive parameter update rules.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, in our approach the bandwidth of the prototype weights is automatically adapted.	Semantic Scholar
Empirical investigation on a number of datasets reveals that overall the proposed approach tends to have superior out-of-sample performance, when compared to alternative ordinal regression methods.	Semantic Scholar
The study of broken-triangles is becoming increasingly ambitious, by both solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) in polynomial time and reducing search space size through either value merging or variable elimination.	Semantic Scholar
Considerable progress has been made in extending this important concept, such as dual broken-triangle and weakly broken-triangle, in order to maximize the number of captured tractable CSP instances and/or the number of merged values.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, m-wBTP allows us to merge more values than BTP.	Semantic Scholar
DBTP, ∀∃-BTP, k-BTP, WBTP and m-wBTP permit us to capture more tractable instances than BTP.	Semantic Scholar
However, except BTP, none of these extensions allows variable elimination while preserving satisfiability.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, k-BTP and m-wBTP define bigger tractable classes around BTP but both of them generally need a high level of consistency.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we introduce a new weaker form of BTP, called m-fBTP for flexible broken-triangle property, which will represent a compromise between most of these previous tractable properties based on BTP.	Semantic Scholar
m-fBTP allows us on the one hand to eliminate more variables than BTP while preserving satisfiability and on the other to define a new bigger tractable class for which arc consistency is a decision procedure.	Semantic Scholar
Likewise, m-fBTP permits to merge more values than BTP but fewer than m-wBTP.	Semantic Scholar
The binary CSP instances satisfying m-fBTP are solved by algorithms of the state-of-the-art like MAC and RFL in polynomial time.	Semantic Scholar
An open question is whether it is possible to compute, in polynomial time, the existence of some variable ordering for which a given instance satisfies m-fBTP.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a novel game-theoretical autonomous decision-making framework to address a task allocation problem for a swarm of multiple agents.	Semantic Scholar
We consider cooperation of self-interested agents, and show that our proposed decentralized algorithm guarantees convergence of agents with social inhibition to a Nash stable partition (i.e., social agreement) within polynomial time.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm is simple and executable based on local interactions with neighbor agents under a strongly connected communication network and even in asynchronous environments.	Semantic Scholar
We analytically present a mathematical formulation for computing the lower bound of suboptimality of the outcome, and additionally show that at least 50% of suboptimality can be guaranteed if social utilities are nondecreasing functions with respect to the number of coworking agents.

Distant supervision for neural relation extraction is an efficient approach to extracting massive relations with reference to plain texts.	Semantic Scholar
However, the existing neural methods fail to capture the critical words in sentence encoding and meanwhile lack useful sentence information for some positive training instances.	Semantic Scholar
To address the above issues, we propose a novel neural relation extraction model.	Semantic Scholar
First, we develop a word-level attention mechanism to distinguish the importance of each individual word in a sentence, increasing the attention weights for those critical words.	Semantic Scholar
Second, we investigate the semantic information from word embeddings of target entities, which can be developed as a supplementary feature for the extractor.	Semantic Scholar

In this letter, we report a miniature swimming robot that consists of a nonmagnetic V-shaped head, an I-shaped tail attached with a magnet and a flexible link for interconnection of the rigid head and tail.	Semantic Scholar
The use of a flexible link enables the robot to exhibit two different vibration modes by tuning the input frequencies of the applied oscillating magnetic field with uniform field strength.	Semantic Scholar
When the input frequency is below 15 Hz, the head and tail show similar and large vibration amplitudes, and the net centrifugal force mainly contributes to the forward propulsion of the robot in fluid.	Semantic Scholar
While with high input frequencies (i.e., larger than 30 Hz), the flexible link can filter away high-frequency signals to efficiently avoid the passive vibration of the nonmagnetic head.	Semantic Scholar
Simultaneously, the magnetic tail vibrates with relatively large amplitude and generates forward propulsion force for the robot.	Semantic Scholar
To understand the whole-body-vibration and tail-vibration behaviors, an analytical model has been developed.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, swimming performances of this robot, i.e., the propulsion force and swimming velocity, are characterized on the substrate–water interface.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we demonstrate two-dimensional manipulation of tiny objects by utilizing the two vibration modes of the robot.	Semantic Scholar
Neurodynamic system is an emerging research field.	Semantic Scholar
To understand the essential motivational representations of neural activity, neurodynamics is an important question in cognitive system research.	Semantic Scholar
This paper is to investigate Mittag-Leffler stability of a class of fractional-order neural networks in the presence of generalized piecewise constant arguments.	Semantic Scholar
To identify neural types of computational principles in mathematical and computational analysis, the existence and uniqueness of the solution of neurodynamic system is the first prerequisite.	Semantic Scholar
We prove that the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the network holds when some conditions are satisfied.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, self-active neurodynamic system demands stable internal dynamical states (equilibria).	Semantic Scholar
The main emphasis will be then on several sufficient conditions to guarantee a unique equilibrium point.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, to provide deeper explanations of neurodynamic process, Mittag-Leffler stability is studied in detail.	Semantic Scholar

As one of the most common user interactive behaviors in many social media services, mention plays a significant role in both user interaction and information cascading.	Semantic Scholar
While an increasing line of work has focused on analyzing the mention mechanism for information diffusion, the essential problem of mentionee recommendation from the perspective of common users, i.e., how to find mentionees (mentioned users) who are most likely to be notified by a mentioner (mentioning user) for knowing a post, has been seldom investigated.	Semantic Scholar
This paper aims to develop personalized recommendation techniques to automatically generate mentionees when a user intends to mention others in a post.	Semantic Scholar
After analyzing real-world social media datasets we observe that users' mention behaviors are influenced by not only the semantic but also the spatial context factors of their mentioning activities, which motivate the needs for spatial context-aware user mention behavior modeling.	Semantic Scholar
In light of these, we proposed a joint probabilistic model, named Spatial COntext-aware Mention behavior Model (SCOMM), to simulate the process of generating users' location-tagged mentioning activities.	Semantic Scholar
By exploiting the semantic and spatial context factors in a unified way, SCOMM was able to reveal users' preferences behind their mention behaviors and provide a knowledge model for accurate mentionee recommendations.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we designed an Item-Attribute Pruning (IAP) algorithm to overcome the curse of dimensionality and facilitate online top-k query performance.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments were conducted on two real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of our methods.	Semantic Scholar

We study the convergence of the online composite mirror descent algorithm, which involves a mirror map to reflect the geometry of the data and a convex objective function consisting of a loss and a regularizer possibly inducing sparsity.	Semantic Scholar
Our error analysis provides convergence rates in terms of properties of the strongly convex differentiable mirror map and the objective function.	Semantic Scholar
For a class of objective functions with Hölder continuous gradients, the convergence rates of the excess (regularized) risk under polynomially decaying step sizes have the order after iterates.	Semantic Scholar
Our results improve the existing error analysis for the online composite mirror descent algorithm by avoiding averaging and removing boundedness assumptions, and they sharpen the existing convergence rates of the last iterate for online gradient descent without any boundedness assumptions.	Semantic Scholar
Our methodology mainly depends on a novel error decomposition in terms of an excess Bregman distance, refined analysis of self-bounding properties of the objective function, and the resulting one-step progress bounds.	Semantic Scholar
The communication-through-coherence (CTC) hypothesis states that a sending group of neurons will have a particularly strong effect on a receiving group if both groups oscillate in a phase-locked (“coherent”) manner (Fries, 2005, 2015).	Semantic Scholar
Here, we consider a situation with two visual stimuli, one in the focus of attention and the other distracting, resulting in two sites of excitation at an early cortical area that project to a common site in a next area.	Semantic Scholar
Taking a modeler’s perspective, we confirm the workings of a mechanism that was proposed by Bosman et al.	Semantic Scholar
(2012) in the context of providing experimental evidence for the CTC hypothesis: a slightly higher gamma frequency of the attended sending site compared to the distracting site may cause selective interareal synchronization with the receiving site if combined with a slow-rhythm gamma phase reset.	Semantic Scholar
We also demonstrate the relevance of a slightly lower intrinsic frequency of the receiving site for this scenario.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we discuss conditions for a transition from bottom-up to top-down driven phase locking.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents the design of a driver steering assistance system, which provides a corrective torque in order to guide the driver.	Semantic Scholar
While designing such a system, it is important to consider the interactions since the driver modifies the transfer function from the control input to the output of interest during a shared steering task.	Semantic Scholar
The novelty of our approach lies in the formulation of the predictive controller, which employs a model of the driver-in-the-loop steering dynamics, where an online parameter identification scheme is proposed to track the time-varying parameters of the process.	Semantic Scholar
An optimal guidance torque is calculated with respect to the level of interaction using the updated model.	Semantic Scholar
We validate the proposed approach by performing an experimental study with five participants in a guided lane, keeping task under different interaction behaviors of participants.	Semantic Scholar
The results show the system capability to adapt the control input based on the driver's acceptance on the torque intervention.	Semantic Scholar

This letter proposes a feedforward (FF) controller for the twisted and coiled polymer actuator (TCPA), the so-called fishing line/sewing thread artificial muscle, based on its macroscopic nonlinear model.	Semantic Scholar
TCPA is an artificial muscle, and it contracts up to 50% in response to heating.	Semantic Scholar
Although several methods considering Joule heating as the input have been proposed to control the TCPA displacement, the FF controller based on the linear model shows the nonnegligible offset error.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, the FF controller should be designed based on a nonlinear model, e.g., the model constructed by the authors.	Semantic Scholar
However, computing the inverse of the nonlinear model for the FF controller is difficult.	Semantic Scholar
Even if the inverse can be computed under static conditions, the problem of how to compensate the dynamics still remains.	Semantic Scholar
For this problem, we compensate the dynamics based on the idea of the Hammerstein model, namely we divide the inverse dynamics into the nonlinear transformation part and linear dynamics part.	Semantic Scholar
The former part consists of a converter from the displacement to temperature and a ratio adjuster for the squared voltage.	Semantic Scholar
Meanwhile, the latter is represented by the linear model of TCPA temperature.	Semantic Scholar
Through experiments, it is verified that the proposed FF controller can reduce the offset error of the displacement compared with the linear controller.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present the system infrastructure for a swarm of quadrotors, which perform all estimation on board using monocular visual inertial odometry.	Semantic Scholar
This is a novel system since it does not require an external motion capture system or GPS and is able to execute formation tasks without inter-robot collisions.	Semantic Scholar
The swarm can be deployed in nearly any indoor or outdoor scenario and is scalable to higher numbers of robots.	Semantic Scholar
We discuss the system architecture, estimation, planning, and control for the multirobot system.	Semantic Scholar
The robustness and scalability of the approach is validated in both indoor and outdoor environments with up to 12 quadrotors.	Semantic Scholar
We address the state estimation, control, and planning for aggressive flight with a 150 cm diameter, 250 g quadrotor equipped only with a single camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU).	Semantic Scholar
The use of smartphone grade hardware and the small scale provides an inexpensive and practical solution for autonomous flight in indoor environments.	Semantic Scholar
The key contributions of this paper are: 1) robust state estimation and control using only a monocular camera and an IMU at speeds of 4.5 m/s, accelerations of over 1.5 g, roll and pitch angles of up to 90°, and angular rate of up to 800°/s without requiring any structure in the environment; 2) planning of dynamically feasible three-dimensional trajectories for slalom paths and flights through narrow windows; and 3) extensive experimental results showing aggressive flights through and around obstacles with large rotation angular excursions and accelerations.

Implementation takes advantage of parallel processing and UAV metadata to generate a georeferenced mosaic over a geographic information system.	Semantic Scholar
A comparison with other mosaicking pipelines on three datasets demonstrates that MGRAPH could be an alternative to address the generation of mosaics from a swarm of UAVs.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, a novel approach to the cooperative path following (CPF) control problem is proposed that aims to reduce the frequency of communication between the robotic vehicles while achieving cooperation.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, a decentralized, event-based cooperative controller is designed to achieve coordination between the robotic vehicles, tasked to follow a priori specified reference geometric path while maintaining a desired formation.	Semantic Scholar
The event-based cooperative controller transmits the necessary information at discrete event times, that are computed based on an event triggering condition designed such that the convergence and stability properties of the consensus controller is preserved.	Semantic Scholar
The Input-to-State Stability framework is utilized to prove the stability and convergence of the CPF control with event-based control and communication scheme.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method is experimentally validated using Autonomous Surface Vehicles communicating over Wi-Fi.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown that the event-based approach results in significant reduction of information exchange between the vehicles when compared to the conventional periodic transmission.	Semantic Scholar
Event cameras are bioinspired vision sensors that output pixel-level brightness changes instead of standard intensity frames.	Semantic Scholar
They offer significant advantages over standard cameras, namely a very high dynamic range, no motion blur, and a latency in the order of microseconds.	Semantic Scholar
However, due to the fundamentally different structure of the sensor's output, new algorithms that exploit the high temporal resolution and the asynchronous nature of the sensor are required.	Semantic Scholar
Recent work has shown that a continuous-time representation of the event camera pose can deal with the high temporal resolution and asynchronous nature of this sensor in a principled way.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we leverage such a continuous-time representation to perform visual-inertial odometry with an event camera.	Semantic Scholar
This representation allows direct integration of the asynchronous events with microsecond accuracy and the inertial measurements at high frequency.	Semantic Scholar
The event camera trajectory is approximated by a smooth curve in the space of rigid-body motions using cubic splines.	Semantic Scholar
This formulation significantly reduces the number of variables in trajectory estimation problems.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our method on real data from several scenes and compare the results against ground truth from a motion-capture system.	Semantic Scholar
We show that our method provides improved accuracy over the result of a state-of-the-art visual odometry method for event cameras.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that both the map orientation and scale can be recovered accurately by fusing events and inertial data.	Semantic Scholar
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on visual-inertial fusion with event cameras using a continuous-time framework.	Semantic Scholar
Deep learning involves a difficult nonconvex optimization problem with a large number of weights between any two adjacent layers of a deep structure.	Semantic Scholar
To handle large data sets or complicated networks, distributed training is needed, but the calculation of function, gradient, and Hessian is expensive.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the communication and the synchronization cost may become a bottleneck.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we focus on situations where the model is distributedly stored and propose a novel distributed Newton method for training deep neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
By variable and feature-wise data partitions and some careful designs, we are able to explicitly use the Jacobian matrix for matrix-vector products in the Newton method.	Semantic Scholar
Some techniques are incorporated to reduce the running time as well as memory consumption.	Semantic Scholar
First, to reduce the communication cost, we propose a diagonalization method such that an approximate Newton direction can be obtained without communication between machines.	Semantic Scholar
Second, we consider subsampled Gauss-Newton matrices for reducing the running time as well as the communication cost.	Semantic Scholar
Third, to reduce the synchronization cost, we terminate the process of finding an approximate Newton direction even though some nodes have not finished their tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Details of some implementation issues in distributed environments are thoroughly investigated.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for the distributed training of deep neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
Compared with stochastic gradient methods, it is more robust and may give better test accuracy.	Semantic Scholar

Robotic technologies are being increasingly applied to agriculture, in particular to harvesting.	Semantic Scholar
Some types of produce such as iceberg lettuce require additional processing after harvesting in order to satisfy the needs of the end-user or customer.	Semantic Scholar
Lettuce must have its outer leaves removed, a task that is currently performed manually.	Semantic Scholar
The leaf removal task represents a challenging vision and manipulation problem: the lettuce is in a random pose on a flat surface, from which the outermost leaves must be removed quickly and without causing damage.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a novel vision pipeline and suction removal system that enables robotic lettuce leaf removal.	Semantic Scholar
A suction nozzle and control procedure are used for the removal itself, relying on the orientation estimation and stem detection provided by the vision pipeline.	Semantic Scholar
To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first robotic lettuce leaf peeling system.	Semantic Scholar
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are commonly used in place of expensive models to reduce the computational burden required for uncertainty quantification, reliability and sensitivity analyses.	Semantic Scholar
ANN with selected architecture is trained with the back-propagation algorithm from few data representatives of the input/output relationship of the underlying model of interest.	Semantic Scholar
However, different performing ANNs might be obtained with the same training data as a result of the random initialization of the weight parameters in each of the network, leading to an uncertainty in selecting the best performing ANN.	Semantic Scholar
On the other hand, using cross-validation to select the best performing ANN based on the ANN with the highest R2 value can lead to biassing in the prediction.	Semantic Scholar
This is as a result of the fact that the use of R2 cannot determine if the prediction made by ANN is biased.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, R2 does not indicate if a model is adequate, as it is possible to have a low R2 for a good model and a high R2 for a bad model.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, in this paper, we propose an approach to improve the robustness of a prediction made by ANN.	Semantic Scholar
The approach is based on a systematic combination of identical trained ANNs, by coupling the Bayesian framework and model averaging.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, the uncertainties of the robust prediction derived from the approach are quantified in terms of confidence intervals.	Semantic Scholar
To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach, two synthetic numerical examples are presented.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the proposed approach is used to perform a reliability and sensitivity analyses on a process simulation model of a UK nuclear effluent treatment plant developed by National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) and treated in this study as a black-box employing a set of training data as a test case.

This model has been extensively validated against plant and experimental data and used to support the UK effluent discharge strategy.	Semantic Scholar

Viral marketing is such a typical application in which new products or commercial activities are advertised by some seed users in OSNs to other users in a cascading manner.	Semantic Scholar
The selection of initial seed users yields a tradeoff between the expense and reward of viral marketing.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we define a general profit metric that naturally combines the benefit of influence spread with the cost of seed selection in viral marketing.	Semantic Scholar
We carry out a comprehensive study on finding a set of seed nodes to maximize the profit of viral marketing.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the profit metric is significantly different from the influence metric in that it is no longer monotone.	Semantic Scholar
This characteristic differentiates the profit maximization problem from the traditional influence maximization problem.	Semantic Scholar
We develop new seed selection algorithms for profit maximization with strong approximation guarantees.	Semantic Scholar
We also derive several upper bounds to benchmark the practical performance of an algorithm on any specific problem instance.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental evaluations with real OSN datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms and techniques.	Semantic Scholar
This letter proposes an algorithm to estimate the relative pose between two image view-points assuming that a camera is moving under a remote center of motion constraint.	Semantic Scholar
This is useful in minimally invasive robotic surgery, where the motion of a laparoscopic camera is constrained by the keyhole insertion point.	Semantic Scholar
Our method uses point correspondences between the two images and does not require any knowledge about the position of the remote center of motion.	Semantic Scholar
The pipeline consists of a 4-point minimal closed-form solver, used within a robust RANSAC framework to filter outlier correspondences, followed by a Levenberg–Marquardt refinement step.	Semantic Scholar
Our method compares favorably against the classic relative pose solution for unconstrained motion (5-point algorithm) both with synthetic data and a real footage of endoscopic robotic surgery.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose and demonstrate a method for integration of rotations using nonunit quaternions.	Semantic Scholar
Unit quaternions are commonly used to represent rotation, in which case the rotation operation involves the conjugate of the unit quaternion.	Semantic Scholar
However, a redundant mapping can be defined from all nonzero quaternions to the set of rotation matrices, ${\mathrm{SO}(3)}$, based on the more general rotation operation involving the quaternion inverse.	Semantic Scholar
From this we show that the well-known formula that maps angular velocity to the derivative of a unit quaternion actually represents the minimum-norm solution within a set of solutions for the derivative of a nonunit quaternion.	Semantic Scholar
This fact enables efficient, singularity free, numerical integration of rotations over long intervals.	Semantic Scholar
The approach inherently preserves the structure of  ${\mathrm{SO}(3)}$ during the integration with any standard routine or ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver package without employing specially designed geometric integration schemes, exponential updates, or the many quaternion length enforcement techniques found in the literature.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the accuracy of this approach compared to other common methods applied to integrate a known angular velocity function and a classic Lagrange top.	Semantic Scholar
A novel sparsity-based stochastic pooling which integrates the advantages of max-pooling, average-pooling and stochastic pooling is introduced.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed pooling is designed to balance the advantages and disadvantages of max-pooling and average-pooling by using the degree of sparsity of activations and a control function to obtain an optimized representative feature value ranging from average value to maximum value of a pooling region.	Semantic Scholar
The optimized representative feature value is employed for probability weights assignment of activations in normal distribution.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed pooling also adopts weighted random sampling with a reservoir for the sampling process to preserve the advantages of stochastic pooling.	Semantic Scholar
This proposed pooling is evaluated on several standard datasets in deep learning framework to compare with various classic pooling methods.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that it has good performance on improving recognition accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
The influence of changes to the feature parameter on recognition accuracy is also investigated.	Semantic Scholar
Hand sensorimotor impairments are among the most common consequences of injuries affecting the central and peripheral nervous systems, leading to a drastic reduction in the quality of life for affected individuals.	Semantic Scholar
Combining wearable robotic exoskeletons and human–machine interfaces is a promising avenue for the restoration and substitution of lost and impaired functions for these users.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we present a novel hand exoskeleton, mano, designed to assist and restore hand functions of people with motor disabilities during activities of daily living (ADL) and in neurorehabilitative scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
Compared to state-of-the-art devices, our system is fully wearable, portable, and minimally obtrusive on the hand.	Semantic Scholar
The exoskeleton can actively control flexion and extension of all fingers, while allowing natural somatosensorial interactions with the environment surrounding the users.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluated the device from four different perspectives.	Semantic Scholar
A mechanical characterization, showing that the exoskeleton can cover more than 70% of healthy hand workspace and it can achieve forces at the fingertips sufficient for ADL.	Semantic Scholar
A functional characterization, where we showed how two users who suffered from spinal cord injuries were able to perform several ADL for the first time since their accidents.	Semantic Scholar
Third, we evaluated the system from a neuroimaging perspective, showing that the device can elicit EEG brain patterns typical of natural hand motions.	Semantic Scholar
We finally exemplified the control of the hand exoskeleton within an exemplar framework, a brain–machine interface scenario, showing that motor intention can be decoded for a continuous control of the device.	Semantic Scholar
Overall, our results showed that the device represents an ecological solution for use both in ADL and in scenarios aimed at promoting sensorimotor recovery.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we present a case study in which a 14-year-old, right-handed stroke patient with severe weakness, spasticity, and motor dysfunction of the left upper extremity participated in a three-month distal robotic training program.	Semantic Scholar
The robotic device was compliant to the patients movements and was able to modulate the level of assistance continuously throughout the trial (i.e., online adaptive modulation).	Semantic Scholar
Standard clinical and robotic evaluations of upper extremity motor performance were conducted before and after robotic training.	Semantic Scholar
There were improvements in upper extremity spasticity and motor functions.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, robotic training lead to positive changes in wrist active range of motion and kinematics: movements were smoother and there was a noticeable decrease in the level of robotic intervention required to complete each trial.	Semantic Scholar
In sum, results of the present case study demonstrate that distal upper extremity robotic rehabilitation that features the proposed adaptive control algorithm promoted positive changes in upper limb motor coordination and function after pediatric stroke.	Semantic Scholar
There is a growing interest in analyzing the geometrical behavior of electroencephalogram (EEG) covariance matrix in the context of brain computer interface (BCI).	Semantic Scholar
The bottleneck of the current Riemannian framework is the bias of the mean vector of EEG signals to the noisy trials, which deteriorates the covariance matrix in the manifold space.	Semantic Scholar
This study presents a spatial weighting scheme to reduce the effect of noisy trials on the mean vector.	Semantic Scholar
To assess the proposed method, dataset IIa from BCI competition IV, containing the EEG trials of 9 subjects performing four mental tasks, was utilized.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of the proposed method is compared to the classical Riemannian method along with Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) on the dataset.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that when considering just two imagery classes, the proposed method performs on par with CSP method, whereas in the multi class scenario, the proposed algorithm outperforms the CSP approach on seven out of nine subjects.	Semantic Scholar
Incidentally, the proposed method obtains better accuracy for the majority of subjects compared to the classical Riemannian method.	Semantic Scholar
Mobile robotic platforms are an indispensable tool for various scientific and industrial applications.	Semantic Scholar
Robots are used to undertake missions whose execution is constrained by various factors, such as the allocated time or their remaining energy.	Semantic Scholar
Existing solutions for resource constrained multirobot sensing mission planning provide optimal plans at a prohibitive computational complexity for online application.	Semantic Scholar
A heuristic approach exists for an online, resource-constrained sensing mission planning for a single vehicle.	Semantic Scholar
This letter proposes a genetic algorithm  (GA) based heuristic for the correlated team orienteering problem that is used for planning sensing and monitoring missions for robotic teams that operate under resource constraints.	Semantic Scholar
The heuristic is compared against optimal mixed integer quadratic programming solutions.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that the quality of the heuristic solution is at the worst case equal to the 5% optimal solution.	Semantic Scholar
The heuristic solution proves to be at least 300 times more time efficient in the worst tested case.	Semantic Scholar
The GA heuristic execution required in the worst case less than a second making it suitable for online execution.	Semantic Scholar
Social media plays a major role in helping people affected by natural calamities.	Semantic Scholar
These people use social media to request information and help in situations where time is a critical commodity.	Semantic Scholar
However, generic social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook are not conducive for obtaining answers promptly.	Semantic Scholar
Algorithms to ensure prompt responders for questions in social media have to understand and model the factors affecting their response time.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we draw from sociological studies on information seeking and organizational behavior to identify users who can provide timely and relevant responses to questions posted on social media.	Semantic Scholar
We first draw from these theories to model the future availability and past response behavior of the candidate responders and integrate these criteria with user relevance.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a learning algorithm from these criteria to derive optimal rankings of responders for a given question.	Semantic Scholar
We present questions posted on Twitter as a form of information seeking activity in social media and use them to evaluate our framework.	Semantic Scholar
Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework is useful in identifying timely and relevant responders for questions in social media.	Semantic Scholar
Advances in robotics have allowed mobile robotic platforms to be deployed in an increased number of field operations.	Semantic Scholar
The dynamic nature of the operating environment can constrain the robotic mission execution in terms of required time or energy.	Semantic Scholar
Current solutions for providing optimal and optimized plans for the resource-constrained sensing mission planning only consider holonomic vehicles.	Semantic Scholar
This letter proposes the Dubins Correlated Orienteering Problem (DCOP) as a solution for resource constrained sensing missions undertaken by a nonholonomic Dubins vehicle.	Semantic Scholar
It provides a Genetic Algorithm heuristic for finding optimised solutions in a timely manner.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed heuristic is compared against the GA heuristic solution for the  Correlated Orienteering Problem (COP) and the heuristic for the Dubins Orienteering Problem (DOP).	Semantic Scholar
It performs equally good with the COP heuristic in terms of utility with an increase in the execution time.	Semantic Scholar
When tested against the DOP problem it performs comparably good.	Semantic Scholar
In the worst case, it produces solutions with $\text{13}\%$ less utility but requiring orders of magnitude less time than the state of the art.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the proposed method is tested in a scenario where the budget consumption is changing during mission execution.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown that a new plan can be devised online, leading to increased mission performance.	Semantic Scholar
Given the results, it sets the baseline for comparing any future approaches that will address the DCOP problem.	Semantic Scholar
One of the primary challenges for autonomous robotics in uncertain and dynamic environments is planning and executing a collision-free path.	Semantic Scholar
Hybrid dynamic obstacles present an even greater challenge as the obstacles can change dynamics without warning and potentially invalidate paths.	Semantic Scholar
Artificial potential field (APF)-based techniques have shown great promise in successful path planning in highly dynamic environments due to their low cost at runtime.	Semantic Scholar
We utilize the APF framework for runtime planning but leverage a formal validation method, Stochastic Reachable (SR) sets, to generate accurate potential fields for moving obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
A small number of SR sets are computed a priori, then used to generate a potential field that represents the obstacle's stochastic motion for online path planning.	Semantic Scholar
Our method is novel and scales well with the number of obstacles, maintaining a relatively high probability of reaching the goal without collision, as compared to other traditional Gaussian APF methods.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we demonstrate our method with up to 900 hybrid dynamic obstacles and show that it outperforms the traditional Gaussian APF method by up to 60% in the holonomic case and up to 20% in the unicycle case.	Semantic Scholar
There are numerous contexts where individuals typically consume a few items from a large selection of possible items.	Semantic Scholar
Examples include purchasing products, listening to music, visiting locations in physical or virtual environments, and so on.	Semantic Scholar
There has been significant prior work in such contexts on developing predictive modeling techniques for recommending new items to individuals, often using techniques such as matrix factorization.	Semantic Scholar
There are many situations, however, where making predictions for both previously-consumed and new items for an individual is important, rather than just recommending new items.	Semantic Scholar
We investigate this problem and find that widely-used matrix factorization methods are limited in their ability to capture important details in historical behavior, resulting in relatively low predictive accuracy for these types of problems.	Semantic Scholar
As an alternative we propose an interpretable and scalable mixture model framework that balances individual preferences in terms of exploration and exploitation.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our model in terms of accuracy in user consumption predictions using several real-world datasets, including location data, social media data, and music listening data.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that the mixture model approach is systematically more accurate and more efficient for these problems compared to a variety of state-of-the-art matrix factorization methods.	Semantic Scholar
The locations of the fiducial facial landmark points around facial components and facial contour capture the rigid and non-rigid facial deformations due to head movements and facial expressions.	Semantic Scholar
They are hence important for various facial analysis tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Many facial landmark detection algorithms have been developed to automatically detect those key points over the years, and in this paper, we perform an extensive review of them.	Semantic Scholar
We classify the facial landmark detection algorithms into three major categories: holistic methods, Constrained Local Model (CLM) methods, and the regression-based methods.	Semantic Scholar
They differ in the ways to utilize the facial appearance and shape information.	Semantic Scholar
The holistic methods explicitly build models to represent the global facial appearance and shape information.	Semantic Scholar
The CLMs explicitly leverage the global shape model but build the local appearance models.	Semantic Scholar
The regression based methods implicitly capture facial shape and appearance information.	Semantic Scholar
For algorithms within each category, we discuss their underlying theories as well as their differences.	Semantic Scholar
We also compare their performances on both controlled and in the wild benchmark datasets, under varying facial expressions, head poses, and occlusion.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the evaluations, we point out their respective strengths and weaknesses.	Semantic Scholar
There is also a separate section to review the latest deep learning based algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
The survey also includes a listing of the benchmark databases and existing software.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we identify future research directions, including combining methods in different categories to leverage their respective strengths to solve landmark detection “in-the-wild”.	Semantic Scholar
Linking human whole-body motion and natural language is of great interest for the generation of semantic representations of observed human behaviors as well as for the generation of robot behaviors based on natural language input.	Semantic Scholar
While there has been a large body of research in this area, most approaches that exist today require a symbolic representation of motions (e.g.	Semantic Scholar
in the form of motion primitives), which have to be defined a-priori or require complex segmentation algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast, recent advances in the field of neural networks and especially deep learning have demonstrated that sub-symbolic representations that can be learned end-to-end usually outperform more traditional approaches, for applications such as machine translation.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we propose a generative model that learns a bidirectional mapping between human whole-body motion and natural language using deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and sequence-to-sequence learning.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach does not require any segmentation or manual feature engineering and learns a distributed representation, which is shared for all motions and descriptions.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our approach on 2 846 human whole-body motions and 6 187 natural language descriptions thereof from the KIT Motion-Language Dataset.	Semantic Scholar
Our results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model: We show that our model generates a wide variety of realistic motions only from descriptions thereof in form of a single sentence.	Semantic Scholar
Conversely, our model is also capable of generating correct and detailed natural language descriptions from human motions.	Semantic Scholar
We mechanise a proof of Green’s theorem in Isabelle/HOL.	Semantic Scholar
We use a novel proof that avoids the ubiquitous line integral cancellation argument.	Semantic Scholar
This eliminates the need to formalise orientations and region boundaries explicitly with respect to the outwards-pointing normal vector.	Semantic Scholar
Instead we appeal to a homological argument about equivalences between paths.	Semantic Scholar
Contributions include mechanised theories of line integrals and partial derivatives, as well as the first mechanisation of Green’s theorem.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we present a communication paradigm using a context-aware mixed-reality approach for instructing human workers when collaborating with robots.	Semantic Scholar
The main objective is to utilize the physical work environment as a canvas to communicate task-related instructions and robot intentions in the form of visual cues.	Semantic Scholar
A vision-based object-tracking algorithm is used to precisely determine the pose and state of physical objects in and around the workspace.	Semantic Scholar
A projection-mapping technique is employed to overlay visual cues on the tracked objects and the workspace.	Semantic Scholar
Simultaneous tracking and projection onto objects enable the system to provide just-in-time instructions for carrying out a procedural task.	Semantic Scholar
Recent advances in smart materials and microfabrication techniques lead to the development of microrobots for on-demand and targeted therapy.	Semantic Scholar
Self-folded hydrogel tubes are particularly promising vehicles as they provide relatively large surface area-to-volume ratio and cargo space for therapeutic agents.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we decorate these microstructures with an artificially approximated bacterial flagellum to enable efficient swimming in fluidic environments.	Semantic Scholar
Flexibility enhances overall motility of the soft microrobot through synergistic propulsion generated by the tubular body and the flagellum, a feature that has not been observed in conventional microrobots manufactured from rigid materials.	Semantic Scholar
While the flagellum is applying forward thrust, a precession is induced on the body due to wobbling of the tail that can provide extra speed depending on the tail design.	Semantic Scholar
A simple model based on resistive force theory explains the direction-dependent changes in swimming motility and the role of tail geometry.	Semantic Scholar
CP solvers predominantly use arc consistency (AC) as the default propagation method for binary constraints.	Semantic Scholar
Many stronger consistencies, such as triangle consistencies (e.g.	Semantic Scholar
RPC and maxRPC) exist, but their use is limited despite results showing that they outperform AC on many problems.	Semantic Scholar
This is due to the intricacies involved in incorporating them into solvers.	Semantic Scholar
On the other hand, singleton consistencies such as SAC can be easily crafted into solvers but they are too expensive in practice.	Semantic Scholar
Seeking a balance between the efficiency of triangle consistencies and the ease of implementation of singleton ones, we study the family of neighborhood singleton consistencies (NSCs) which extends the recently proposed neighborhood SAC (NSAC).	Semantic Scholar
We propose several new members of this family and study them both theoretically and experimentally.	Semantic Scholar
Our theroretical results show that the pruning power of the proposed NSCs ranges between that of RPC and (3,1)-consistency.	Semantic Scholar
Using a very simple algorithm for the implementation of NSCs, we demonstrate that certain members of the NSC family are quite competitive as general-purpose propagation methods for binary constraints, significantly outperforming the existing propagation techniques on some problem classes.	Semantic Scholar
This work addresses the problem of semantic foggy scene understanding (SFSU).	Semantic Scholar
Although extensive research has been performed on image dehazing and on semantic scene understanding with clear-weather images, little attention has been paid to SFSU.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating foggy images, we choose to generate synthetic fog on real images that depict clear-weather outdoor scenes, and then leverage these partially synthetic data for SFSU by employing state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNN).	Semantic Scholar
In particular, a complete pipeline to add synthetic fog to real, clear-weather images using incomplete depth information is developed.	Semantic Scholar
We apply our fog synthesis on the Cityscapes dataset and generate Foggy Cityscapes with 20,550 images.	Semantic Scholar
SFSU is tackled in two ways: (1) with typical supervised learning, and (2) with a novel type of semi-supervised learning, which combines (1) with an unsupervised supervision transfer from clear-weather images to their synthetic foggy counterparts.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we carefully study the usefulness of image dehazing for SFSU.	Semantic Scholar
For evaluation, we present Foggy Driving, a dataset with 101 real-world images depicting foggy driving scenes, which come with ground truth annotations for semantic segmentation and object detection.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments show that (1) supervised learning with our synthetic data significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art CNN for SFSU on Foggy Driving; (2) our semi-supervised learning strategy further improves performance; and (3) image dehazing marginally advances SFSU with our learning strategy.	Semantic Scholar
The datasets, models and code are made publicly available.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, the design of a novel bilateral telerobotic architecture for rehabilitation purposes is proposed and the related feasibility, stability, and control challenges are studied.	Semantic Scholar
The objective is to incorporate the supervision of a local/remote human physiotherapist into haptics-enabled rehabilitation systems and allow the therapist to provide nonpassive nonlinear assistive/resistive forces in response to the patient's movements.	Semantic Scholar
This can address a challenge of conventional software-based rehabilitation systems, i.e., limited capability in adjusting the therapy.	Semantic Scholar
To guarantee human–robot interaction safety, a new design framework and a stabilizing controller are developed based on the small-gain approach.	Semantic Scholar
System stability and transparency are analyzed in the presence of the nonpassive, nonlinear, and nonautonomous behavior of the terminals (the therapist and the patient) and time-varying delays for the case of remote and cloud-based therapy.	Semantic Scholar
Several practical considerations have been taken into account to match the clinical needs and minimize the implementation cost.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation studies, practical implementation, and experimental evaluations are presented.	Semantic Scholar
We present a shared-control framework predicated on a measure of trust in the operator, that is calculated automatically based on the quality of the interactions between a human and autonomous system.	Semantic Scholar
This measure of trust is built upon a control-theoretic foundation that rewards stable operation of the system to give more trusted users additional control authority.	Semantic Scholar
The level of control authority is used to modify the human input, and as a result, we observe a minimization of the required effort of the controller.	Semantic Scholar
We validate this work within a planar crane environment with a receding horizon controller to assist with the regulation of the system dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
The human defines the reference trajectory for the controller.	Semantic Scholar
In an experimental study users navigate a suspended payload through a set of maze configurations.	Semantic Scholar
We find that adaptation of the trust metric over time provides the benefit of substantially ( $p <; 0.01$) improving the automated system's ability to modulate the user's input, resulting in stable reference trajectories that require less effort to track.	Semantic Scholar
In effect, the human and automation spend less time fighting each other during task execution, suggesting that the automated system and user each have a better understanding of the other's ability.	Semantic Scholar
Items in real-world recommender systems exhibit certain hierarchical structures.	Semantic Scholar
Similarly, user preferences also present hierarchical structures.	Semantic Scholar
Recent studies show that incorporating the hierarchy of items or user preferences can improve the performance of recommender systems.	Semantic Scholar
However, hierarchical structures are often not explicitly available, especially those of user preferences.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, there's a gap between the importance of hierarchies and their availability.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we investigate the problem of exploring the implicit hierarchical structures for recommender systems when they are not explicitly available.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel recommendation framework to bridge the gap, which enables us to explore the implicit hierarchies of users and items simultaneously.	Semantic Scholar
We then extend the framework to integrate explicit hierarchies when they are available, which gives a unified framework for both explicit and implicit hierarchical structures.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework by incorporating implicit and explicit structures.	Semantic Scholar
Obstacle avoidance is a necessary behavior to guarantee the safety of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).	Semantic Scholar
However, it is a challenge for the UAV to detect and avoid highspeed flying obstacles such as other UAVs or birds.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a generic framework that integrates an autonomous obstacle detection module and a reinforcement learning (RL) module to develop reactive obstacle avoidance behavior for a UAV.	Semantic Scholar
In the obstacle detection module, we design a saliency detection algorithm using deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) to extract monocular visual cues.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm imitates human’s visual detection system, and it can accurately estimate the location of obstacles in the field of view (FOV).	Semantic Scholar
The RL module uses an actor-critic structure that chooses the RBF neural network to approximate the value function and control policy in continuous state and action spaces.	Semantic Scholar
We have tested the effectiveness of the proposed learning framework in a semi-physical experiment.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that the proposed saliency detection algorithm performs better than state-of-the-art, and the RL algorithm can learn the avoidance behavior from the manual experiences.	Semantic Scholar
A new obstacle detection algorithm for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) is presented.	Semantic Scholar
A state-of-the-art graphical model for semantic segmentation is extended to incorporate boat pitch and roll measurements from the on-board inertial measurement unit (IMU), and a stereo verification algorithm that consolidates tentative detections obtained from the segmentation is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
The IMU readings are used to estimate the location of horizon line in the image, which automatically adjusts the priors in the probabilistic semantic segmentation model.	Semantic Scholar
We derive the equations for projecting the horizon into images, propose an efficient optimization algorithm for the extended graphical model, and offer a practical IMU-camera-USV calibration procedure.	Semantic Scholar
Using an USV equipped with multiple synchronized sensors, we captured a new challenging multi-modal dataset, and annotated its images with water edge and obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state of the art, with nearly 30 % improvement in water-edge detection accuracy, an over 21 % reduction of false positive rate, an almost 60 % reduction of false negative rate, and an over 65 % increase of true positive rate, while its Matlab implementation runs in real-time.	Semantic Scholar
The genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a popular approach to identify disease-associated genetic factors for Alzhemer's Disease (AD).	Semantic Scholar
However, it remains challenging because of the small number of samples, very high feature dimensionality and complex structures.	Semantic Scholar
To accurately identify genetic risk factors for AD, we propose a novel method based on an in-depth exploration of the hierarchical structure among the features and the commonality across related tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we first extract and encode the tree hierarchy among features; then, we integrate the tree structures with multi-task feature learning (MTFL) to learn the shared features—that are predictive of AD—among related tasks simultaneously.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, we can unify the strength of both the prior structure information and MTFL to boost the prediction performance.	Semantic Scholar
However, due to the highly complex regularizer that encodes the tree structure and the extremely high feature dimensionality, the learning process can be computationally prohibitive.	Semantic Scholar
To address this, we further develop a novel safe screening rule to quickly identify and remove the irrelevant features before training.	Semantic Scholar
Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in detecting genetic risk factors of AD and the speedup gained by the proposed screening can be several orders of magnitude.	Semantic Scholar

Flexible medical robots can improve surgical procedures by decreasing invasiveness and increasing accessibility within the body.	Semantic Scholar
Using preoperative images, these robots can be designed to optimize a procedure for a particular patient.	Semantic Scholar
To minimize invasiveness and maximize biocompatibility, the actuation units of flexible medical robots should be placed fully outside the patient's body.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a novel, compact, lightweight, modular actuation, and control system for driving a class of these flexible robots, known as concentric tube robots.	Semantic Scholar
A key feature of the design is the use of three-dimensional printed waffle gears to enable compact control of two degrees of freedom within each module.	Semantic Scholar
We measure the precision and accuracy of a single actuation module and demonstrate the ability of an integrated set of three actuation modules to control six degrees of freedom.	Semantic Scholar
The integrated system drives a three-tube concentric tube robot to reach a final tip position that is on average less than 2 mm from a given target.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we show a handheld manifestation of the device and present its potential applications.	Semantic Scholar
Texture is a fundamental characteristic of many types of images, and texture representation is one of the essential and challenging problems in computer vision and pattern recognition which has attracted extensive research attention over several decades.	Semantic Scholar
Since 2000, texture representations based on Bag of Words and on Convolutional Neural Networks have been extensively studied with impressive performance.	Semantic Scholar
Given this period of remarkable evolution, this paper aims to present a comprehensive survey of advances in texture representation over the last two decades.	Semantic Scholar
More than 250 major publications are cited in this survey covering different aspects of the research, including benchmark datasets and state of the art results.	Semantic Scholar
In retrospect of what has been achieved so far, the survey discusses open challenges and directions for future research.	Semantic Scholar
Tactile feedback is pivotal for grasping and manipulation in humans.	Semantic Scholar
Providing functionally effective sensory feedback to prostheses users is an open challenge.	Semantic Scholar
Past paradigms were mostly based on vibro- or electrotactile stimulations.	Semantic Scholar
However, the tactile sensitivity on the targeted body parts (usually the forearm) is greatly less than that of the hand/fingertips, restricting the amount of information that can be provided through this channel.	Semantic Scholar
Visual feedback is the most investigated technique in motor learning studies, where it showed positive effects in learning both simple and complex tasks; however, it was not exploited in prosthetics due to technological limitations.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we investigated if visual information provided in the form of augmented reality (AR) feedback can be integrated by able-bodied participants in their sensorimotor control of a pick-and-lift task while controlling a robotic hand.	Semantic Scholar
For this purpose, we provided visual continuous feedback related to grip force and hand closure to the participants.	Semantic Scholar
Each variable was mapped to the length of one of the two ellipse axes visualized on the screen of wearable single-eye display AR glasses.	Semantic Scholar
We observed changes in behavior when subtle (i.e., not announced to the participants) manipulation of the AR feedback was introduced, which indicated that the participants integrated the artificial feedback within the sensorimotor control of the task.	Semantic Scholar
These results demonstrate that it is possible to deliver effective information through AR feedback in a compact and wearable fashion.	Semantic Scholar
This feedback modality may be exploited for delivering sensory feedback to amputees in a clinical scenario.	Semantic Scholar
Over the last two decades, face alignment or localizing fiducial facial points on 2D images has received increasing attention owing to its comprehensive applications in automatic face analysis.	Semantic Scholar
However, such a task has proven extremely challenging in unconstrained environments due to many confounding factors, such as pose, occlusions, expression and illumination.	Semantic Scholar
While numerous techniques have been developed to address these challenges, this problem is still far away from being solved.	Semantic Scholar
In this survey, we present an up-to-date critical review of the existing literatures on face alignment, focusing on those methods addressing overall difficulties and challenges of this topic under uncontrolled conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we categorize existing face alignment techniques, present detailed descriptions of the prominent algorithms within each category, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we organize special discussions on the practical aspects of face alignment in-the-wild , towards the development of a robust face alignment system.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we show performance statistics of the state of the art, and conclude this paper with several promising directions for future research.	Semantic Scholar

Previous work has demonstrated the versatility of soft robotic grippers using simple control inputs.	Semantic Scholar
However, these grippers still face challenges in grasping large objects and in achieving high-strength grasps.	Semantic Scholar
This work investigates the combination of fluidic elastomer actuators and gecko-inspired adhesives to both enhance existing soft gripper properties and generate new capabilities.	Semantic Scholar
On rocky or dirty surfaces where adhesion is limited, the gripper retains the functionality of a pneumatically actuated elastomer gripper with no measured loss in performance.	Semantic Scholar
Design strategies for using the unique properties of the gecko-inspired adhesives are presented.	Semantic Scholar
By modeling fluidic elastomer actuators as a series of joints with associated joint torques, we designed an actuator that takes advantage of the unique properties of the gecko-inspired adhesive.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments showed higher strength grasps at lower pressures compared to nongecko actuators, in many cases enabling the gripper to actuate more quickly and use less energy.	Semantic Scholar
The gripper weighs 48.7 g, uses $7.25 of raw materials, and can support loads of over 50 N. A second gripper, using three fingers for a larger adhesive surface, demonstrated a grasping force of 111 N (25 lbf) when actuated at an internal pressure of 40 kPa.	Semantic Scholar

This paper identifies and characterizes factors that contribute to operator workload in unmanned vehicle systems.	Semantic Scholar
Our objective is to provide a basis for developing models of workload for use in design and operation of complex human–machine systems.	Semantic Scholar
In 1986, Hart developed a foundational conceptual model of workload, which formed the basis for arguably the most widely used workload measurement technique—the NASA Task Load Index.	Semantic Scholar
Since that time, however, there have been many advances in models and factor identification as well as workload control measures.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, there is a need to further inventory and describe factors that contribute to human workload in light of technological advances, including automation and autonomy.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, we propose a conceptual framework for the workload construct and present a taxonomy of factors that can contribute to operator workload.	Semantic Scholar
These factors, referred to as workload drivers, are associated with a variety of system elements including the environment, task, equipment, and operator.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we discuss how workload moderators, such as automation and interface design, can be manipulated in order to influence operator workload.	Semantic Scholar
We contend that workload drivers, workload moderators, and the interactions among drivers and moderators all need to be accounted for when building complex human–machine systems.	Semantic Scholar

Current state of the art scan registration algorithms which use only position information often fall victim to correspondence ambiguity and degeneracy in the optimization solutions.	Semantic Scholar
Other methods which use additional channels, such as color or intensity, often use only a small fraction of the available information and ignore the underlying structural information of the added channels.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method incorporates the additional channels directly into the scan registration formulation to provide information within the plane of the surface.	Semantic Scholar
This is achieved by calculating the uncertainty both along and perpendicular to the local surface at each point and calculating nearest neighbor correspondences in the higher dimensional space.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method reduces instances of degenerate transformation estimates and improves both registration accuracy and convergence rate.	Semantic Scholar
The method is tested on the Ford Vision and Lidar dataset using both color and intensity channels, as well as with Microsoft Kinect data from the Freiburg RGBD Office dataset and data obtained from the University of Waterloo campus.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a novel self-sensing method for soft actuators based on dielectric elastomer (DE) membranes.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed self-sensing scheme permits the reconstruction of both membrane force and displacement during actuation, based on voltage and current measurements only.	Semantic Scholar
The simultaneous self-sensing of displacement and force allows one to implement interaction control strategies without the need for additional electro-mechanical transducers.	Semantic Scholar
To achieve this goal, an online estimation algorithm based on recursive least squares is implemented to reconstruct the membrane capacitance from voltage and current measurements.	Semantic Scholar
Subsequently, mathematical models are developed to relate the capacitance to membrane displacement and force.	Semantic Scholar
Several modeling approaches are compared, ranging from physics-based to black box ones (i.e., Hammerstein–Wiener models and neural networks), in order to evaluate which strategy maximizes the estimation accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
After discussing the complete self-sensing algorithm, experimental validation is performed on a prototype consisting of a cone DE membrane.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a zoom-out-and-in network for generating object proposals.	Semantic Scholar
A key observation is that it is difficult to classify anchors of different sizes with the same set of features.	Semantic Scholar
Anchors of different sizes should be placed accordingly based on different depth within a network: smaller boxes on high-resolution layers with a smaller stride while larger boxes on low-resolution counterparts with a larger stride.	Semantic Scholar
Inspired by the conv/deconv structure, we fully leverage the low-level local details and high-level regional semantics from two feature map streams, which are complimentary to each other, to identify the objectness in an image.	Semantic Scholar
A map attention decision (MAD) unit is further proposed to aggressively search for neuron activations among two streams and attend the most contributive ones on the feature learning of the final loss.	Semantic Scholar
The unit serves as a decision-maker to adaptively activate maps along certain channels with the solely purpose of optimizing the overall training loss.	Semantic Scholar
One advantage of MAD is that the learned weights enforced on each feature channel is predicted on-the-fly based on the input context, which is more suitable than the fixed enforcement of a convolutional kernel.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm over other state-of-the-arts, in terms of average recall for region proposal and average precision for object detection.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a method for hand pose estimation based on a deep regressor trained on two different kinds of input.	Semantic Scholar
Raw depth data is fused with an intermediate representation in the form of a segmentation of the hand into parts.	Semantic Scholar
This intermediate representation contains important topological information and provides useful cues for reasoning about joint locations.	Semantic Scholar
The mapping from raw depth to segmentation maps is learned in a semiand weakly-supervised way from two different datasets: (i) a synthetic dataset created through a rendering pipeline including densely labeled ground truth (pixelwise segmentations); and (ii) a dataset with real images for which ground truth joint positions are available, but not dense segmentations.	Semantic Scholar
Loss for training on real images is generated from a patch-wise restoration process, which aligns tentative segmentation maps with a large dictionary of synthetic poses.	Semantic Scholar
The underlying premise is that the domain shift between synthetic and real data is smaller in the intermediate representation, where labels carry geometric and topological meaning, than in the raw input domain.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on the NYU dataset [1] show that the proposed training method decreases error on joints over direct regression of joints from depth data by 15.7%.	Semantic Scholar
A common practice to account for psychophysical biases in vision is to frame them as consequences of a dynamic process relying on optimal inference with respect to a generative model.	Semantic Scholar
The study presented here details the complete formulation of such a generative model intended to probe visual motion perception with a dynamic texture model.	Semantic Scholar
It is derived in a set of axiomatic steps constrained by biological plausibility.	Semantic Scholar
We extend previous contributions by detailing three equivalent formulations of this texture model.	Semantic Scholar
First, the composite dynamic textures are constructed by the random aggregation of warped patterns, which can be viewed as three-dimensional gaussian fields.	Semantic Scholar
Second, these textures are cast as solutions to a stochastic partial differential equation (sPDE).	Semantic Scholar
This essential step enables real-time, on-the-fly texture synthesis using time-discretized autoregressive processes.	Semantic Scholar
It also allows for the derivation of a local motion-energy model, which corresponds to the log likelihood of the probability density.	Semantic Scholar
The log likelihoods are essential for the construction of a Bayesian inference framework.	Semantic Scholar
We use the dynamic texture model to psychophysically probe speed perception in humans using zoom-like changes in the spatial frequency content of the stimulus.	Semantic Scholar
The human data replicate previous findings showing perceived speed to be positively biased by spatial frequency increments.	Semantic Scholar
A Bayesian observer who combines a gaussian likelihood centered at the true speed and a spatial frequency dependent width with a “slow-speed prior” successfully accounts for the perceptual bias.	Semantic Scholar
More precisely, the bias arises from a decrease in the observer's likelihood width estimated from the experiments as the spatial frequency increases.	Semantic Scholar
Such a trend is compatible with the trend of the dynamic texture likelihood width.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, the accuracy of visual tracking is enhanced by leveraging a novel measure for observation quality.	Semantic Scholar
We measure observation quality with mutual information, then look at the interval covered by that mutual information.	Semantic Scholar
As observation uncertainty the interval length is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
The best observation is considered the one that both maximizes the observation quality and minimizes the observation uncertainty.	Semantic Scholar
We show that searching for the best observation in these terms amounts to preprocessing the image by subtracting the background, detecting salient regions, and rendering the image illumination-invariant.	Semantic Scholar
These preprocessing steps are very fast and can precede any existing tracker.	Semantic Scholar
In experiments it is shown that the performance of several trackers can be substantially boosted when they run on our preprocessed images, rather than the raw input for which they were intended.	Semantic Scholar
In all cases the version with preprocessing significantly outperforms the original tracker’s performance.	Semantic Scholar
Recommender systems are collecting and analyzing user data to provide better user experience.	Semantic Scholar
However, several privacy concerns have been raised when a recommender knows user's set of items or their ratings.	Semantic Scholar
A number of solutions have been suggested to improve privacy of legacy recommender systems, but the existing solutions in the literature can protect either items or ratings only.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a recommender system that protects both user's items and ratings.	Semantic Scholar
For this, we develop novel matrix factorization algorithms under local differential privacy (LDP).	Semantic Scholar
In a recommender system with LDP, individual users randomize their data themselves to satisfy differential privacy and send the perturbed data to the recommender.	Semantic Scholar
Then, the recommender computes aggregates of the perturbed data.	Semantic Scholar
This framework ensures that both user's items and ratings remain private from the recommender.	Semantic Scholar
However, applying LDP to matrix factorization typically raises utility issues with i) high dimensionality due to a large number of items and ii) iterative estimation algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
To tackle these technical challenges, we adopt dimensionality reduction technique and a novel binary mechanism based on sampling.	Semantic Scholar
We additionally introduce a factor that stabilizes the perturbed gradients.	Semantic Scholar
With MovieLens and LibimSeTi datasets, we evaluate recommendation accuracy of our recommender system and demonstrate that our algorithm performs better than the existing differentially private gradient descent algorithm for matrix factorization under stronger privacy requirements.	Semantic Scholar
When moving an object endowed with continuous symmetry, an ambiguity arises in its underlying rigid body transformation, induced by the arbitrariness of the portion of motion that does not change the overall body shape.	Semantic Scholar
The functional redundancy caused by continuous symmetry is ubiquitously present in a broad range of robotic applications, including robot machining and haptic interface (revolute symmetry), remote center of motion devices for minimal invasive surgery (line symmetry), and motion modules for hyperredundant robots (plane symmetry).	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we argue that such functional redundancy can be systematically resolved by resorting to symmetric subspaces (SSs) of the special Euclidean group $\mathrm{SE}(3)$, which motivates us to systematically investigate the structural synthesis of SS motion generators.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we develop a general synthesis procedure that allows us to generate a wide spectrum of novel mechanisms for use in the applications mentioned.	Semantic Scholar

We present a proof of the fact that for $$n \ge 0$$ n ≥ 0 .	Semantic Scholar
This result has a standard proof via an integral, but our proof is purely number-theoretic, requiring little more than inductions based on lists.	Semantic Scholar
The almost-pictorial proof is based on manipulations of a variant of Leibniz’s harmonic triangle, itself a relative of Pascal’s better-known Triangle.	Semantic Scholar
Unmanned aerial vehicle use continues to increase, including operating beyond line of sight in unknown environments where the vehicle must autonomously generate a trajectory to safely navigate.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we develop a trajectory generation algorithm for vehicles with second-order dynamics in unknown environments with bounded wind disturbances in which the vehicle only relies on its on-board distance sensors and communication with other vehicles to navigate.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed algorithm generates smooth trajectories and can be used with high-level planners and low-level motion controllers.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm computes a maximum safe cruise velocity for the vehicle in the environment and guarantees that the trajectory does not violate the vehicle's thrust limitation, sensor constraints, or user-defined clearance radius around other vehicles and obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, the trajectories are guaranteed to reach a stationary goal position in finite time given a finite number of bounded obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation results demonstrate the algorithm properties through two scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
First, a quadrotor navigating through a moving obstacle field to a goal position and, second, multiple quadrotors navigating into a building to different goal positions.	Semantic Scholar
Supplementary information has been proven to be particularly useful in many machine learning tasks.	Semantic Scholar
In ensemble learning for a set of trained base classifiers, there also exists abundant implicit supplementary information about the performance orderings for the trained base classifiers in previous literature.	Semantic Scholar
However, few classifier ensemble studies consider exploring and utilizing supplementary information.	Semantic Scholar
The current study proposes a new learning method for stack classifier ensembles by considering the implicit supplementary ordering information regarding a set of trained classifiers.	Semantic Scholar
First, a new metric learning algorithm for measuring the similarities between two arbitrary learning tasks is introduced.	Semantic Scholar
Second, supplementary ordering information for the trained classifiers of a given learning task is inferred based on the learned similarities and related performance results reported in the previous literature.	Semantic Scholar
Third, a set of ordered soft constraints is generated based on the supplementary ordering information, and achieving the optimal combination weights of the trained classifiers is formalized into a goal programming problem.	Semantic Scholar
The optimal combination weights are then obtained.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed new classifier ensemble method.	Semantic Scholar
Using swarm robotics system, with one or more faulty robots, to accomplish specific tasks may lead to degradation in performances complying with the target requirements.	Semantic Scholar
In such circumstances, robot swarms require continuous monitoring to detect abnormal events and to sustain normal operations.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, an innovative exogenous fault detection method for monitoring robots swarm is presented.	Semantic Scholar
The method merges the flexibility of principal component analysis (PCA) models and the greater sensitivity of the exponentiallyweighted moving average (EWMA) and cumulative sum (CUSUM) control charts to insidious changes.	Semantic Scholar
The method is tested and evaluated on a swarm of simulated foot-bot robots performing a circle formation task, via the viscoelastic control model.	Semantic Scholar
We illustrate through simulated data collected from the ARGoS simulator that a significant improvement in fault detection can be obtained by using the proposed method where compared to the conventional PCA-based methods (i.e., T 2 and Q).	Semantic Scholar
Process measurements are of vital importance for monitoring and control of industrial plants.	Semantic Scholar
When we consider offshore oil production platforms, wells that require gas-lift technology to yield oil production from low pressure oil reservoirs can become unstable under some conditions.	Semantic Scholar
This undesirable phenomenon is usually called slugging flow, and can be identified by an oscillatory behavior of the downhole pressure measurement.	Semantic Scholar
Given the importance of this measurement and the unreliability of the related sensor, this work aims at designing data-driven soft-sensors for downhole pressure estimation in two contexts: one for speeding up first-principle model simulation of a vertical riser model; and another for estimating the downhole pressure using real-world data from an oil well from Petrobras based only on topside platform measurements.	Semantic Scholar
Both tasks are tackled by employing Echo State Networks (ESN) as an efficient technique for training Recurrent Neural Networks.	Semantic Scholar
We show that a single ESN is capable of robustly modeling both the slugging flow behavior and a steady state based only on a square wave input signal representing the production choke opening in the vertical riser.	Semantic Scholar
Besides, we compare the performance of a standard network to the performance of a multiple timescale hierarchical architecture in the second task and show that the latter architecture performs better in modeling both large irregular transients and more commonly occurring small oscillations.	Semantic Scholar
We develop a hybrid system architecture that enables a team of mobile robots to complete a task in a complex environment by self-organizing into a multihop ad hoc network and solving the concurrent communication and mobility problem.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed system consists of a two-layer feedback loop.	Semantic Scholar
An outer loop performs infrequent global coordination and a local inner loop determines motion and communication variables.	Semantic Scholar
This system provides the lightweight coordination and responsiveness of decentralized systems while avoiding local minima.	Semantic Scholar
This allows a team to complete a task in complex environments while maintaining desired end-to-end data rates.	Semantic Scholar
The behavior of the system is evaluated in experiments that demonstrate: 1) successful task completion in complex environments; 2) achievement of equal or greater end-to-end data rates as compared to a centralized system; and 3) robustness to unexpected events such as motion restriction.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a viable framework that integrates control, estimation of unknown payload, safety management, and obstacle avoidance for cooperative transportation in unknown environments using multiple aerial manipulators.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike existing approaches for cooperative manipulation based on force decomposition or impedance-based control that often require heavy or expensive force/torque sensors, this letter suggests a method without such sensors, by exploiting the decentralized dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
First, an online estimator is designed to estimate the mass and inertial properties of an unknown payload, and an adaptive controller based on the estimated parameter is developed.	Semantic Scholar
For planning, trajectory in joint space is generated to satisfy unilateral constraints for safety, and dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) modify the trajectory to avoid obstacles on the fly.	Semantic Scholar
By integration of these components, the proposed framework can be executed in real time.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed framework is validated with experiments using camera-equipped aerial manipulators combined with a two-degree of freedom robotic arm in environments containing obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that the proposed approach can be utilized for safe cooperative aerial transportation in realistic environments.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a fractional-order neural network system with time-varying delays and reaction-diffusion terms.	Semantic Scholar
We first develop a new Mittag-Leffler synchronization strategy for the controlled nodes via impulsive controllers.	Semantic Scholar
Using the fractional Lyapunov method sufficient conditions are given.	Semantic Scholar
We also study the global Mittag-Leffler synchronization of two identical fractional impulsive reaction-diffusion neural networks using linear controllers, which was an open problem even for integer-order models.	Semantic Scholar
Since the Mittag-Leffler stability notion is a generalization of the exponential stability concept for fractional-order systems, our results extend and improve the exponential impulsive control theory of neural network system with time-varying delays and reaction-diffusion terms to the fractional-order case.	Semantic Scholar
The fractional-order derivatives allow us to model the long-term memory in the neural networks, and thus the present research provides with a conceptually straightforward mathematical representation of rather complex processes.	Semantic Scholar
Illustrative examples are presented to show the validity of the obtained results.	Semantic Scholar
We show that by means of appropriate impulsive controllers we can realize the stability goal and to control the qualitative behavior of the states.	Semantic Scholar
An image encryption scheme is extended using fractional derivatives.	Semantic Scholar
This paper investigates O(t-α)-synchronization and adaptive Mittag-Leffler synchronization for the fractional-order memristive neural networks with delays and discontinuous neuron activations.	Semantic Scholar
Firstly, based on the framework of Filippov solution and differential inclusion theory, using a Razumikhin-type method, some sufficient conditions ensuring the global O(t-α)-synchronization of considered networks are established via a linear-type discontinuous control.	Semantic Scholar
Next, a new fractional differential inequality is established and two new discontinuous adaptive controller is designed to achieve Mittag-Leffler synchronization between the drive system and the response systems using this inequality.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, two numerical simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach and theoretical results have a leading significance in the design of synchronized fractional-order memristive neural networks circuits involving discontinuous activations and time-varying delays.	Semantic Scholar
Design automation of industrial grippers is a hot research topic for robot industries.	Semantic Scholar

"Given a large dataset of binary codes and a binary query point, we address how to efficiently find <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$K$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""eghbali-ieq1-2828095.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> codes in the dataset that yield the largest cosine similarities to the query."	Semantic Scholar
The straightforward answer to this problem is to compare the query with all items in the dataset, but this is practical only for small datasets.	Semantic Scholar
One potential solution to enhance the search time and achieve sublinear cost is to use a hash table populated with binary codes of the dataset and then look up the nearby buckets to the query to retrieve the nearest neighbors.	Semantic Scholar
However, if codes are compared in terms of cosine similarity rather than the Hamming distance, then the main issue is that the order of buckets to probe is not evident.	Semantic Scholar
To examine this issue, we first elaborate on the connection between the Hamming distance and the cosine similarity.	Semantic Scholar
Doing this allows us to systematically find the probing sequence in the hash table.	Semantic Scholar
However, solving the nearest neighbor search with a single table is only practical for short binary codes.	Semantic Scholar
To address this issue, we propose the angular multi-index hashing search algorithm which relies on building multiple hash tables on binary code substrings.	Semantic Scholar
"The proposed search algorithm solves the exact angular <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$K$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""eghbali-ieq2-2828095.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> nearest neighbor problem in a time that is often orders of magnitude faster than the linear scan baseline and even approximation methods."

Even though it would be desirable for most postprocessing purposes to obtain a point cloud without moving objects in it, it is often impractical or downright impossible to free a scene from all nonstatic clutter.	Semantic Scholar
Outdoor environments contain pedestrians, bicycles, and motor vehicles which cannot easily be stopped from entering the sensor range and indoor environments like factory production lines cannot be evacuated due to production losses during the time of the scan.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a solution to this problem that we call the “peopleremover.” Given a registered set of 3-D point clouds, we build a regular voxel occupancy grid and then traverse it along the lines of sight between the sensor and the measured points to find the differences in volumetric occupancy between the scans.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach works for scan slices from mobile mapping as well as for the more general scenario of terrestrial scan data.	Semantic Scholar
The result is a clean point cloud free of dynamic objects.	Semantic Scholar
Intracortical brain computer interfaces can enable individuals with paralysis to control external devices through voluntarily modulated brain activity.	Semantic Scholar
Decoding quality has been previously shown to degrade with signal nonstationarities—specifically, the changes in the statistics of the data between training and testing data sets.	Semantic Scholar
This includes changes to the neural tuning profiles and baseline shifts in firing rates of recorded neurons, as well as nonphysiological noise.	Semantic Scholar
While progress has been made toward providing long-term user control via decoder recalibration, relatively little work has been dedicated to making the decoding algorithm more resilient to signal nonstationarities.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we describe how principled kernel selection with gaussian process regression can be used within a Bayesian filtering framework to mitigate the effects of commonly encountered nonstationarities.	Semantic Scholar
Given a supervised training set of (neural features, intention to move in a direction)-pairs, we use gaussian process regression to predict the intention given the neural data.	Semantic Scholar
We apply kernel embedding for each neural feature with the standard radial basis function.	Semantic Scholar
The multiple kernels are then summed together across each neural dimension, which allows the kernel to effectively ignore large differences that occur only in a single feature.	Semantic Scholar
The summed kernel is used for real-time predictions of the posterior mean and variance under a gaussian process framework.	Semantic Scholar
The predictions are then filtered using the discriminative Kalman filter to produce an estimate of the neural intention given the history of neural data.	Semantic Scholar
We refer to the multiple kernel approach combined with the discriminative Kalman filter as the MK-DKF.	Semantic Scholar
We found that the MK-DKF decoder was more resilient to nonstationarities frequently encountered in-real world settings yet provided similar performance to the currently used Kalman decoder.	Semantic Scholar
These results demonstrate a method by which neural decoding can be made more resistant to nonstationarities.	Semantic Scholar
This paper addresses a remaining gap between today's academic catching robots and their future in industrial applications: reliable task execution.	Semantic Scholar
A novel parameterization is derived to reduce the three-dimensional (3-D) catching problem to 1-D on the ballistic flight path.	Semantic Scholar
Vice versa, an efficient dynamical system formulation allows reconstruction of solutions from 1-D to 3-D.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, the body of the work in hybrid dynamical systems theory, in particular on the 1-D bouncing ball problem, becomes available for robotic catching.	Semantic Scholar
Uniform Zeno asymptotic stability from bouncing ball literature is adapted, as an example, and extended to fit the catching problem.	Semantic Scholar
A quantitative stability measure and the importance of the initial relative state between the object and end-effector are discussed.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, constrained dynamic optimization maximizes convergence speed while satisfying all kinematic and dynamic limits.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, for the first time, a quantitative success-oriented comparison of catching motions becomes available.	Semantic Scholar
The feasible and optimal solution is then validated on two symmetric robots autonomously playing throw and catch.	Semantic Scholar

Information-theoretic measures are estimated on pairings of variables to unveil nonlinear interactions that structure the agent-environment system.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, the mutual information is utilized to quantify the degree of dependence and the transfer entropy to detect the direction of the information flow.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the system is analyzed with the local form of such measures, thus capturing the underlying dynamics of information.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that different measures are interdependent and complementary in uncovering aspects of the robots' interaction with the environment, as well as characteristics of the functional neural structure.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, the set of information-theoretic measures provides a decomposition of the system, capturing the intricacy of nonlinear relationships that characterize robots' behavior and neural dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
The advances in soft robotics have increased the need of soft sensors in various applications involved with physical interactions between humans and robots.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a soft multiaxis force sensor made of multimaterial elastomer layers and embedded microfluidic channels that are sensitive to compression perpendicular to the channel length.	Semantic Scholar
The microchannels are geometrically divided into multiple segments for detecting forces in three axes.	Semantic Scholar
When a force is applied to the top surface of the sensor, the microchannels are compressed by multisegmented force plates made of rigid plastic.	Semantic Scholar
While the microchannels located on the sides in the structure detect shear forces, the microchannel at the bottom detects normal force.	Semantic Scholar
The three-dimensional configuration of the microchannel physically separates the side channels from the bottom channel and consequently enables mechanical decoupling of shear forces from normal force.	Semantic Scholar

Computer vision algorithms are often limited in their application by the large amount of data that must be processed.	Semantic Scholar
Mammalian vision systems mitigate this high bandwidth requirement by prioritizing certain regions of the visual field with neural circuits that select the most salient regions.	Semantic Scholar
This work introduces a novel and computationally efficient visual saliency algorithm for performing this neuromorphic attention-based data reduction.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed algorithm has the added advantage that it is compatible with an analog CMOS design while still achieving comparable performance to existing state-of-the-art saliency algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
This compatibility allows for direct integration with the analog-to-digital conversion circuitry present in CMOS image sensors.	Semantic Scholar
This integration leads to power savings in the converter by quantizing only the salient pixels.	Semantic Scholar
Further system-level power savings are gained by reducing the amount of data that must be transmitted and processed in the digital domain.	Semantic Scholar
The analog CMOS compatible formulation relies on a pulse width (i.e., time mode) encoding of the pixel data that is compatible with pulse-mode imagers and slope based converters often used in imager designs.	Semantic Scholar

Next, the proposed algorithm is derived.	Semantic Scholar
Hardware-oriented optimizations and modifications to this algorithm are proposed and discussed.	Semantic Scholar
Next, a metric for quantifying saliency accuracy is proposed, and simulation results of this metric are presented.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, an analog synthesis approach for a time-mode architecture is outlined, and postsynthesis transistor-level simulations that demonstrate functionality of an implementation in a modern CMOS process are discussed.	Semantic Scholar
Firing-rate dynamics have been hypothesized to mediate inter-neural information transfer in the brain.	Semantic Scholar
While the Hebbian paradigm, relating learning and memory to firing activity, has put synaptic efficacy variation at the center of cortical plasticity, we suggest that the external expression of plasticity by changes in the firing-rate dynamics represents a more general notion of plasticity.	Semantic Scholar
Hypothesizing that time constants of plasticity and firing dynamics increase with age, and employing the filtering property of the neuron, we obtain the elementary code of global attractors associated with the firing-rate dynamics in each developmental stage.	Semantic Scholar
We define a neural circuit connectivity code as an indivisible set of circuit structures generated by membrane and synapse activation and silencing.	Semantic Scholar
Synchronous firing patterns under parameter uniformity, and asynchronous circuit firing are shown to be driven, respectively, by membrane and synapse silencing and reactivation, and maintained by the neuronal filtering property.	Semantic Scholar
Analytic, graphical and simulation representation of the discrete iteration maps and of the global attractor codes of neural firing rate are found to be consistent with previous empirical neurobiological findings, which have lacked, however, a specific correspondence between firing modes, time constants, circuit connectivity and cortical developmental stages.

The letter takes the first step toward the development of a control framework for underactuated flying humanoid robots.	Semantic Scholar
These robots may thus have the capacities of flight, contact locomotion, and manipulation, and benefit from technologies and methods developed for Whole-Body Control  and Aerial Manipulation.	Semantic Scholar
As in the case of quadrotors, we assume that the humanoid robot is powered by four thrust forces.	Semantic Scholar
For convenience, these forces are placed at the robot hands and feet.	Semantic Scholar
The control objective is defined as the asymptotic stabilization of the robot centroidal momentum.	Semantic Scholar
This objective allows us to track a desired trajectory for the robot center of mass and keep small errors between a reference orientation and the robot base frame.	Semantic Scholar
Stability and convergence of the robot momentum are shown to be in the sense of Lyapunov.	Semantic Scholar
Simulations carried out on a model of the humanoid robot iCub verify the soundness of the proposed approach.	Semantic Scholar

Many applications depend on solving the satisfiability of formulæ involving propositional logic and first-order theories, a problem known as Satisfiability Modulo Theory.	Semantic Scholar
This article presents a new method for satisfiability modulo a combination of theories, named CDSAT, for Conflict-Driven SATisfiability.	Semantic Scholar
CDSAT also solves Satisfiability Modulo Assignment problems that may include assignments to first-order terms.	Semantic Scholar
A conflict-driven procedure assigns values to variables to build a model, and performs inferences on demand in order to solve conflicts between assignments and formulæ.	Semantic Scholar
CDSAT extends this paradigm to generic combinations of disjoint theories, each characterized by a collection of inference rules called theory module.	Semantic Scholar
CDSAT coordinates the theory modules in such a way that the conflict-driven reasoning happens in the union of the theories, not only in propositional logic.	Semantic Scholar
As there is no fixed hierarchy with propositional logic at the center and the other theories as satellites, CDSAT offers a flexible framework for model search.	Semantic Scholar
We prove the soundness, completeness, and termination of CDSAT, identifying sufficient requirements on theories and modules that ensure these properties.	Semantic Scholar

Inspired from parallel manipulators, this flying robot is composed of three quadrotors linked by a rigid articulated architecture composed of three legs and a platform.	Semantic Scholar
Associating quadrotor comanipulation and rigid bodies, this new design offers novel possibilities for aerial robotics and manipulation.	Semantic Scholar
Previous work leads to the design of a flying parallel robot with two quadrotors.	Semantic Scholar
However, this robot did not allow the full control of the six degrees of freedom of its end-effector.	Semantic Scholar
With an additional quadrotor, this study seeks to obtain a full control of the platform position and orientation.	Semantic Scholar
To prove this property, the kinematic constraints are verified through screw theory.	Semantic Scholar

The neocognitron is a deep (multi-layered) convolutional neural network that can be trained to recognize visual patterns robustly.	Semantic Scholar
In the intermediate layers of the neocognitron, local features are extracted from input patterns.	Semantic Scholar
In the deepest layer, based on the features extracted in the intermediate layers, input patterns are classified into classes.	Semantic Scholar
A method called IntVec (interpolating-vector) is used for this purpose.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a new learning rule called margined Winner-Take-All (mWTA) for training the deepest layer.	Semantic Scholar
Every time when a training pattern is presented during the learning, if the result of recognition by WTA (Winner-Take-All) is an error, a new cell is generated in the deepest layer.	Semantic Scholar
Here we put a certain amount of margin to the WTA.	Semantic Scholar
In other words, only during the learning, a certain amount of handicap is given to cells of classes other than that of the training vector, and the winner is chosen under this handicap.	Semantic Scholar
By introducing the margin to the WTA, we can generate a compact set of cells, with which a high recognition rate can be obtained with a small computational cost.	Semantic Scholar
The ability of this mWTA is demonstrated by computer simulation.	Semantic Scholar
Recent advances in engineering and signal processing have renewed the interest in invasive and surface brain recordings, yet many features of cortical field potentials remain incompletely understood.	Semantic Scholar
In the computational study that follows, we show that a model circuit of interneurons, coupled via both GABAA receptor synapses and electrical synapses, reproduces many essential features of the power spectrum of local field potential (LFP) recordings, such as 1/f power scaling at low frequency (below 10 Hz), power accumulation in the γ-frequency band (30–100 Hz), and a robust α rhythm in the absence of stimulation.	Semantic Scholar
The low-frequency 1/f power scaling depends on strong reciprocal inhibition, whereas the α rhythm is generated by electrical coupling of intrinsically active neurons.	Semantic Scholar
As in previous studies, the γ power arises through the amplification of single-neuron spectral properties, owing to the refractory period, by parameters that favor neuronal synchrony, such as delayed inhibition.	Semantic Scholar
This study also confirms that both synaptic and voltage-gated membrane currents contribute substantially to the LFP and that high-frequency signals such as action potentials quickly taper off with distance.	Semantic Scholar
Given the ubiquity of electrically coupled interneuron circuits in the mammalian brain, they may be major determinants of the recorded potentials.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a new image-based visual servoing approach that simultaneously solves the feature correspondence and control problem.	Semantic Scholar
Using a finite-time optimal control framework, feature correspondence is implicitly solved for each new image during the control selection, alleviating the need for additional image processing and feature tracking.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach demonstrates mild robustness properties and leads to acceptable or improved image feature behavior and robot trajectories compared to classical image-based visual servoing, particularly for underactuated robots.	Semantic Scholar
As such, preliminary experimental results using a small unmanned quadrotor are also presented.	Semantic Scholar

The embedded PULP accelerator enables state-of-the-art context classification based on convolutional neural networks to be applied within a sub-10-mW system power envelope.	Semantic Scholar
Our methodology enables to reach high accuracy in context classification over five classes (up to 84%, with three classes over five reaching more than 90% accuracy), while consuming 2.2 mJ per classification, or an ultralow energy consumption of less than 91 μJ per classification with an accuracy of 64%-3.2× better than chance.

To our knowledge it is the first time that an exact sphere localization formula is published that only uses the (pixel) area and the ellipse center of the sphere image.	Semantic Scholar
Other authors either derived an approximation formula or followed the less robust and more time consuming procedure of fitting an ellipse through the detected edge pixels.	Semantic Scholar
Our method is analytic and deterministic, making use of the unique positive real tool of a cubic equation.	Semantic Scholar
We observe that the proposed area method is significantly more accurate and precise than an ellipse fitting method.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we investigate in what conditions for sphere images the proposed exact method is preferable to the robust approximation method.	Semantic Scholar

Under the one-side Lipschitz condition or the linear growth condition of activation function, the existence of solution is analyzed respectively.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the existence, uniqueness and global Mittag-Leffler stability of equilibrium point of the fractional-order impulsive neural networks with one-side Lipschitz condition are investigated by the means of contraction mapping principle and Lyapunov direct method.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, an example with numerical simulation is given to illustrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed results.	Semantic Scholar
While much work has focused on the design of actuators for inputting energy into robotic systems, less work has been dedicated to devices that remove energy in a controlled manner, especially in the field of soft robotics.	Semantic Scholar
Such devices have the potential to significantly modulate the dynamics of a system with very low required input power.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we leverage the concept of layer jamming, previously used for variable stiffness devices, to create a controllable, high force density, soft layer jamming brake (SLJB).	Semantic Scholar
We introduce the design, modeling, and performance analysis of the SLJB and demonstrate variable tensile resisting forces through the regulation of vacuum pressure.	Semantic Scholar
Further, we measure and model the tensile force with respect to different layer materials, vacuum pressures, and lengthening velocities, and show its ability to absorb energy during collisions.	Semantic Scholar
We hope to apply the SLJB in a number of applications in wearable technology.	Semantic Scholar
Physiological rhythms play a critical role in the functional development of living beings.	Semantic Scholar
Many biological functions are executed with an interaction of rhythms produced by internal characteristics of scores of cells.	Semantic Scholar
While synchronized oscillations may be associated with normal brain functions, anomalies in these oscillations may cause or relate the emergence of some neurological or neuropsychological pathologies.	Semantic Scholar
This study was designed to investigate the effects of topological structure and synaptic conductivity noise on the spatial synchronization and temporal rhythmicity of the waves generated by cells in the network.	Semantic Scholar
Because of holding the ability of clustering and randomizing with change of parameters, small-world (SW) network topology was chosen.	Semantic Scholar
The oscillatory activity of network was tried out by manipulating an insulated SW, cortical network model whose morphology is very close to real world.	Semantic Scholar
According to the obtained results, it was observed that at the optimal probabilistic rates of conductivity noise and rewiring of SW, powerful synchronized oscillatory small waves are generated in relation to the internal dynamics of cells, which are in line with the network’s input.	Semantic Scholar
These two parameters were observed to be quite effective on the excitation-inhibition balance of the network.	Semantic Scholar
Accordingly, it may be suggested that the topological dynamics of SW and noisy synaptic conductivity may be associated with the normal and abnormal development of neurobiological structure.	Semantic Scholar
We consider group identification models in which the aggregation of individual opinions concerning who is qualified in a given society determines the set of socially qualified persons.	Semantic Scholar
In this setting, we study the extent to which social qualification can be changed when societies expand, shrink, or partition themselves.	Semantic Scholar
The answers we provide are with respect to the computational complexity of the corresponding control problems and fully cover the class of consent aggregation rules introduced by Samet and Schmeidler (J Econ Theory, 110(2):213–233, 2003) as well as procedural rules for group identification.	Semantic Scholar
We obtain both polynomial-time solvability results and NP-hardness results.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we also study these problems from the parameterized complexity perspective, and obtain some fixed-parameter tractability results.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a system capable of inferring intent from observed vehicles traversing an unsignalized intersection, a task critical for the safe driving of autonomous vehicles, and beneficial for advanced driver assistance systems.	Semantic Scholar
We present a prediction method based on recurrent neural networks that takes data from a Lidar-based tracking system similar to those expected in future smart vehicles.	Semantic Scholar
The model is validated on a roundabout, a popular style of unsignalized intersection in urban areas.	Semantic Scholar
We also present a very large naturalistic dataset recorded in a typical intersection during two days of operation.	Semantic Scholar
This comprehensive dataset is used to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm introduced in this letter.	Semantic Scholar
The system produces excellent results, giving a significant 1.3-s prediction window before any potential conflict occurs.	Semantic Scholar

The aim is to synthesize control inputs for robotic manipulator arms that ensure a desired task specification is executed while optimizing a desired performance objective.	Semantic Scholar
We use metric temporal logic (MTL) to express the task specifications defined in terms of manipulating objects and implemented a hierarchical method combining mixed integer-linear programming (at high-level) to obtain a candidate MTL task specification defined in terms of the location of the arm end-effector and gradient descent based optimization (at low-level) for automatic synthesis of the motion plans to execute such candidate task specifications.	Semantic Scholar
The gradient descent algorithm is performed over the feasible input space to optimize the manipulator arm trajectory from a given arbitrary initial condition to perform the task at hand.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by simulating a task specification on a Baxter robot.	Semantic Scholar
Although a number of solutions exist for the problems of coverage, search, and target localization—commonly addressed separately—whether there exists a unified strategy that addresses these objectives in a coherent manner without being application specific remains a largely open research question.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we develop a receding-horizon ergodic control approach, based on hybrid systems theory, that has the potential to fill this gap.	Semantic Scholar
The nonlinear model-predictive control algorithm plans real-time motions that optimally improve ergodicity with respect to a distribution defined by the expected information density across the sensing domain.	Semantic Scholar
We establish a theoretical framework for global stability guarantees with respect to a distribution.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the approach is distributable across multiple agents so that each agent can independently compute its own control while sharing statistics of its coverage across a communication network.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the method in both simulation and in experiment in the context of target localization, illustrating that the algorithm is independent of the number of targets being tracked and can be run in real time on computationally limited hardware platforms.	Semantic Scholar
Stock market volatility is influenced by information release, dissemination, and public acceptance.	Semantic Scholar
With the increasing volume and speed of social media, the effects of Web information on stock markets are becoming increasingly salient.	Semantic Scholar
However, studies of the effects of Web media on stock markets lack both depth and breadth due to the challenges in automatically acquiring and analyzing massive amounts of relevant information.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we systematically reviewed 229 research articles on quantifying the interplay between Web media and stock markets from the fields of Finance, Management Information Systems, and Computer Science.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we first categorized the representative works in terms of media type and then summarized the core techniques for converting textual information into machine-friendly forms.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we compared the analysis models used to capture the hidden relationships between Web media and stock movements.	Semantic Scholar
Our goal is to clarify current cutting-edge research and its possible future directions to fully understand the mechanisms of Web information percolation and its impact on stock markets from the perspectives of investors cognitive behaviors, corporate governance, and stock market regulation.

We address the problem of planning a path for a ground robot through unknown terrain, using observations from a flying robot.	Semantic Scholar
In search and rescue missions, which are our target scenarios, the time from arrival at the disaster site to the delivery of aid is critically important.	Semantic Scholar
Previous works required exhaustive exploration before path planning, which is time-consuming but eventually leads to an optimal path for the ground robot.	Semantic Scholar
Instead, we propose active exploration of the environment, where the flying robot chooses regions to map in a way that optimizes the overall response time of the system, which is the combined time for the air and ground robots to execute their missions.	Semantic Scholar
In our approach, we estimate terrain classes throughout our terrain map, and we also add elevation information in areas where the active exploration algorithm has chosen to perform 3-D reconstruction.	Semantic Scholar
This terrain information is used to estimate feasible and efficient paths for the ground robot.	Semantic Scholar
By exploring the environment actively, we achieve superior response times compared to both exhaustive and greedy exploration strategies.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the performance and capabilities of the proposed system in simulated and real-world outdoor experiments.	Semantic Scholar
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address ground robot path planning using active aerial exploration.	Semantic Scholar
This paper introduces Fourier-approximated Lie algebras for shooting (FLASH), a fast geodesic shooting algorithm for diffeomorphic image registration.	Semantic Scholar
We approximate the infinite-dimensional Lie algebra of smooth vector fields, i.e., the tangent space at the identity of the diffeomorphism group, with a low-dimensional, bandlimited space.	Semantic Scholar
We show that most of the computations for geodesic shooting can be carried out entirely in this low-dimensional space.	Semantic Scholar
Our algorithm results in dramatic savings in time and memory over traditional large-deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping algorithms, which require dense spatial discretizations of vector fields.	Semantic Scholar
To validate the effectiveness of FLASH, we run pairwise image registration on both 2D synthetic data and real 3D brain images and compare with the state-of-the-art geodesic shooting methods.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that our algorithm dramatically reduces the computational cost and memory footprint of diffemorphic image registration with little or no loss of accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a variation of traditional supervised learning problems where data (referred to as bags) are composed of sub-elements (referred to as instances) and only bag labels are available.	Semantic Scholar
MIL has a variety of applications such as content-based image retrieval, text categorization, and medical diagnosis.	Semantic Scholar
Most of the previous work for MIL assume that training bags are fully labeled.	Semantic Scholar
However, it is often difficult to obtain an enough number of labeled bags in practical situations, while many unlabeled bags are available.	Semantic Scholar
A learning framework called PU classification (positive and unlabeled classification) can address this problem.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a convex PU classification method to solve an MIL problem.	Semantic Scholar
We experimentally show that the proposed method achieves better performance with significantly lower computation costs than an existing method for PU-MIL.	Semantic Scholar
Person re-identification is a crucial problem for video surveillance, aiming to discover the correct matches for a probe person image from a set of gallery person images.	Semantic Scholar
To directly describe the image pair, we present a novel organization of polynomial kernel feature map in a high dimensional feature space to break down the variability of positive person pairs.	Semantic Scholar
An exemplar-guided similarity function is built on the map, which consists of multiple sub-functions.	Semantic Scholar
Each sub-function is associated with an “exemplar” image being responsible for a particular type of image pair, thus excels at separating the persons with similar appearance.	Semantic Scholar
We formulate a unified learning problem including a relaxed loss term as well as two kinds of regularization strategies particularly designed for the feature map.	Semantic Scholar
The corresponding optimization algorithm jointly optimizes the coefficients of all the sub-functions and selects the proper exemplars for a better discrimination.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method is extensively evaluated on six public datasets, where we thoroughly analyze the contribution of each component and verify the generalizability of our approach by cross-dataset experiments.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that the new method can achieve consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
Place recognition, or loop closure detection, is an essential component to address the problem of visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).	Semantic Scholar
Long-term navigation of robots in outdoor environments introduces new challenges to enable life-long SLAM, including the strong appearance change resulting from vegetation, weather, and illumination variations across various times of the day, different days, months, or even seasons.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a new shared representative appearance learning (SRAL) approach to address long-term visual place recognition.	Semantic Scholar
Different from previous methods using a single feature modality or a concatenation of multiple features, our SRAL method autonomously learns representative features that are shared in all scene scenarios, and then fuses the features together to represent the long-term appearance of environments observed by a robot during life-long navigation.	Semantic Scholar
By formulating SRAL as a regularized optimization problem, we use structured sparsity-inducing norms to model interrelationships of feature modalities.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, an optimization algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the formulated optimization problem, which holds a theoretical convergence guarantee.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive empirical study was performed to evaluate the SRAL method using large-scale benchmark datasets, including St Lucia, CMU-VL, and Nordland datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results have shown that our SRAL method obtains superior performance for life-long place recognition using individual images, outperforms previous single image-based methods, and is capable of estimating the importance of feature modalities.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, global exponential synchronization of multiple coupled inertial memristive neural networks with time-varying delay is investigated.	Semantic Scholar
First, by choosing suitable variable substitution, the inertial memristive neural networks are transformed into first-order differential equations.	Semantic Scholar
Next, a novel coupling scheme with linear diffusive term and discontinuous sign function term depending on the first order derivative of state variables is introduced.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this coupling scheme, several sufficient conditions for global exponential synchronization of multiple inertial memristive neural networks are derived by using Lyapunov stability theory and some inequality techniques.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, several numerical examples are presented to substantiate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.	Semantic Scholar
Ophthalmic microsurgery is known to be a challenging operation, which requires very precise and dexterous manipulation.	Semantic Scholar
Image guided robot-assisted surgery is a promising solution that brings significant improvements in outcomes and reduces the physical limitations of human surgeons.	Semantic Scholar
However, this technology must be further developed before it can be routinely used in clinics.	Semantic Scholar
One of the problems is the lack of proper calibration between the robotic manipulator and appropriate imaging device.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we developed a flexible framework for hand-eye calibration of an ophthalmic robot with a microscope-integrated optical coherence tomography (OCT) without any markers.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method consists of three main steps are following: First, we estimate the OCT calibration parameters; second, with micro-scale displacements controlled by the robot, we detect and segment the needle tip in three-dimensional OCT volume and; finally, we find the transformation between the coordinate system of the OCT camera and the coordinate system of the robot.	Semantic Scholar
We verified the capability of our framework in ex-vivo pig eye experiments and compared the results with a reference method (marker-based).	Semantic Scholar
In all experiments, our method showed a small difference from the marker based method, with a mean calibration error of 9.2 μm and 7.0 μm, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, the noise test shows the robustness of the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
Tendons in tendon-driven mechanisms are relatively weak components and sometimes break.	Semantic Scholar
This letter proposes a detection method of tendon breakage and a switching control system for tendon-driven mechanisms with redundant tendons.	Semantic Scholar
The detection method immediately detects the tendon breakage from the kinematic information of the tendons.	Semantic Scholar
The switching control system compensates the control performance by only using the remaining tendons.	Semantic Scholar
We experimentally confirm that the virtual tendon stretch in the breakage case is adequately large to detect the breakage from kinematic information.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments also confirm that the switching controller improves the tracking performance when a tendon is broken.	Semantic Scholar
Two-dimensional principal component analysis (2DPCA) employs squared F-norm as the distance metric for dimensionality reduction.	Semantic Scholar
It is commonly known that squared F-norm is sensitive to the presence of outliers.	Semantic Scholar
To address this problem, we use F-norm instead of squared F-norm as the distance metric in the objective function and develop a non-greedy algorithm, which has a closed-form solution in each iteration and can maximize the criterion function, to solve the optimal solution.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach not only is robust to outliers but also well characterizes the geometric structure of data.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on several face databases illustrate that our method is more effective and robust than the other robust 2DPCA algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
We present an approach to simultaneously perform semantic segmentation and prepositional phrase attachment resolution for captioned images.	Semantic Scholar
Some ambiguities in language cannot be resolved without simultaneously reasoning about an associated image.	Semantic Scholar
If we consider the sentence “I shot an elephant in my pajamas”, looking at language alone (and not using common sense), it is unclear if it is the person or the elephant wearing the pajamas or both.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach produces a diverse set of plausible hypotheses for both semantic segmentation and prepositional phrase attachment resolution that are then jointly re-ranked to select the most consistent pair.	Semantic Scholar
We show that our semantic segmentation and prepositional phrase attachment resolution modules have complementary strengths, and that joint reasoning produces more accurate results than any module operating in isolation.	Semantic Scholar
Multiple hypotheses are also shown to be crucial to improved multiplemodule reasoning.	Semantic Scholar
Our vision and language approach significantly outperforms the Stanford Parser [1] by 17.91% (28.69% relative) and 12.83% (25.28% relative) in two different experiments.	Semantic Scholar
We also make small improvements over DeepLabCRF [2].	Semantic Scholar
Manifold based feature extraction has been proved to be an effective technique in dealing with the unsupervised classification tasks.	Semantic Scholar
However, most of the existing works cannot guarantee the global optimum of the learned projection, and they are sensitive to different noises.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, many methods cannot catch the discriminative information as much as possible since they only exploit the local structure of data while ignoring the global structure.	Semantic Scholar
To address the above problems, this paper proposes a novel graph based feature extraction method named low-rank and sparsity preserving embedding (LRSPE) for unsupervised learning.	Semantic Scholar
LRSPE attempts to simultaneously learn the graph and projection in a framework so that the global optimal projection can be obtained.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, LRSPE exploits both global and local information of data for projection learning by imposing the low-rank and sparse constraints on the graph, which promotes the method to obtain a better performance.	Semantic Scholar
Importantly, LRSPE is more robust to noise by imposing the l2,1 sparsity norm on the reconstruction errors.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on both clean and noisy datasets prove that the proposed method can significantly improve classification accuracy and it is robust to different noises in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a case study of a learning-based approach for target-driven mapless navigation.	Semantic Scholar
The underlying navigation model is an end-to-end neural network, which is trained using a combination of expert demonstrations, imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL).	Semantic Scholar
While RL and IL suffer from a large sample complexity and the distribution mismatch problem, respectively, we show that leveraging prior expert demonstrations for pretraining can reduce the training time to reach at least the same level of the performance compared to plain RL by a factor of 5.	Semantic Scholar
We present a thorough evaluation of different combinations of expert demonstrations, different RL algorithms, and reward functions, both in simulation and on a real robotic platform.	Semantic Scholar
Our results show that the final model outperforms both standalone approaches in the amount of successful navigation tasks.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the RL reward function can be significantly simplified when using pretraining, e.g., by using a sparse reward only.	Semantic Scholar
The learned navigation policy is able to generalize to unseen and real-world environments.	Semantic Scholar
Autonomous robots need to interact with unknown, unstructured and changing environments, constantly facing novel challenges.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, continuous online adaptation for lifelong-learning and the need of sample-efficient mechanisms to adapt to changes in the environment, the constraints, the tasks, or the robot itself are crucial.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we propose a novel framework for probabilistic online motion planning with online adaptation based on a bio-inspired stochastic recurrent neural network.	Semantic Scholar
By using learning signals which mimic the intrinsic motivation signal cognitive dissonance in addition with a mental replay strategy to intensify experiences, the stochastic recurrent network can learn from few physical interactions and adapts to novel environments in seconds.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our online planning and adaptation framework on an anthropomorphic KUKA LWR arm.	Semantic Scholar
The rapid online adaptation is shown by learning unknown workspace constraints sample-efficiently from few physical interactions while following given way points.	Semantic Scholar
A fundamental problem in neuroscience is to characterize the dynamics of spiking from the neurons in a circuit that is involved in learning about a stimulus or a contingency.	Semantic Scholar
A key limitation of current methods to analyze neural spiking data is the need to collapse neural activity over time or trials, which may cause the loss of information pertinent to understanding the function of a neuron or circuit.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce a new method that can determine not only the trial-to-trial dynamics that accompany the learning of a contingency by a neuron, but also the latency of this learning with respect to the onset of a conditioned stimulus.	Semantic Scholar
The backbone of the method is a separable two-dimensional (2D) random field (RF) model of neural spike rasters, in which the joint conditional intensity function of a neuron over time and trials depends on two latent Markovian state sequences that evolve separately but in parallel.	Semantic Scholar
Classical tools to estimate state-space models cannot be applied readily to our 2D separable RF model.	Semantic Scholar
We develop efficient statistical and computational tools to estimate the parameters of the separable 2D RF model.	Semantic Scholar
We apply these to data collected from neurons in the prefrontal cortex in an experiment designed to characterize the neural underpinnings of the associative learning of fear in mice.	Semantic Scholar
Overall, the separable 2D RF model provides a detailed, interpretable characterization of the dynamics of neural spiking that accompany the learning of a contingency.	Semantic Scholar
This paper addresses the development of an efficient information gathering and exploration strategy for robotic missions when a high level of autonomy is expected.	Semantic Scholar
A multi-agent system is considered, which consists of several mobile sensing platforms with the goal to identify the parameters of a spatio-temporal process modeled by a partial differential equation.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, an exploration of a diffusion process driven by an unknown number of sparsely located sources is considered.	Semantic Scholar
A probabilistic approach toward partial differential equations and sparsity constraints modeling with factor graphs is developed and realized by a customized message passing algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm permits efficient identification of source parameters: the number of sources, their locations and amplitudes.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, an exploration strategy to guide the agents to more informative sampling locations is proposed; this accelerates identification of the source parameters.	Semantic Scholar
The message passing implementation facilitates efficient distributed implementation, which is of significant advantage with respect to scalability, computational complexity and an implementation in a multi-agent system.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated using synthetic data in simulations.	Semantic Scholar
String similarity search is a fundamental query that has been widely used for DNA sequencing, error-tolerant query auto-completion, and data cleaning needed in database, data warehouse, and data mining.	Semantic Scholar

In this paper, we study string similarity search where strings can be either short or long.	Semantic Scholar

We discuss our hash-based approaches, address their pruning power, and give the algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Our hash-based approaches achieve high efficiency, and keep its index size and index construction time one order of magnitude smaller than the existing approaches in our experiment at the same time.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a unified formulation of robust learning methods for classification and regression problems.	Semantic Scholar
In the learning methods, the hinge loss is used with outlier indicators in order to detect outliers in the observed data.	Semantic Scholar
To analyze the robustness property, we evaluate the breakdown point of the learning methods in the situation that the outlier ratio is not necessarily small.	Semantic Scholar
Although minimization of the hinge loss with outlier indicators is a non-convex optimization problem, we prove that any local optimal solution of our learning algorithms has the robustness property.	Semantic Scholar
The theoretical findings are confirmed in numerical experiments.	Semantic Scholar
Good tracking performance is in general attributed to accurate representation over previously obtained targets and/or reliable discrimination between the target and the surrounding background.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, a robust tracker is proposed by integrating the advantages of both approaches.	Semantic Scholar
A subspace is constructed to represent the target and the neighboring background, and their class labels are propagated simultaneously via the learned subspace.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, a novel criterion is proposed, by taking account of both the reliability of discrimination and the accuracy of representation, to identify the target from numerous target candidates in each frame.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, the ambiguity in the class labels of neighboring background samples, which influences the reliability of the discriminative tracking model, is effectively alleviated, while the training set still remains small.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms most state-of-the-art trackers.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a weakly supervised regression model for the visual house appraisal problem, which aims to predict the value of a house from its photos and textual descriptions (e.g., number of bedrooms).	Semantic Scholar
The key idea of our approach is a multi-layer neural network, called multi-instance Deep Ranking and Regression  (MiDRR) net, which jointly solves two coupled tasks: ranking and regression, in the multiple instance setting.	Semantic Scholar
The network is trained using weakly supervised data, which do not require intensive human annotations.	Semantic Scholar
We also design a set of human heuristics to promote deep features through imposing constraints over the solution space, e.g., a house with three bedrooms often has a higher value than that with only two bedrooms.	Semantic Scholar
While these constraints are specific to the studied problem, the developed formula can be easily generalized to the other regression applications.	Semantic Scholar
For test and evaluation purposes, we collect a comprehensive house image benchmark that includes 900,000 photos from 30,000 houses recently traded in the USA, and apply the proposed MiDRR net to predict house values.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive evaluations with comparisons demonstrate that additional usage of imagery data as well as human heuristics can significantly boost system performance and that the proposed MiDRR net clearly outperforms the alternative methods.	Semantic Scholar
This paper is concerned with the globally exponential stability problem for a class of discrete-time stochastic memristive neural networks (DSMNNs) with both leakage delays as well as probabilistic time-varying delays.	Semantic Scholar
For the probabilistic delays, a sequence of Bernoulli distributed random variables is utilized to determine within which intervals the time-varying delays fall at certain time instant.	Semantic Scholar
The sector-bounded activation function is considered in the addressed DSMNN.	Semantic Scholar
By taking into account the state-dependent characteristics of the network parameters and choosing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, some sufficient conditions are established under which the underlying DSMNN is globally exponentially stable in the mean square.	Semantic Scholar
The derived conditions are made dependent on both the leakage and the probabilistic delays, and are therefore less conservative than the traditional delay-independent criteria.	Semantic Scholar
A simulation example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed stability criterion.	Semantic Scholar
Paramagnetic nanoparticles are considered as attractive building blocks, particularly for robotic delivery of drugs.	Semantic Scholar
Although paramagnetic nanoparticles can be effectively gathered and transported using external magnetic fields, the disassembly process is yet to be fully investigated to avoid the formation of aggregations.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we report a novel method of controllable disassembly of paramagnetic nanoparticle chains using a predefined dynamic magnetic field.	Semantic Scholar
The dynamic field is capable of performing spreading and fragmentation of the particle chains simultaneously.	Semantic Scholar
Using the magnetic dipole–dipole repulsive forces, the final area covered by the particle chains swells up to 545% of the initial area.	Semantic Scholar
The final length distribution presents a strong relationship with the frequency of the dynamic field in deionized (DI) water and two kinds of biofluids.	Semantic Scholar
An analytical model of phase lag is proposed, which shows good agreement with the experimental results.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we also present an assembly process using a rotating magnetic field, indicating that the assembly disassembly process is reversible.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, batch-cargo delivery of polystyrene microbeads using the nanoparticle chains as swarm-like nanorobots is demonstrated.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present the design of a miniature (100 mm) autonomous underwater robot that is low-cost ($ 100), easy to manufacture, and highly maneuverable.	Semantic Scholar
A key aspect of the robot design that makes this possible is the use of low-cost magnet-in-coil actuators, which have a small profile and minimal sealing requirements.	Semantic Scholar
This allows us to create a robot with multiple flapping fin propulsors that independently control robot motions in surge, heave, and yaw.	Semantic Scholar
We present several results on the robot, including 1) quantified open-loop swimming characteristics; 2) autonomous behaviors using a pressure sensor and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to achieve controlled swimming of prescribed trajectories; 3) feedback from an optic sensor to enable homing to a light source.	Semantic Scholar
The robot is designed to form the basis for underwater swarm robotics testbeds, where low cost and ease of manufacture are critical, and three-dimensional (3-D) maneuverability allows testing complex coordination inspired by natural fish schools.	Semantic Scholar
Individually, miniature and low-cost underwater robots can also provide a platform for the study of 3-D autonomy and marine vehicle dynamics in educational and resource-constrained settings.	Semantic Scholar
Wearable robotic hand rehabilitation devices can allow greater freedom and flexibility than their workstation-like counterparts.	Semantic Scholar
However, the field is generally lacking effective methods by which the user can operate the device: such controls must be effective, intuitive, and robust to the wide range of possible impairment patterns.	Semantic Scholar
Even when focusing on a specific condition, such as stroke, the variety of encountered upper limb impairment patterns means that a single sensing modality, such as electromyography (EMG), might not be sufficient to enable controls for a broad range of users.	Semantic Scholar
To address this significant gap, we introduce a multimodal sensing and interaction paradigm for an active hand orthosis.	Semantic Scholar
In our proof-of-concept implementation, EMG is complemented by other sensing modalities, such as finger bend and contact pressure sensors.	Semantic Scholar
We propose multimodal interaction methods that utilize this sensory data as input and show they can enable tasks for stroke survivors who exhibit different impairment patterns.	Semantic Scholar
We believe that robotic hand orthoses developed as multimodal sensory platforms with help address some of the key challenges in physical interaction with the user.	Semantic Scholar
Despite the proliferation of topic models, the organization of topics from the probabilistic models needs improvement in two ways: the better structured presentation of topics and the incorporation of domain knowledge on the corpus.	Semantic Scholar
The structured presentation, i.e., the hierarchical topic model, helps in categorizing similar topics; the incorporation of domain knowledge enables the concentrated sampling of predefined keywords in the mixture parameter learning.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a hierarchical topic models with incorporated domain knowledge, called Guided Hierarchical Topic Model (GHTM).	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we allocated the prior information from the knowledge to the Dirichlet Forest prior.	Semantic Scholar
From the prior adjustment, we obtained the topic tree guided by the domain knowledge.	Semantic Scholar
This paper also contributes in enumerating four different knowledge extraction methods and applying the extracted knowledge to GHTM.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluated the performance of GHTM in terms of the hierarchical clustering accuracy, and we found a significant improvement of hierarchical clustering measured by F-measures.	Semantic Scholar
This improvement is also verified by the perplexity analyses.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, we measured topic quality with KL-divergence and visualization, and these confirm the ability to better separate topic distributions.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we tested the hierarchical topic quality through human experiments, and this also revealed significant improvements originating from the guidance.	Semantic Scholar
Trajectory optimization is an essential tool for motion planning under multiple constraints of robotic manipulators.	Semantic Scholar
Optimization-based methods can explicitly optimize a trajectory by leveraging prior knowledge of the system and have been used in various applications such as collision avoidance.	Semantic Scholar
However, these methods often require a hand-coded cost function in order to achieve the desired behavior.	Semantic Scholar
Specifying such cost function for a complex desired behavior, e.g., disentangling a rope, is a nontrivial task that is often even infeasible.	Semantic Scholar
Learning from demonstration (LfD) methods offer an alternative way to program robot motion.	Semantic Scholar
LfD methods are less dependent on analytical models and instead learn the behavior of experts implicitly from the demonstrated trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
However, the problem of adapting the demonstrations to new situations, e.g., avoiding newly introduced obstacles, has not been fully investigated in the literature.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a motion planning framework that combines the advantages of optimization-based and demonstration-based methods.	Semantic Scholar
We learn a distribution of trajectories demonstrated by human experts and use it to guide the trajectory optimization process.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting trajectory maintains the demonstrated behaviors, which are essential to performing the task successfully, while adapting the trajectory to avoid obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
In simulated experiments and with a real robotic system, we verify that our approach optimizes the trajectory to avoid obstacles and encodes the demonstrated behavior in the resulting trajectory.	Semantic Scholar
Existing multi-view clustering algorithms require that the data is completely or partially mapped between each pair of views.	Semantic Scholar
However, this requirement could not be satisfied in many practical settings.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we tackle the problem of multi-view clustering on unmapped data in the framework of NMF based clustering.	Semantic Scholar
With the help of inter-view constraints, we define the disagreement between each pair of views by the fact that the indicator vectors of two samples from two different views should be similar if they belong to the same cluster and dissimilar otherwise.	Semantic Scholar
The overall objective of our algorithm is to minimize the loss function of NMF in each view as well as the disagreement between each pair of views.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we provide an active inter-view constraints selection strategy which tries to query the relationships between samples that are the most influential and samples that are the farthest from the existing constraint set.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that, with a small number of (either randomly selected or actively selected) constraints, the proposed algorithm performs well on unmapped data, and outperforms the baseline algorithms on partially mapped data and completely mapped data.	Semantic Scholar
For autonomous quadrotors to be used for applications such as delivery, disaster response, and inspection, there is a need to fly near obstacles, especially in urban and indoor environments.	Semantic Scholar
Often, it is also beneficial to fly at high speeds to complete tasks quickly.	Semantic Scholar
A key challenge in enabling these capabilities is to plan trajectories, in a limited time period, that are safe, collision-free, and dynamically feasible.	Semantic Scholar
In this context, dynamic feasibility means that the trajectory can be accurately tracked in flight: a critical requirement when flying near to obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
When evaluating trajectory planning algorithms, it is important to understand their strengths and weaknesses; in this paper, we compare three state-of-the-art algorithms with a set of real-world planning scenarios and assessments of performance when planned trajectories are tracked in flight.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce a combination of the work of Campos-Macias et al.	Semantic Scholar
with Bry et al., which is shown to perform well for slow and conservative trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm from Bry et al.	Semantic Scholar
is shown to perform the best for higher speed trajectories with relatively large amounts of open space.	Semantic Scholar
An adaptation of the algorithm from the work of Chamitoff et al.	Semantic Scholar
for quadrotor applications, as presented here, is shown to be the best planner for high-speed trajectories in tight confines, while relaxing the need for initial seed-paths that are collision free.	Semantic Scholar
We propose the use of the convex optimization-based EDA (cvxEDA) framework to automatically characterize the force and velocity of caressing stimuli through the analysis of the electrodermal activity (EDA).	Semantic Scholar
CvxEDA, in fact, solves a convex optimization problem that always guarantees the globally optimal solution.	Semantic Scholar
We show that this approach is especially suitable for the implementation in wearable monitoring systems, being more computationally efficient than a widely used EDA processing algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, it ensures low-memory consumption, due to a sparse representation of the EDA phasic components.	Semantic Scholar
EDA recordings were gathered from 32 healthy subjects (16 females) who participated in an experiment where a fabric-based wearable haptic system conveyed them caress-like stimuli by means of two motors.	Semantic Scholar
Six types of stimuli (combining three levels of velocity and two of force) were randomly administered over time.	Semantic Scholar
Performance was evaluated in terms of execution time of the algorithm, memory usage, and statistical significance in discerning the affective stimuli along force and velocity dimensions.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results revealed good performance of cvxEDA model for all of the considered metrics.	Semantic Scholar
A smart wheelchair (SW) is a power wheelchair (PW) to which computers, sensors, and assistive technology are attached.	Semantic Scholar
In the past decade, there has been little effort to provide a systematic review of SW research.	Semantic Scholar
This paper aims to provide a complete state-of-the-art overview of SW research trends.	Semantic Scholar
We expect that the information gathered in this study will enhance awareness of the status of contemporary PW as well as SW technology and increase the functional mobility of people who use PWs.	Semantic Scholar
We systematically present the international SW research effort, starting with an introduction to PWs and the communities they serve.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we discuss in detail the SW and associated technological innovations with an emphasis on the most researched areas, generating the most interest for future research and development.	Semantic Scholar
We conclude with our vision for the future of SW research and how to best serve people with all types of disabilities.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we aim to obtain a dense piecewise planar reconstruction of the scene from multiple image frames based on a factorization framework.	Semantic Scholar
Integrating all the relevant constraints in a global objective function, we are able to effectively leverage on the scene smoothness prior afforded by the dense formulation, as well as imposing the necessary algebraic constraints required by the shape matrix.	Semantic Scholar
These constraints also help to robustly decompose the measurement matrix into the underlying low-rank subspace and the sparse outlier part.	Semantic Scholar
Numerically, we achieve the constrained factorization and decomposition via modifying a recently proposed proximal alternating robust subspace minimization algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that our algorithm is effective in handling real life sequences, and outperforms other algorithms in recovering motions and dense scene estimate.	Semantic Scholar
In the field of pattern recognition, data analysis, and machine learning, data points are usually modeled as high-dimensional vectors.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the curse-of-dimensionality, it is non-trivial to efficiently process the orginal data directly.	Semantic Scholar
Given the unique properties of nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques, nonlinear learning methods are widely adopted to reduce the dimension of data.	Semantic Scholar
However, existing nonlinear learning methods fail in many real applications because of the too-strict requirements (for real data) or the difficulty in parameters tuning.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the manifold learning methods which belong to the family of nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we proposed a new manifold learning principle for dimensionality reduction named Curved Cosine Mapping (CCM).	Semantic Scholar
Based on the law of cosines in Euclidean space, CCM applies a brand new mapping pattern to manifold learning.	Semantic Scholar
In CCM, the nonlinear geometric relationships are obtained by utlizing the law of cosines, and then quantified as the dimensionality-reduced features.	Semantic Scholar
Compared with the existing approaches, the model has weaker theoretical assumptions over the input data.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, to further reduce the computation cost, an optimized version of CCM is developed.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we conduct extensive experiments over both artificial and real-world datasets to demonstrate the performance of proposed techniques.	Semantic Scholar
This letter reports the development of a vision-based calibration method for dual remote center-of-motion (RCM) based robot arms in a human-robot collaborative minimally invasive surgery (MIS) scenario.	Semantic Scholar
The method does not require any external tracking sensors and directly uses images captured by the endoscopic camera and the robot encoder readings as calibration data, which leads to a minimal and practical system in the operating room.	Semantic Scholar
By taking advantage of the motion constraints imposed by the RCM-based kinematics of the robotic surgical tools and cameras, we can find unique relationships between the endoscope and the surgical tool using camera perspective projection geometry without the geometric information of the tool.	Semantic Scholar
A customized vision-based centerline detection algorithm is also proposed, which provides robust estimation of centerline positions for a variety of settings.	Semantic Scholar
We validate the method through simulations and an experimental study in a simulated MIS scenario, in which the first generation da Vinci surgical system controlled by the open source da Vinci research kit electronics and cisst/SAW software environment is used.	Semantic Scholar
The robust control synthesis of continuous-time nonlinear systems with uncertain term is investigated via event-triggering mechanism and adaptive critic learning technique.	Semantic Scholar
We mainly focus on combining the event-triggering mechanism with adaptive critic designs, so as to solve the nonlinear robust control problem.	Semantic Scholar
This can not only make better use of computation and communication resources, but also conduct controller design from the view of intelligent optimization.	Semantic Scholar
Through theoretical analysis, the nonlinear robust stabilization can be achieved by obtaining an event-triggered optimal control law of the nominal system with a newly defined cost function and a certain triggering condition.	Semantic Scholar
The adaptive critic technique is employed to facilitate the event-triggered control design, where a neural network is introduced as an approximator of the learning phase.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of the event-triggered robust control scheme is validated via simulation studies and comparisons.	Semantic Scholar
The present method extends the application domain of both event-triggered control and adaptive critic control to nonlinear systems possessing dynamical uncertainties.	Semantic Scholar
Crossing surface discontinuities, such as ditches or curbs in urban environments, is a relevant navigation issue for ground mobile robots.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a maneuver for negotiating surface discontinuities for a hybrid locomotion system consisting on a skid-steer wheeled vehicle with a single caster-leg mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
This maneuver is appropriate for gaps, steps, and ramps, both upwards and downwards.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, an analysis of tipover stability and steerability through the different states of the maneuver is performed, resulting in sensor-based stability margins that can be computed online.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results have been obtained by means of realistic Simulink/ADAMS simulations and actual tests with the Lazaro mobile robot.	Semantic Scholar
The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed maneuver as well as the applicability of stability margins.	Semantic Scholar
Direct methods for visual odometry (VO) have gained popularity for their capability to exploit information from all intensity gradients in the image.	Semantic Scholar
However, low computational speed as well as missing guarantees for optimality and consistency are limiting factors of direct methods, in which established feature-based methods succeed instead.	Semantic Scholar
Based on these considerations, we propose a semidirect VO (SVO) that uses direct methods to track and triangulate pixels that are characterized by high image gradients, but relies on proven feature-based methods for joint optimization of structure and motion.	Semantic Scholar
Together with a robust probabilistic depth estimation algorithm, this enables us to efficiently track pixels lying on weak corners and edges in environments with little or high-frequency texture.	Semantic Scholar
We further demonstrate that the algorithm can easily be extended to multiple cameras, to track edges, to include motion priors, and to enable the use of very large field of view cameras, such as fisheye and catadioptric ones.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets shows that the algorithm is significantly faster than the state of the art while achieving highly competitive accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
Ankle inversion–eversion compliance is an important feature of conventional prosthetic feet, and control of inversion, or roll, in active prostheses could improve balance for people with amputation.	Semantic Scholar
We designed a tethered ankle–foot prosthesis with two independently actuated toes that are coordinated to provide plantar-flexion and inversion–eversion torques.	Semantic Scholar
A Bowden cable tether provides series elasticity.	Semantic Scholar
The prosthesis is simple and lightweight, with a mass of 0.72 kg.	Semantic Scholar
Strain gauges on the toes measure torque with less than 1% root mean squared (RMS) error.	Semantic Scholar

These properties make the platform suitable for testing inversion-related prosthesis features and controllers in experiments with humans.	Semantic Scholar
This paper addresses a synchronization problem that arises when a team of robots needs to communicate while repeatedly performing assigned tasks in a cooperative scenario.	Semantic Scholar
Each robot has a limited communication range and moves along a previously defined closed trajectory.	Semantic Scholar
When two robots are close enough, a communication link may be established, allowing the robots to exchange information.	Semantic Scholar
The goal is to schedule the motions such that the entire system can be synchronized for maximum information exchange; that is, every pair of neighbors always visit the feasible communication link at the same time.	Semantic Scholar
An algorithm for scheduling the team of robots in this scenario is proposed and a robust framework that assures the synchronization of a large team of robots is presented.	Semantic Scholar
Simulations, experiments, and computational results demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The approach allows the design of fault-tolerant systems that can be used for multiple tasks, such as surveillance, area exploration, and searching for targets in hazardous environments, among others.	Semantic Scholar
Localization is an integral part of reliable robot navigation, and long-term autonomy requires robustness against perceptional changes in the environment during localization.	Semantic Scholar
In the context of vision-based localization, such changes can be caused by illumination variations, occlusion, structural development, different weather conditions, and seasons.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a novel approach for localizing a robot over longer periods of time using only monocular image data.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel data association approach for matching streams of incoming images to an image sequence stored in a database.	Semantic Scholar
Our method exploits network flows to leverage sequential information to improve the localization performance and to maintain several possible trajectories hypotheses in parallel.	Semantic Scholar
To compare images, we consider a semidense image description based on histogram of oriented gradients features as well as global descriptors from deep convolutional neural networks trained on ImageNet for robust localization.	Semantic Scholar
We perform extensive evaluations on a variety of datasets and show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.	Semantic Scholar
Robotics has the potential to become a revolutionary technology in the next future and if we want to spread it among the population we must start accounting for affordability in robot research and design.	Semantic Scholar
Plastic robots are an emerging example of affordable design where expensive metal structures are replaced by low-cost plastic materials.	Semantic Scholar
Plastic materials are not only cost effective but, thanks to their inherent compliance and lightweight, lead to significant advantages in terms of safety and force controllability.	Semantic Scholar
Inspired by the idea of series elastic actuator (SEA) this letter introduces the new concept of series elastic link (SEL), which exploits the inherent flexibility of plastic links to implement series compliance.	Semantic Scholar
This letter elaborates on the concept of SEL and highlights a parallelism with SEAs.	Semantic Scholar
Then, focusing on a single-DOF setup it shows that, beyond their economic advantage, SELs lead to enhanced safety and more accurate force control with respect to traditional SEA implementations.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed argumentations are theoretically supported and experimentally validated.	Semantic Scholar

This paper studies a family of optimization problems where a set of items, each requiring a possibly different amount of resource, must be assigned to different slots for which the price of the resource can vary.	Semantic Scholar
The objective is then to assign items such that the overall resource cost is minimized.	Semantic Scholar
Such problems arise commonly in domains such as production scheduling in the presence of fluctuating renewable energy costs or variants of the Travelling Salesman Problem.	Semantic Scholar
In Constraint Programming, this can be naturally modeled in two ways: (a) with a sum of element constraints; (b) with a MinimumAssignment constraint.	Semantic Scholar
Unfortunately the sum of element constraints obtains a weak filtering and the MinimumAssignment constraint does not scale well on large instances.	Semantic Scholar
This work proposes a third approach by introducing the ResourceCostAllDifferent constraint and an associated incremental and scalable filtering algorithm, running in O ( n ⋅ m ) $\mathcal {O}(n \cdot m)$ , where n is the number of unbound variables and m is the maximum domain size of unbound variables.	Semantic Scholar
Its goal is to compute the total cost in a scalable manner by dealing with the fact that all assignments must be different.	Semantic Scholar
We first evaluate the efficiency of the new filtering on a real industrial problem and then on the Product Matrix Travelling Salesman Problem, a special case of the Asymmetric Travelling Salesman Problem.	Semantic Scholar
The study shows experimentally that our approach generally outperforms the decomposition and the MinimumAssignment ones for the problems we considered.	Semantic Scholar
While only continuous motions are possible, the way in which contacts appear and disappear confers to legged locomotion a characteristic discontinuous nature that is traditionally shared by the algorithms used for legged locomotion planning.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we show that this discontinuous nature can disappear if the notion of collision is well redefined and we efficiently solve two different practical problems of legged locomotion planning with algorithms based on an approach that establishes a bridge between discrete and continuous planning.

The first problem consists of reactive footstep planning with a biped robot and the second one consists of nongaited locomotion planning with a hexapod.	Semantic Scholar
Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) for Versatile Applications (SNAVA) simulation platform is a scalable and programmable parallel architecture that supports real-time, large-scale, multi-model SNN computation.	Semantic Scholar
This parallel architecture is implemented in modern Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) devices to provide high performance execution and flexibility to support large-scale SNN models.	Semantic Scholar
Flexibility is defined in terms of programmability, which allows easy synapse and neuron implementation.	Semantic Scholar
This has been achieved by using a special-purpose Processing Elements (PEs) for computing SNNs, and analyzing and customizing the instruction set according to the processing needs to achieve maximum performance with minimum resources.	Semantic Scholar
The parallel architecture is interfaced with customized Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to configure the SNN's connectivity, to compile the neuron-synapse model and to monitor SNN's activity.	Semantic Scholar
Our contribution intends to provide a tool that allows to prototype SNNs faster than on CPU/GPU architectures but significantly cheaper than fabricating a customized neuromorphic chip.	Semantic Scholar
This could be potentially valuable to the computational neuroscience and neuromorphic engineering communities.	Semantic Scholar
Accurate tumor segmentation from PET images is crucial in many radiation oncology applications.	Semantic Scholar
Among others, partial volume effect (PVE) is recognized as one of the most important factors degrading imaging quality and segmentation accuracy in PET.	Semantic Scholar
Taking into account that image restoration and tumor segmentation are tightly coupled and can promote each other, we proposed a variational method to solve both problems simultaneously in this study.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method integrated total variation (TV) semi-blind de-convolution and Mumford-Shah segmentation with multiple regularizations.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike many existing energy minimization methods using either TV or L2 regularization, the proposed method employed TV regularization over tumor edges to preserve edge information, and L2 regularization inside tumor regions to preserve the smooth change of the metabolic uptake in a PET image.	Semantic Scholar
The blur kernel was modeled as anisotropic Gaussian to address the resolution difference in transverse and axial directions commonly seen in a clinic PET scanner.	Semantic Scholar
The energy functional was rephrased using the Γ-convergence approximation and was iteratively optimized using the alternating minimization (AM) algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of the proposed method was validated on a physical phantom and two clinic datasets with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and esophageal cancer, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method had high performance for simultaneous image restoration, tumor segmentation and scanner blur kernel estimation.	Semantic Scholar
Particularly, the recovery coefficients (RC) of the restored images of the proposed method in the phantom study were close to 1, indicating an efficient recovery of the original blurred images; for segmentation the proposed method achieved average dice similarity indexes (DSIs) of 0.79 and 0.80 for two clinic datasets, respectively; and the relative errors of the estimated blur kernel widths were less than 19% in the transversal direction and 7% in the axial direction.

Fractional calculus has been found to be a promising area of research for information processing and modeling of some physical systems.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a fractional gradient descent method for the backpropagation (BP) training of neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the Caputo derivative is employed to evaluate the fractional-order gradient of the error defined as the traditional quadratic energy function.	Semantic Scholar
The monotonicity and weak (strong) convergence of the proposed approach are proved in detail.	Semantic Scholar
Two simulations have been implemented to illustrate the performance of presented fractional-order BP algorithm on three small datasets and one large dataset.	Semantic Scholar
The numerical simulations effectively verify the theoretical observations of this paper as well.	Semantic Scholar
Understanding the environment is a key requirement for any autonomous robot operation.	Semantic Scholar

Airflow pattern information allow to plan energy efficient paths for flying robots and improve gas distribution mapping.	Semantic Scholar
However, modeling the motion of objects (e.g., people) and flow of continuous media (e.g., air) is a challenging task.	Semantic Scholar
We present a probabilistic approach for general flow mapping, which can readily handle both of these examples.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we present and compare two data imputation methods allowing to build dense maps from sparsely distributed measurements.	Semantic Scholar
The methods are evaluated using two different data sets: one with pedestrian data and one with wind measurements.	Semantic Scholar
Our results show that it is possible to accurately represent multimodal, turbulent flow using a set of Gaussian Mixture Models, and also to reconstruct a dense representation based on sparsely distributed locations.	Semantic Scholar

Underwater sensing using electric field has been traditionally modeled by the computationally heavy finite element method (FEM) or boundary element method.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, techniques in light scattering problems were for the first time expanded to underwater active electrosense.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical solutions of the volume integral equation were formulated, including a method of moment and discrete dipole approximation (DDA).	Semantic Scholar
We found that only DDA was suitable for conductive mediums and the connection between DDA, and a well-known sphere perturbation formula was further established.	Semantic Scholar
DDA was found to perform more than 100 times faster than FEM with only a 10% relative difference in underwater electrosense problems.	Semantic Scholar
A DDA-based unscented Kalman filter was proposed for inferring object size and location, and a one-dimensional sensor was made for further experimental validation.	Semantic Scholar

Optimal control theory and machine learning techniques are combined to formulate and solve in closed form an optimal control formulation of online learning from supervised examples with regularization of the updates.	Semantic Scholar
The connections with the classical linear quadratic gaussian (LQG) optimal control problem, of which the proposed learning paradigm is a nontrivial variation as it involves random matrices, are investigated.	Semantic Scholar
The obtained optimal solutions are compared with the Kalman filter estimate of the parameter vector to be learned.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown that the proposed algorithm is less sensitive to outliers with respect to the Kalman estimate (thanks to the presence of the regularization term), thus providing smoother estimates with respect to time.	Semantic Scholar
The basic formulation of the proposed online learning framework refers to a discrete-time setting with a finite learning horizon and a linear model.	Semantic Scholar
Various extensions are investigated, including the infinite learning horizon and, via the so-called kernel trick, the case of nonlinear models.	Semantic Scholar
Nonprehensile manipulation is necessary for robots to operate in humans’ daily lives.	Semantic Scholar
As nonprehensile manipulation should satisfy both kinematics and dynamics requirements simultaneously, it is difficult to manipulate objects along given paths.	Semantic Scholar
Previous studies have considered the problems with sequence-to-sequence models, which are neural networks for time-series conversion.	Semantic Scholar
However, they did not consider nonlinear contact models, such as friction models.	Semantic Scholar
When we train the seq2seq models using end-to-end backpropagation, training losses vanish owing to static friction.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we realize sequence-to-sequence models for trajectory planning of nonprehensile manipulation including contact models between the robots and target objects.	Semantic Scholar
This letter proposes a training curriculum that commences training without contact models to bring the seq2seq models outside of the gradient-vanishing zone.	Semantic Scholar
This letter discusses sliding manipulation, which includes a friction model between objects and tools, such as frying pans fixed onto the robots.	Semantic Scholar
We validated the proposed curriculum through a simulation.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we observed that the trained seq2seq models could handle parameter fluctuations that did not exist during training.	Semantic Scholar

A novel region-based approach is proposed to find a thin plate spline map between a pair of deformable 3D objects represented by triangular surface meshes.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method works without landmark extraction and feature correspondences.	Semantic Scholar
The aligning transformation is simply found by solving a system of integral equations.	Semantic Scholar
Each equation is generated by integrating a non-linear function over the object domains.	Semantic Scholar
We derive recursive formulas for the efficient computation of these integrals for open and closed surface meshes.	Semantic Scholar
Based on a series of comparative tests on a large synthetic dataset, our triangular mesh-based algorithm outperforms state of the art methods both in terms of computing time and accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
The applicability of the proposed approach has been demonstrated on the registration of 3D lung CT volumes, brain surfaces and 3D human faces.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we show that visual servoing can be formulated as an acceleration-resolved, quadratic optimization problem.	Semantic Scholar
This allows us to handle visual constraints, such as field of view and occlusion avoidance, as inequalities.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, it allows us to easily integrate visual servoing tasks into existing whole-body control frameworks for humanoid robots, which simplifies prioritization and requires only a posture task as a regularization term.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we show this method working on simulations with HRP-4 and real tests on Romeo.	Semantic Scholar
In order to control more efficiently the feet-ground interaction of humanoid robots during walking, we investigate adding outer soft (i.e.	Semantic Scholar
compliant) soles to the feet.	Semantic Scholar
The deformation subsequent to the contact of the soles with the ground is taken into account using a new walking pattern generator and deformation estimator.	Semantic Scholar
This novel humanoid walking approach ensures that the desired zero moment point for stability requirement is fulfilled.	Semantic Scholar
We validate our new controller using the HRP-4 humanoid robot performing walking experiments with and without the estimator.	Semantic Scholar
Also, to test the robustness of our approach and to obtain low-energy walking, we performed different walking motions.	Semantic Scholar
Haptic rendering denotes the process of computing and displaying forces from a virtual environment to a human operator via a haptic device.	Semantic Scholar
From the control point of view, the complete haptic system comprising virtual environment, haptic device, and human operator is a hybrid control system that contains both discrete- and continuous-time elements.	Semantic Scholar
This letter investigates the influence of time delay on the theoretical optimal performance during haptic rendering with regard to minimal settling time, which belongs to the most frequently used design criteria in control engineering.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown that both continuous-time stiffness and damping of human operator or haptic device improve the optimal performance of the device.	Semantic Scholar
For the worst case, i.e., without such physical elements, the influence of delay on the optimal settling time becomes almost linear.	Semantic Scholar
This observation leads to an easy-to-remember rule of thumb for the optimal settling time that a haptic device should theoretically be able to reach.	Semantic Scholar
It states that each sampling period of additional time delay causes the optimal settling time (for a $2\%$ position threshold) to increase by approximately five sampling periods.	Semantic Scholar
In this linear relation, the effect of discrete-time sampling appears to correspond to a delay of one whole sampling period.	Semantic Scholar
The theoretical investigations are accompanied by a series of experiments on a DLR/KUKA light-weight robot, which shows that the newly introduced rule of thumb also applies for single joints of complex robotic systems.	Semantic Scholar
Fine needle deflection is a problem encountered during insertion into a soft tissue.	Semantic Scholar
Although an axial rotational insertion is an effective approach for minimizing this problem, needle deflection still depends on the insertion angle with respect to the tissue boundary.	Semantic Scholar
Since the human body consists of multilayered tissues of various shapes and mechanical properties, preoperative planning of an optimal path is a key factor for achieving a successful insertion.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose an optimization-based preoperative path planning model that minimizes needle deflection during multilayered tissue insertion.	Semantic Scholar
This model can determine the optimal path based on the sum of insertion angles with respect to each tissue boundary that the needle passes through.	Semantic Scholar
To increase the accuracy of the model, we incorporated the effect of distances from tissue boundaries and the probability that the deflection is acceptable by incorporating weighting factors into the model.	Semantic Scholar
To validate the model, we performed experiments involving four scenarios of two- and three-layered tissues.	Semantic Scholar
The results showed that the proposed model is capable of determining the optimal insertion path in all scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce a novel data-driven approach for face inpainting, which makes use of the observable region of an occluded face as well as its inferred high-level facial attributes, namely gender, ethnicity, and expression.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the intuition that the realism of a face inpainting result depends significantly on its overall consistency with respect to these high-level attributes, our approach selects a guidance face that matches the targeted attributes and utilizes it together with the observable input face regions to inpaint the missing areas.	Semantic Scholar
These two sources of information are balanced using an adaptive optimization, and the inpainting is performed on the intrinsic image layers instead of the RGB color space to handle the illumination differences between the target face and the guidance face to further enhance the resulting visual quality.	Semantic Scholar
Our experiments demonstrate that this approach is effective in inpainting facial components such as the mouth or the eyes that could be partially or completely occluded in the input face.	Semantic Scholar
A perceptual study shows that our approach generates more natural facial appearances by accounting for high-level facial attributes.	Semantic Scholar

Networks are prevalent in many high impact domains.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, cross-domain interactions are frequently observed in many applications, which naturally form the dependencies between different networks.	Semantic Scholar
Such kind of highly coupled network systems are referred to as multi-layered networks, and have been used to characterize various complex systems, including critical infrastructure networks, cyber-physical systems, collaboration platforms, biological systems, and many more.	Semantic Scholar
Different from single-layered networks where the functionality of their nodes is mainly affected by within-layer connections, multi-layered networks are more vulnerable to disturbance as the impact can be amplified through cross-layer dependencies, leading to the cascade failure to the entire system.

To manipulate the connectivity in multi-layered networks, some recent methods have been proposed based on two-layered networks with specific types of connectivity measures.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we address the above challenges in multiple dimensions.	Semantic Scholar
First, we propose a family of connectivity measures (SubLine) that unifies a wide range of classic network connectivity measures.	Semantic Scholar
Third, we reveal that the connectivity measures in the  SubLine family enjoy diminishing returns property, which guarantees a near-optimal solution with linear complexity for the connectivity optimization problem.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we evaluate our proposed algorithm on real data sets to demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
Recurrent neural network architectures can have useful computational properties, with complex temporal dynamics and input-sensitive attractor states.	Semantic Scholar
However, evaluation of recurrent dynamic architectures requires solving systems of differential equations, and the number of evaluations required to determine their response to a given input can vary with the input or can be indeterminate altogether in the case of oscillations or instability.	Semantic Scholar
In feedforward networks, by contrast, only a single pass through the network is needed to determine the response to a given input.	Semantic Scholar
Modern machine learning systems are designed to operate efficiently on feedforward architectures.	Semantic Scholar
We hypothesized that two-layer feedforward architectures with simple, deterministic dynamics could approximate the responses of single-layer recurrent network architectures.	Semantic Scholar
By identifying the fixed-point responses of a given recurrent network, we trained two-layer networks to directly approximate the fixed-point response to a given input.	Semantic Scholar
These feedforward networks then embodied useful computations, including competitive interactions, information transformations, and noise rejection.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach was able to find useful approximations to recurrent networks, which can then be evaluated in linear and deterministic time complexity.	Semantic Scholar
Location recommendation plays an essential role in helping people find attractive places.	Semantic Scholar
Though recent research has studied how to recommend locations with social and geographical information, few of them addressed the cold-start problem of new users.	Semantic Scholar
Because mobility records are often shared on social networks, semantic information can be leveraged to tackle this challenge.	Semantic Scholar
A typical method is to feed them into explicit-feedback-based content-aware collaborative filtering, but they require drawing negative samples for better learning performance, as users’ negative preference is not observable in human mobility.	Semantic Scholar
However, prior studies have empirically shown sampling-based methods do not perform well.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we propose a scalable Implicit-feedback-based Content-aware Collaborative Filtering (ICCF) framework to incorporate semantic content and to steer clear of negative sampling.	Semantic Scholar
We then develop an efficient optimization algorithm, scaling linearly with data size and feature size, and quadratically with the dimension of latent space.	Semantic Scholar
We further establish its relationship with graph Laplacian regularized matrix factorization.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we evaluate ICCF with a large-scale LBSN dataset in which users have profiles and textual content.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that ICCF outperforms several competing baselines, and that user information is not only effective for improving recommendations but also coping with cold-start scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, the method of choice to exploit robot dynamics for efficient walking is numerical optimization (NO).	Semantic Scholar
The main drawback in NO is the computational complexity, which strongly affects the time demand of the solution.	Semantic Scholar
Several strategies can be used to make the optimization more treatable and to efficiently describe the solution set.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present an algorithm to encode effective walking references, generated offline via numerical optimization, extracting a limited number of principal components and using them as a basis of optimal motions.	Semantic Scholar
By combining these components, a good approximation of the optimal gaits can be generated at run time.	Semantic Scholar
The advantages of the presented approach are discussed, and an extensive experimental validation is carried out on a planar legged robot with elastic joints.	Semantic Scholar
The biped thus controlled is able to start and stop walking on a treadmill, and to control its speed dynamically as the treadmill speed changes.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a trust and self-confidence-based autonomy allocation strategy to automatically choose between manual and autonomous control of (semi)autonomous mobile robots in guidance and navigation tasks.	Semantic Scholar
We utilize a performance-centric, computational trust and self-confidence model and automated autonomy allocation strategy, developed in our earlier work (H. Saeidi and Y. Wang, “Trust and self-confidence based autonomy allocation for robotic systems,” in Proc.	Semantic Scholar

), based on objective and unbiased performance measures for the human and the robot.	Semantic Scholar
A set of robot simulations with a human-in-the-loop is conducted for a teleoperated unmanned aerial vehicle tracking task.	Semantic Scholar
The results demonstrate that our allocation strategy can capture human autonomy allocation pattern with an accuracy of 64.05%.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that the strategy can improve the overall robot performance by 11.76% and reduce operator's workload by 10.07% compared to a manual allocation.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, compared to a performance maximization strategy, our strategy is 23.42% more likely to be accepted and generally preferred and trusted by the participants.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we design a decision pattern correction algorithm based on nonlinear model predictive control to help a human operator gradually adapt to a modified allocation pattern for improved overall performance.	Semantic Scholar
Understanding 3D object structure from a single image is an important but challenging task in computer vision, mostly due to the lack of 3D object annotations to real images.	Semantic Scholar
Previous research tackled this problem by either searching for a 3D shape that best explains 2D annotations, or training purely on synthetic data with ground truth 3D information.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we propose 3D INterpreter Networks (3D-INN), an end-to-end trainable framework that sequentially estimates 2D keypoint heatmaps and 3D object skeletons and poses.	Semantic Scholar
Our system learns from both 2D-annotated real images and synthetic 3D data.	Semantic Scholar
This is made possible mainly by two technical innovations.	Semantic Scholar
First, heatmaps of 2D keypoints serve as an intermediate representation to connect real and synthetic data.	Semantic Scholar
3D-INN is trained on real images to estimate 2D keypoint heatmaps from an input image; it then predicts 3D object structure from heatmaps using knowledge learned from synthetic 3D shapes.	Semantic Scholar
By doing so, 3D-INN benefits from the variation and abundance of synthetic 3D objects, without suffering from the domain difference between real and synthesized images, often due to imperfect rendering.	Semantic Scholar
Second, we propose a Projection Layer, mapping estimated 3D structure back to 2D.	Semantic Scholar
During training, it ensures 3D-INN to predict 3D structure whose projection is consistent with the 2D annotations to real images.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments show that the proposed system performs well on both 2D keypoint estimation and 3D structure recovery.	Semantic Scholar
We also demonstrate that the recovered 3D information has wide vision applications, such as image retrieval.	Semantic Scholar
Intruder tracking and herding problems are crucial in several applications.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, a game theoretic coordination protocol for multimobile robot systems is proposed to tackle both problems simultaneously.	Semantic Scholar
Defender robots move according to computed Nash equilibria to herd the intruder into a safe area while preventing its access to one or more protected areas.	Semantic Scholar
The concept of a virtual barrier is presented to induce defenders to automatically and uniformly deploy along the barrier in order to drive intruder away from the protected areas and toward the safe one.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation results are reported to validate the proposed approach.	Semantic Scholar
One camera and one low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU) form a monocular visual-inertial system (VINS), which is the minimum sensor suite (in size, weight, and power) for the metric six degrees-of-freedom (DOF) state estimation.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present VINS-Mono: a robust and versatile monocular visual-inertial state estimator.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach starts with a robust procedure for estimator initialization.	Semantic Scholar
A tightly coupled, nonlinear optimization-based method is used to obtain highly accurate visual-inertial odometry by fusing preintegrated IMU measurements and feature observations.	Semantic Scholar
A loop detection module, in combination with our tightly coupled formulation, enables relocalization with minimum computation.	Semantic Scholar
We additionally perform 4-DOF pose graph optimization to enforce the global consistency.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the proposed system can reuse a map by saving and loading it in an efficient way.	Semantic Scholar
The current and previous maps can be merged together by the global pose graph optimization.	Semantic Scholar
We validate the performance of our system on public datasets and real-world experiments and compare against other state-of-the-art algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
We also perform an onboard closed-loop autonomous flight on the microaerial-vehicle platform and port the algorithm to an iOS-based demonstration.	Semantic Scholar
We highlight that the proposed work is a reliable, complete, and versatile system that is applicable for different applications that require high accuracy in localization.	Semantic Scholar
We open source our implementations for both PCs (https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono) and iOS mobile devices ( https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mobile).	Semantic Scholar
This work proposes a robust regression framework with nonconvex loss function.	Semantic Scholar
Two regression formulations are presented based on the Laplace kernel-induced loss (LK-loss).	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we illustrate that the LK-loss function is a nice approximation for the zero-norm.	Semantic Scholar
However, nonconvexity of the LK-loss makes it difficult to optimize.	Semantic Scholar
A continuous optimization method is developed to solve the proposed framework.	Semantic Scholar
The problems are formulated as DC (difference of convex functions) programming.	Semantic Scholar
The corresponding DC algorithms (DCAs) converge linearly.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the proposed algorithms are applied directly to determine the hardness of licorice seeds using near-infrared spectral data with noisy input.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments in eight spectral regions show that the proposed methods improve generalization compared with the traditional support vector regressions (SVR), especially in high-frequency regions.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on several benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve better results than the traditional regression methods in most of data sets we have considered.	Semantic Scholar
For mobile robots that operate in complex, uncontrolled environments, estimating air flow models can be of great importance.	Semantic Scholar
Aerial robots use air flow models to plan optimal navigation paths and to avoid turbulence-ridden areas.	Semantic Scholar
Search and rescue platforms use air flow models to infer the location of gas leaks.	Semantic Scholar
Environmental monitoring robots enrich pollution distribution maps by integrating the information conveyed by an air flow model.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present an air flow modelling algorithm that uses wind data collected at a sparse number of locations to estimate joint probability distributions over wind speed and direction at given query locations.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm uses a novel extrapolation approach that models the air flow as a linear combination of laminar and turbulent components.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluated the prediction capabilities of our algorithm with data collected with an aerial robot during several exploration runs.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that our algorithm has a high degree of stability with respect to parameter selection while outperforming conventional extrapolation approaches.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we applied our proposed approach in an industrial application, where the characterization of a ventilation system is supported by a ground mobile robot.	Semantic Scholar
We compared multiple air flow maps recorded over several months by estimating stability maps using the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the distributions.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that, despite local differences, similar air flow patterns prevail over time.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we corroborated the validity of our results with knowledge from human experts.	Semantic Scholar
The present paper aims to propose a simple method to realize mutual information maximization for better interpretation and generalization.	Semantic Scholar
To train neural networks and obtain better performance, neurons should impartially consider as many input patterns as possible.	Semantic Scholar
Simultaneously, and especially for ease of interpretation, they should represent characteristics specific to certain input patterns as faithfully as possible.	Semantic Scholar
This contradiction can be solved by introducing mutual information between neurons and input patterns.	Semantic Scholar
However, because of the complicated computational procedures associated with mutual information maximization, it has been difficult to apply mutual information maximization to actual problems.	Semantic Scholar
Though many simplified methods have been developed so far, they have not necessarily been applied with success, in particular to large-scale practical problems.	Semantic Scholar
To further aid simplification, here we propose a new computational method to realize mutual information.	Semantic Scholar
One of the main characteristics of this new method is the consideration of multiple neural networks when defining mutual information, thereby simplifying the method.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, learning is also simplified by using the indirect, independent, and fast learning of the potential method.	Semantic Scholar
This method was applied to two well known data sets: the Australian credit data and on-line popularity data set.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results showed that mutual information could be increased via the present method.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, mutual information maximization was accompanied by an increase in generalization and interpretation performance, mainly due to the simple internal representations.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a method to control a quadrotor with a neural network trained using reinforcement learning techniques.	Semantic Scholar
With reinforcement learning, a common network can be trained to directly map state to actuator command making any predefined control structure obsolete for training.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we present a new learning algorithm that differs from the existing ones in certain aspects.	Semantic Scholar
Our algorithm is conservative but stable for complicated tasks.	Semantic Scholar
We found that it is more applicable to controlling a quadrotor than existing algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the performance of the trained policy both in simulation and with a real quadrotor.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments show that our policy network can react to step response relatively accurately.	Semantic Scholar
With the same policy, we also demonstrate that we can stabilize the quadrotor in the air even under very harsh initialization (manually throwing it upside-down in the air with an initial velocity of 5 m/s).	Semantic Scholar
Computation time of evaluating the policy is only 7  $\mu$s per time step, which is two orders of magnitude less than common trajectory optimization algorithms with an approximated model.	Semantic Scholar
Object class segmentation is a computer vision task which requires labeling each pixel of an image with the class of the object it belongs to.	Semantic Scholar
Deep convolutional neural networks (DNN) are able to learn and take advantage of local spatial correlations required for this task.	Semantic Scholar
They are, however, restricted by their small, fixed-sized filters, which limits their ability to learn long-range dependencies.	Semantic Scholar
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), on the other hand, do not suffer from this restriction.	Semantic Scholar
Their iterative interpretation allows them to model long-range dependencies by propagating activity.	Semantic Scholar
This property is especially useful when labeling video sequences, where both spatial and temporal long-range dependencies occur.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, a novel RNN architecture for object class segmentation is presented.	Semantic Scholar
We investigate several ways to train such a network.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our models on the challenging NYU Depth v2 dataset for object class segmentation and obtain competitive results.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a novel imbalance learning method for binary classes is proposed, named as Post-Boosting of classification boundary for Imbalanced data (PBI), which can significantly improve the performance of any trained neural networks (NN) classification boundary.	Semantic Scholar
The procedure of PBI simply consists of two steps: an (imbalanced) NN learning method is first applied to produce a classification boundary, which is then adjusted by PBI under the geometric mean (G-mean).	Semantic Scholar
For data imbalance, the geometric mean of the accuracies of both minority and majority classes is considered, that is statistically more suitable than the common metric accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
PBI also has the following advantages over traditional imbalance methods: (i) PBI can significantly improve the classification accuracy on minority class while improving or keeping that on majority class as well; (ii) PBI is suitable for large data even with high imbalance ratio (up to 0.001).	Semantic Scholar
For evaluation of (i), a new metric called Majority loss/Minority advance ratio (MMR) is proposed that evaluates the loss ratio of majority class to minority class.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments have been conducted for PBI and several imbalance learning methods over benchmark datasets of different sizes, different imbalance ratios, and different dimensionalities.	Semantic Scholar
By analyzing the experimental results, PBI is shown to outperform other imbalance learning methods on almost all datasets.	Semantic Scholar

Microrobotics has the potential to revolutionize many applications including targeted material delivery, assembly, and surgery.	Semantic Scholar
The same properties that promise breakthrough solutions—small size and large populations—present unique challenges for controlling motion.	Semantic Scholar
Robotic manipulation usually assumes intelligent agents, not particle systems manipulated by a global signal.	Semantic Scholar
To identify the key parameters for particle manipulation, we used a collection of online games in which players steer swarms of up to 500 particles to complete manipulation challenges.	Semantic Scholar
We recorded statistics from more than 10 000 players.	Semantic Scholar
Inspired by techniques in which human operators performed well, we investigate controllers that use only the mean and variance of the swarm.	Semantic Scholar
We prove that mean position is controllable and provide conditions under which variance is controllable.	Semantic Scholar
We next derive automatic controllers for these and a hysteresis-based switching control to regulate the first two moments of the particle distribution.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we employ these controllers as primitives for an object manipulation task and implement all controllers on 100 kilobots controlled by the direction of a global light source.	Semantic Scholar
In the present paper, a dynamic analysis is presented, comparing three snake-like robot gaits: lateral undulation, sidewinding locomotion, and sinus-lifting motion.	Semantic Scholar
To simplify calculations, sidewinding locomotion and sinus-lifting motion are considered planar movements.	Semantic Scholar
Vertical movements are assumed to be small but play a critical role in change where contacts are made.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, the normal forces acting on grounded links and the torques applied to pitch joints can be calculated by solving equilibrium equations.	Semantic Scholar
The tradeoff between locomotion speed and energy efficiency is studied for all three gaits, at eight different environmental settings distinguished by friction coefficients.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation results reveal that sinus-lifting motion and sidewinding locomotion are generally more energy-efficient gaits than is lateral undulation.	Semantic Scholar
More specifically, if the anisotropy in friction is large enough, sinus-lifting motion is the most energy-efficient gait; otherwise, sidewinding locomotion is more efficient.	Semantic Scholar
However, there are some critical speeds at which the most efficient gait changes, in some environmental settings.	Semantic Scholar

Reliable state estimation is crucial for stable planning and control of legged locomotion.	Semantic Scholar
A fundamental component of a state estimator in legged platforms is Leg Odometry, which only requires information about kinematics and contacts.	Semantic Scholar
Many legged robots use dedicated sensors on each foot to detect ground contacts.	Semantic Scholar
However, this choice is impractical for many agile legged robots in field operations, as these sensors often degrade and break.	Semantic Scholar
Instead, this paper focuses on the development of a robust Leg Odometry module, which does not require contact sensors.	Semantic Scholar
The module estimates the probability of reliable contact and detects foot impacts using internal force sensing.	Semantic Scholar
This knowledge is then used to improve the kinematics-inertial state estimate of the robot's base.	Semantic Scholar
We show how our approach can reach comparable performance to systems with foot sensors.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experimental results lasting over 1 h are presented on our 85 $\text{kg}$ quadrupedal robot HyQ carrying out a variety of gaits.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we develop theoretical foundations for a new class of rehabilitation robot: body-powered devices that route power between a user's joints.	Semantic Scholar
By harvesting power from a healthy joint to assist an impaired joint, novel bimanual and self-assist therapies are enabled.	Semantic Scholar
This approach complements existing robotic therapies aimed at promoting recovery of motor function after neurological injury.	Semantic Scholar
We employ hydraulic transmissions for routing power, or equivalently for coupling the motions of a user's joints.	Semantic Scholar
Fluid power routed through flexible tubing imposes constraints within a limb or between homologous joints across the body.	Semantic Scholar
Variable transmissions allow constraints to be steered on the fly, and simple valve switching realizes free space and locked motion.	Semantic Scholar
We examine two methods for realizing variable hydraulic transmissions: using valves to switch among redundant cylinders (digital hydraulics) or using an intervening electromechanical link.	Semantic Scholar
For both methods, we present a rigorous mathematical framework for describing and controlling the resulting constraints.	Semantic Scholar
Theoretical developments are supported by experiments using a prototype fluid-power exoskeleton.	Semantic Scholar
The ability to accurately predict changes of the carbon and energy balance on a regional scale is of great importance for assessing the effect of land use changes on carbon sequestration under future climate conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Here, a suite of land cover-specific Distributed Time Delay Neural Networks with a parameter adoption algorithm optimized through Bayesian regularization was used to model the statewide atmospheric exchange of CO2, water vapor, and energy in Oregon with its strong spatial gradients of climate and land cover.	Semantic Scholar
The network models were trained with eddy covariance data from 9 atmospheric flux towers.	Semantic Scholar
Compared to results derived with more common regression networks utilizing non-delayed input vectors, the performance of the DTDNN models was significantly improved with an average increase of the coefficients of determination of 64%.	Semantic Scholar
The optimized models were applied in combination with downscaled climate projections of the CMIP5 project to calculate future changes in the cycle of carbon, associated with a prescribed conversion of conventional grass-crops to hybrid poplar plantations for biofuel production in Oregon.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that under future RCP8.5 climate conditions the total statewide NEP increases by 0.87 TgC per decade until 2050 without any land use changes.	Semantic Scholar
With all non-forage grass completely converted to hybrid poplar the NEP averages 32.9 TgC in 2046-2050, an increase of 9%.	Semantic Scholar
Through comparisons with the results of a Bayesians inversion study, the results presented demonstrate that DTDNN models are a specifically well-suited approach to use the available data from flux networks to assess changes in biosphere-atmosphere exchange triggered by massive land use conversion superimposed on a changing climate.

Mining frequent subgraphs from a collection of input graphs is an important task for exploratory data analysis on graph data.	Semantic Scholar
However, if the input graphs contain sensitive information, releasing discovered frequent subgraphs may pose considerable threats to individual privacy.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study the problem of frequent subgraph mining (FSM) under the rigorous differential privacy model.	Semantic Scholar
We present a two-phase differentially private FSM algorithm, which is referred to as <italic>DFG</italic>.	Semantic Scholar
In <italic>DFG</italic>, frequent subgraphs are privately identified in the first phase, and the noisy support of each identified frequent subgraph is calculated in the second phase.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, to privately identity frequent subgraphs, we propose a frequent subgraph identification approach, which can improve the accuracy of discovered frequent subgraphs through candidate pruning.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, to compute the noisy support of each identified frequent subgraph, we devise a lattice-based noisy support computation approach, which leverages the inclusion relations between the discovered frequent subgraphs to improve the accuracy of the noisy supports.	Semantic Scholar

Given two consecutive RGB-D images, we propose a model that estimates a dense three-dimensional (3D) motion field, also known as scene flow.	Semantic Scholar
We take advantage of the fact that in robot manipulation scenarios, scenes often consist of a set of rigidly moving objects.	Semantic Scholar
Our model jointly estimates the following: First, the segmentation of the scene into an unknown but finite number of objects, second, the motion trajectories of these objects, and finally, the object scene flow.	Semantic Scholar
We employ an hourglass, deep neural network architecture.	Semantic Scholar
In the encoding stage, the RGB and depth images undergo spatial compression and correlation.	Semantic Scholar
In the decoding stage, the model outputs three images containing a per-pixel estimate of the corresponding object center as well as object translation and rotation.	Semantic Scholar
This forms the basis for inferring the object segmentation and final object scene flow.	Semantic Scholar
To evaluate our model, we generated a new and challenging, large scale, synthetic dataset that is specifically targeted at robotic manipulation: It contains a large number of scenes with a very diverse set of simultaneously moving 3D objects and is recorded with a simulated, static RGB-D camera.	Semantic Scholar
In quantitative experiments, we show that we outperform state-of-the-art scene flow and motion-segmentation methods on this data set.	Semantic Scholar
In qualitative experiments, we show how our learned model transfers to challenging real-world scenes, visually generating better results than existing methods.	Semantic Scholar
Goal: P300 spellers are among the most popular types of brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) and are extremely useful assistive devices that enable severely disabled patients to communicate.	Semantic Scholar
However, P300 speller performances should be further improved to translate laboratory designs into practical applications.	Semantic Scholar
We aimed to design a new speller paradigm that could evoke higher event-related potentials (ERPs) than traditional P300 spellers, thus improving the performance of BCI systems.	Semantic Scholar
Methods: We proposed a new P300 speller paradigm based on three-dimensional (3-D) stereo visual stimuli.	Semantic Scholar
In this paradigm, flashing buttons are presented in 3-D stereo form.	Semantic Scholar
We designed two experiments, one that tested a traditional two-dimensional (2-D) speller and another that tested the proposed 3-D speller.	Semantic Scholar
Twelve healthy volunteers participated in our experiments.	Semantic Scholar
We compared the ERPs elicited by the 2-D speller and the 3-D speller, and we also compared the classification accuracy, information transfer rate (ITR), and user workload between the two paradigms.	Semantic Scholar
Results: The 3-D P300 speller elicited higher amplitudes of P300 waveforms than the traditional 2-D P300 speller.	Semantic Scholar
The online experimental results showed that the classification accuracy and the ITR were significantly improved with the 3-D P300 speller.	Semantic Scholar
We also found that the user workload of the 3-D P300 speller was significantly lower than that of the 2-D P300 speller.	Semantic Scholar
Conclusion : The proposed 3-D P300 speller based on stereo visual stimuli outperformed a traditional 2-D P300 speller.	Semantic Scholar
This finding indicates that our 3-D paradigm offers a new method that will improve the performance of P300 BCI systems.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study a novel variant of obstructed nearest neighbor queries, namely, <italic>range-based obstructed nearest neighbor</italic> (RONN) search.	Semantic Scholar
As a natural generalization of <italic>continuous obstructed nearest-neighbor</italic> (CONN), an RONN query retrieves a set of <italic>obstructed nearest neighbors</italic> corresponding to every point in a specified range.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a new index, namely binary obstructed tree (called <italic>OB-tree</italic>), for indexing complex objects in the obstructed space.	Semantic Scholar
The novelty of OB-tree lies in the idea of <italic>dividing the obstructed space into non-obstructed subspaces</italic>, aiming to efficiently retrieve highly qualified candidates for RONN processing.	Semantic Scholar
We develop an algorithm for construction of the OB-tree and propose a space division scheme, called <italic>optimal obstacle balance</italic> (OOB2) scheme, to address the tree balance problem.	Semantic Scholar
Accordingly, we propose an efficient algorithm, called <italic>RONN by OB-tree Acceleration</italic> (RONN-OBA), which exploits the OB-tree and a binary traversal order of data objects to accelerate query processing of RONN.	Semantic Scholar

In much of the world, sugarcane is planted in a mechanized fashion using billets, which are shorter segments of cane harvested and cut by a combine harvester.	Semantic Scholar
The mechanized harvesting process can damage billets, which introduces pathways for disease, and overall reduction of billet quality.	Semantic Scholar
Compared to whole stalk planting with manual methods, growers must approximately double the planting density when using billets.	Semantic Scholar
As a first step toward improving sugarcane production with robotics technologies, this letter presents the analysis of sugarcane billet quality using computer vision.	Semantic Scholar
A large sample of sugarcane billets was harvested at a research farm in Houma, LA, USA.	Semantic Scholar
A group of crop scientists and growers then categorized the billets into six classes of damage according to physical features visually evident.	Semantic Scholar
To better understand the correlation between the type of damage and sugarcane germination, we planted 120 samples from each class in test plots and then recorded plant emergence rates.	Semantic Scholar
A data set of billet imagery was collected with charge-coupled device and stereovision sensors in both outdoor and indoor lighting conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Offline image processing resulted in approximately 90% successful classification of sugarcane billet damage.	Semantic Scholar

Several methods have been proposed, but they have some limits such as with limited kind of data or limited classification accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
In our former work, the classification accuracy on monotonic classification has been improved by fusing monotonic decision trees, but it always has a complex classification model.	Semantic Scholar
This work aims to find a monotonic classifier to process both nominal and numeric data by fusing complete monotonic decision trees.	Semantic Scholar
Through finding the completed feature subsets based on discernibility matrix on ordinal dataset, a set of monotonic decision trees can be obtained directly and automatically, on which the rank is still preserved.	Semantic Scholar
Fewer decision trees are needed, which will serve as base classifiers to construct a decision forest fused complete monotonic decision trees.	Semantic Scholar
The experiment results on 10 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the number of base classifiers effectively and then simplify classification model, and obtain good classification performance simultaneously.	Semantic Scholar
Self-driving vehicles rely on detailed semantic maps of the environment for operating.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a method to autonomously generate such a semantic map enriched with knowledge of parking spot locations.	Semantic Scholar
Our method detects and uses parked vehicles in the surroundings to estimate parking lot topology and infer vacant parking spots via a graph-based approach.	Semantic Scholar
We show that our method works for parking lot structures in different environments, such as structured parking lots, unstructured/unmarked parking lots, and typical suburban environments.	Semantic Scholar
Using the proposed graph-based approach to infer the parking lot structure, we can extend the estimated parking spots by  $57\%$, averaged over six different areas with ten trials each.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that the accuracy of our algorithm increases when combining multiple trials over multiple days.	Semantic Scholar
With ten trials combined, we managed to estimate the whole parking lot structure and detected all parking spots in four out of the six evaluated areas.	Semantic Scholar
‘‘Fabric-embedded sensors” are of growing interest in clinical diagnostics and rehabilitation studies that desire the measurement and analysis of human movement outside the laboratory environment.	Semantic Scholar
A major issue limiting their usage is the undesired effect of fabric motion artefacts corrupting movement signals.	Semantic Scholar
While supervised calibration methods can be used to eliminate these artefacts, these methods make assumptions on the fabric motion, and are unable to address changes in user motion (e.g., locomotion speed) or clothing deformation.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, an unsupervised latent space regression method is presented for learning body movements from fabric motion corrupted sensors, while simultaneously allowing for automatic recalibration.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments in this letter show that unsupervised gait learning performs equally as well as supervised learning when removing motion artefacts.	Semantic Scholar
This allows for the implementation of adaptive motion artefact methods in real-world sensor-embedded clothing.	Semantic Scholar

Semantic Scholar
The proposed calibration algorithms succeed in their computational and memory efficiency and suitability for the real-time implementation on embedded systems.	Semantic Scholar
Both simulation and experiments on large-scale bulky unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are provided to show that the proposed formulation along with the two solvers can successfully calibrate large misalignments under small and casual movements of the UAV.	Semantic Scholar
Embedding network data into a low-dimensional vector space has shown promising performance for many real-world applications, such as node classification and entity retrieval.	Semantic Scholar
However, most existing methods focused only on leveraging network structure.	Semantic Scholar
For social networks, besides the network structure, there also exists rich information about social actors, such as user profiles of friendship networks and textual content of citation networks.	Semantic Scholar
These rich attribute information of social actors reveal the homophily effect, exerting huge impacts on the formation of social networks.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we explore the rich evidence source of attributes in social networks to improve network embedding.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a generic Attributed Social Network Embedding framework (ASNE), which learns representations for social actors (i.e., nodes) by preserving both the structural proximity and attribute proximity.	Semantic Scholar
While the structural proximity captures the global network structure, the attribute proximity accounts for the homophily effect.	Semantic Scholar
To justify our proposal, we conduct extensive experiments on four real-world social networks.	Semantic Scholar
Compared to the state-of-the-art network embedding approaches, ASNE can learn more informative representations, achieving substantial gains on the tasks of link prediction and node classification.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, ASNE significantly outperforms  node2vec with an 8.2 percent relative improvement on the link prediction task, and a 12.7 percent gain on the node classification task.	Semantic Scholar

Needle insertion is a minimally invasive procedure finding applications in biopsy, ablation, drug delivery, and cancer therapy.	Semantic Scholar
Prostate brachytherapy is a therapeutic procedure where radioactive agents are implanted within the prostate using long needles for the purpose of cancer irradiation.	Semantic Scholar
During insertion, each inserted needle needs to remain on a straight path due to dosage distribution requirements.	Semantic Scholar
This is difficult to achieve as the beveled needle tip causes needle deflection.	Semantic Scholar
A common method for the surgeon to steer beveled-tip needles manually is intermittent axial rotation.	Semantic Scholar
Over the last decade, substantial advancements have been made in robotic assistance during needle steering.	Semantic Scholar
The most common steering input has, however, been axial needle rotation.	Semantic Scholar
A novel needle steering input proposed and investigated recently by our research group is lateral needle actuation near the needle's entry point into tissue.	Semantic Scholar
The investigations have yielded promising results with respect to the overall steering potential and improving the steerability of the needle.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, a model-based control algorithm is presented that uses only lateral needle actuation to minimize needle deflection at the final insertion depth.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm consists of two stages: an off-line trajectory planning stage and an on-line trajectory adjustment stage.	Semantic Scholar
Insertion experiments into phantom tissue were carried out to validate the proposed control algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that the algorithm is able to steer the needle toward the desired target whereas only using lateral needle actuation as steering input.	Semantic Scholar

In this paper we present a segmentation proposal method which employs a box-hypotheses generation step followed by a lightweight segmentation strategy.	Semantic Scholar
Inspired by interactive segmentation, for each automatically placed bounding-box we compute a precise segmentation mask.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce diversity in segmentation strategies enhancing a generic model performance exploiting class-independent regional appearance features.	Semantic Scholar
Foreground probability scores are learned from groups of objects with peculiar characteristics to specialize segmentation models.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate results comparable to the state-of-the-art on PASCAL VOC 2012 and a further improvement by merging our proposals with those of a recent solution.	Semantic Scholar
The ability to generalize to unseen object categories is demonstrated on Microsoft COCO 2014.	Semantic Scholar

In this article, we present plate and reinforced flexure (PARF) fabrication, an inexpensive, rapid fabrication technique for robot mechanisms inspired by the smart composite manufacturing (SCM) used in VelociRoACH [1] and RoboBee [2] designs.	Semantic Scholar
PARF extends SCM to larger sizes at low costs.	Semantic Scholar
We used PARF to develop a meter-scale hexapedal robot, BigANT [3], a design we made publicly available.	Semantic Scholar
Manufacture of BigANT requires minimal tooling-foam board, tape, a saw blade, and a knife; the chassis costs &lt; US$20 in materials, encouraging its use in research, education, and recreation.	Semantic Scholar
We present a study of PARF joints, showing several variations spanning a range of fabrication effort and mechanical properties.	Semantic Scholar
PARF promises the possibility of quickly and inexpensively building robot mechanisms for tasks as the requirements arise, rather than relying on prefabricated robot bodies.	Semantic Scholar
To ensure patient safety, many hospitals have implemented rapid response process to provide care to acute patients who experience acute physiological deterioration.	Semantic Scholar
However, those patients sometimes have to wait for a long time before an appropriate decision can be made, due to low availability of care providers.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we develop an analytical model with the objective of reducing patient waiting time.	Semantic Scholar
A method to evaluate patient waiting time during deterioration process is presented.	Semantic Scholar
Structural properties are discussed.	Semantic Scholar
Continuous improvement issues are investigated by introducing an indicator to identify the bottleneck care provider whose response time reduction could lead to the largest decrease in patient waiting time.	Semantic Scholar
A simple approximation formula of bottleneck indicator is derived.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, a set of numerical experiments are performed to validate the model.	Semantic Scholar
The ability of legged robots to traverse obstacles is typically achieved using either independently actuated multiple degree-of-freedom (DOF) designs that require numerous sensors and complex control schemes, or through compliance in single-DOF legs.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, a third option is explored, combining these approaches by adding a second, passively triggered mobility to a single-DOF leg mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
Contact of the leg with an obstacle during the swing phase activates a variation in the mechanical transmission of this leg which, through proper design, can be used to overcome this obstacle.	Semantic Scholar
Using the Hoeckens-Pantograph leg architecture as an example, the conditions required for overcoming colliding objects are first presented.	Semantic Scholar
As will be shown, they relate to the velocity of the leg endpoint along its trajectory.	Semantic Scholar
To obtain this velocity, the kinematics of the mechanism are determined using planar screw theory.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, experiments are presented showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach, keeping control simplicity while allowing for a greater robustness in the traversable terrains.	Semantic Scholar
Twitter and other microblogs have rapidly become a significant mean of information propagation in today's web.	Semantic Scholar
Understanding the main factors that make certain pieces of information spread quickly in these platforms has emerged as a popular topic.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, as a simple yet powerful way of disseminating useful information, retweeting has attracted much interest.	Semantic Scholar
Existing methods for retweets have been conducted for analyzing the social network structure, or understanding the retweeting mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
However, little attention is paid to whether users' emotion will affect users' retweeting behavior.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study the user emotion problem in a large social network.	Semantic Scholar
Particularly, we consider users' retweet behaviors and focus on investigating whether users with a certain emotional status will retweet the tweet corresponding with users' current mood from their friends.	Semantic Scholar
In order to achieve this goal, we propose a retweeting prediction framework.	Semantic Scholar
First, we construct a model of emotion detection via considering two kinds of emotional signals; second, we extract possible retweeted friends and tweets; third, based on the first two steps, we obtain Top-N retweets using Learn-to-Rank method.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments are performed on two real-world datasets, the Twitter network and Obama-McCain Debate dataset, with comprehensive measurements.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results demonstrate that our retweeting prediction framework has substantial advantages over commonly used retweeting prediction approaches in predicting retweeting behaviors.	Semantic Scholar
Consider Precision in Twitter network as an example.	Semantic Scholar
For the Top-N stage, our method can, on average, increase by 15.2% and 11.2% in relation to Tweet(+SV) and User(+ED), respectively.	Semantic Scholar
We find that emotion is a vital feature which affects retweetability.	Semantic Scholar
The human hand represents a complex fascinating system with highly sensitive sensory capabilities and dexterous grasping and manipulation functionalities.	Semantic Scholar
As a consequence, estimating the hand pose and at the same time having the capability to provide haptic feedback in a wearable way may benefit areas such as rehabilitation, human–robot interaction, gaming, and many more.	Semantic Scholar
Existing solutions allow us to accurately measure the hand configuration and provide effective force feedback to the user.	Semantic Scholar
However, they have limited wearability/portability.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present the wearable sensing/actuation system glove for enhanced sensing and touching (GESTO).	Semantic Scholar
It is based on inertial and magnetic sensors for hand tracking, coupled with cutaneous devices for the force feedback rendering.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike vision-based tracking systems, the sensing glove does not suffer from occlusion problems and lighting conditions.	Semantic Scholar
We properly designed the cutaneous devices in order to reduce possible interferences with the magnetic sensors and performed an experimental validation on ten healthy subjects.	Semantic Scholar
In order to measure the estimation accuracy of GESTO, we used a high-precision optical tracker.	Semantic Scholar
A comparison between using the glove with and without the haptic devices shows that the presence of them does not induce a statistically significant increase in the estimation error.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results revealed the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	Semantic Scholar
The accuracy of our system,  $3.32^\circ$ mean estimation error in the worst case, is comparable with the human ability of discriminating finger joint angle.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, a new framework, Fredholm learning, was proposed for semisupervised learning problems based on solving a regularized Fredholm integral equation.	Semantic Scholar
It allows a natural way to incorporate unlabeled data into learning algorithms to improve their prediction performance.	Semantic Scholar
Despite rapid progress on implementable algorithms with theoretical guarantees, the generalization ability of Fredholm kernel learning has not been studied.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we focus on investigating the generalization performance of a family of classification algorithms, referred to as Fredholm kernel regularized classifiers.	Semantic Scholar
We prove that the corresponding learning rate can achieve ( is the number of labeled samples) in a limiting case.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, a representer theorem is provided for the proposed regularized scheme, which underlies its applications.	Semantic Scholar
Online two-dimensional (2D) multi-object tracking (MOT) is a challenging task when the objects of interest have similar appearances.	Semantic Scholar
In that case, the motion of objects is another helpful cue for tracking and discriminating multiple objects.	Semantic Scholar
However, when using a single moving camera for online 2D MOT, observable motion cues are contaminated by global camera movements and, thus, are not always predictable.	Semantic Scholar
To deal with unexpected camera motion, we propose a new data association method that effectively exploits structural constraints in the presence of large camera motion.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, to reduce incorrect associations with mis-detections and false positives, we develop a novel event aggregation method to integrate assignment costs computed by structural constraints.	Semantic Scholar
We also utilize structural constraints to track missing objects when they are re-detected again.	Semantic Scholar
By doing this, identities of the missing objects can be retained continuously.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results validated the effectiveness of the proposed data association algorithm under unexpected camera motions.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, tracking results on a large number of benchmark datasets demonstrated that the proposed MOT algorithm performs robustly and favorably against various online methods in terms of several quantitative metrics, and that its performance is comparable to offline methods.	Semantic Scholar
One major goal of vision is to infer physical models of objects, surfaces, and their layout from sensors.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we aim to interpret indoor scenes from one RGBD image.	Semantic Scholar
Our representation encodes the layout of orthogonal walls and the extent of objects, modeled with CAD-like 3D shapes.	Semantic Scholar
We parse both the visible and occluded portions of the scene and all observable objects, producing a complete 3D parse.	Semantic Scholar
Such a scene interpretation is useful for robotics and visual reasoning, but difficult to produce due to the well-known challenge of segmentation, the high degree of occlusion, and the diversity of objects in indoor scenes.	Semantic Scholar
We take a data-driven approach, generating sets of potential object regions, matching to regions in training images, and transferring and aligning associated 3D models while encouraging fit to observations and spatial consistency.	Semantic Scholar
We use support inference to aid interpretation and propose a retrieval scheme that uses convolutional neural networks to classify regions and retrieve objects with similar shapes.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the performance of our method on our newly annotated NYUd v2 dataset (Silberman et al., in: Computer vision-ECCV, 2012, pp 746–760, 2012) with detailed 3D shapes.	Semantic Scholar
Uncovering causal relationships in data is a major objective of data analytics.	Semantic Scholar
Currently, there is a need for scalable and automated methods for causal relationship exploration in data.	Semantic Scholar
Classification methods are fast and they could be practical substitutes for finding causal signals in data.	Semantic Scholar
However, classification methods are not designed for causal discovery and a classification method may find false causal signals and miss the true ones.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we develop a causal decision tree (CDT) where nodes have causal interpretations.	Semantic Scholar
Our method follows a well-established causal inference framework and makes use of a classic statistical test to establish the causal relationship between a predictor variable and the outcome variable.	Semantic Scholar
At the same time, by taking the advantages of normal decision trees, a CDT provides a compact graphical representation of the causal relationships, and the construction of a CDT is fast as a result of the divide and conquer strategy employed, making CDTs practical for representing and finding causal signals in large data sets.	Semantic Scholar
Experiment results demonstrate that CDTs can identify meaningful causal relationships and the CDT algorithm is scalable.	Semantic Scholar
Flatland was an immersive “in-the-wild” experimental theater and technology project, undertaken with the goal of developing systems that could assist “real-world” pedestrian navigation for both vision-impaired (VI) and sighted individuals, while also exploring inclusive and equivalent cultural experiences for VI and sighted audiences.	Semantic Scholar
A novel shape-changing handheld haptic navigation device, the “Animotus,” was developed.	Semantic Scholar
The device has the ability to modify its form in the user's grasp to communicate heading and proximity to navigational targets.	Semantic Scholar
Flatland provided a unique opportunity to comparatively study the use of novel navigation devices with a large group of individuals (79 sighted, 15 VI) who were primarily attending a theater production rather than an experimental study.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present our findings on comparing the navigation performance (measured in terms of efficiency, average pace, and time facing targets) and opinions of VI and sighted users of the Animotus as they negotiated the 112 m2 production environment.	Semantic Scholar
Differences in navigation performance were nonsignificant across VI and sighted individuals and a similar range of opinions on device function and engagement spanned both groups.	Semantic Scholar
We believe more structured device familiarization, particularly for VI users, could improve performance and incorrect technology expectations (such as obstacle avoidance capability), which influenced overall opinion.	Semantic Scholar
This paper is intended to aid the development of future inclusive technologies and cultural experiences.	Semantic Scholar
Finding similar questions from historical archives has been applied to question answering, with well theoretical underpinnings and great practical success.	Semantic Scholar
Nevertheless, each question in the returned candidate pool often associates with multiple answers, and hence users have to painstakingly browse a lot before finding the correct one.	Semantic Scholar
To alleviate such problem, we present a novel scheme to rank answer candidates via pairwise comparisons.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, it consists of one offline learning component and one online search component.	Semantic Scholar
In the offline learning component, we first automatically establish the positive, negative, and neutral training samples in terms of preference pairs guided by our data-driven observations.	Semantic Scholar
We then present a novel model to jointly incorporate these three types of training samples.	Semantic Scholar
The closed-form solution of this model is derived.	Semantic Scholar
In the online search component, we first collect a pool of answer candidates for the given question via finding its similar questions.	Semantic Scholar
We then sort the answer candidates by leveraging the offline trained model to judge the preference orders.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on the real-world vertical and general community-based question answering datasets have comparatively demonstrated its robustness and promising performance.	Semantic Scholar
Also, we have released the codes and data to facilitate other researchers.	Semantic Scholar
An Orthogonal Defense Mechanism (ODM) was designed and implemented to improve the detection of cyber attacks on an operational water treatment plant (WTreat).	Semantic Scholar
Successive design iterations led to an architecture that was prototyped and experimentally evaluated.	Semantic Scholar
ODM unobtrusively monitors WTreat using an independent network and gathers data from multiple data sources to corroborate the state of the plant using a state model.	Semantic Scholar
ODM is independent of, i.e.	Semantic Scholar
orthogonal to, any detection and defense mechanism, such as rule-based intrusion detection, that may otherwise exist in WTreat.	Semantic Scholar
ODM uses invariants created from plant design to detect and report anomalies in processes.	Semantic Scholar
While the architecture of OD, and its prototype, are specific to a water treatment plant, the underlying design ideas are generic and could be applied to other public infrastructure systems.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study extensions to the Gaussian processes (GPs) continuous occupancy mapping problem.	Semantic Scholar
There are two classes of occupancy mapping problems that we particularly investigate.	Semantic Scholar
The first problem is related to mapping under pose uncertainty and how to propagate pose estimation uncertainty into the map inference.	Semantic Scholar
We develop expected kernel and expected submap notions to deal with uncertain inputs.	Semantic Scholar
In the second problem, we account for the complication of the robot's perception noise using warped Gaussian processes (WGPs).	Semantic Scholar
This approach allows for non-Gaussian noise in the observation space and captures the possible nonlinearity in that space better than standard GPs.	Semantic Scholar
The developed techniques can be applied separately or concurrently to a standard GP occupancy mapping problem.	Semantic Scholar
According to our experimental results, although taking into account pose uncertainty leads, as expected, to more uncertain maps, by modeling the nonlinearities present in the observation space WGPs improve the map quality.	Semantic Scholar
Surgical manipulators are increasingly capable of approaching deep-seated pathologies through convoluted pathways due to the advances in the field of continuum robotics.	Semantic Scholar
This class of robots can be, in most cases, accurately modeled as a chain of cylindrical shapes.	Semantic Scholar
In order to safely and seamlessly telemanipulate these robots, which have complex nonintuitive kinematics, haptic guidance schemes have been developed that rely on accurate proximity queries (PQ) to calculate the distance between the continuum robot and the anatomy.	Semantic Scholar
This letter introduces an approach to accurately model the continuum robots using cylindrical-shaped segments with spherical or flat caps and then efficiently calculate the shortest distance to a triangle mesh.	Semantic Scholar
Implementations of efficient, analytical narrow phase PQ calculations for simple and complex geometrical primitives suitable for parallel computing hardware are presented together with an experimental validation which show improved performance suitable for real-time robotic applications.	Semantic Scholar
An in silico experiment comparing various root-finding algorithms, which are commonly used in PQ calculation or other optimization tasks are compared to assess their suitability when executed on different hardware.	Semantic Scholar
The implications of these experimental results are discussed, in particular with regards to the selection of a suitable proximity query algorithm depending on the available parallel computing hardware.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, an outlook of future improvements for dense dynamic anatomies is presented.	Semantic Scholar
A conjecture originally made by Klein and Szekeres in 1932 (now commonly known as “Erdős–Szekeres” or “Happy Ending” conjecture) claims that for every $$m \ge 3$$ m ≥ 3 , every set of $$2^{m-2}+1$$ 2 m - 2 + 1 points in a general position (none three different points are collinear) contains a convex m-gon.	Semantic Scholar
The conjecture has been verified for $$m \le 6$$ m ≤ 6 .	Semantic Scholar
The case $$m=6$$ m = 6 was solved by Szekeres and Peters and required a huge computer enumeration that took “more than 3000 GHz hours”.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we improve the solution in several directions.	Semantic Scholar
By changing the problem representation, by employing symmetry-breaking and by using modern SAT solvers, we reduce the proving time to around only a half of an hour on an ordinary PC computer (i.e., our proof requires only around 1 GHz hour).	Semantic Scholar
Also, we formalize the proof within the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant, making it significantly more reliable.	Semantic Scholar
The solution of an LS-SVM has suffered from the problem of non-sparseness.	Semantic Scholar
The paper proposed to apply the KMP algorithm, with the number of support vectors as the regularization parameter, to tackle the non-sparseness problem of LS-SVMs.	Semantic Scholar
The idea of the kernel matching pursuit (KMP) algorithm was first revisited from the perspective of the QR decomposition of the kernel matrix on the training set.	Semantic Scholar
Strategies are further developed to select those support vectors which minimize the leave-one-out cross validation error of the resultant sparse LS-SVM model.	Semantic Scholar
It is demonstrated that the LOOCV of the sparse LS-SVM can be computed accurately and efficiently.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on benchmark datasets showed that, compared to the SVM and variants sparse LS-SVM models, the proposed sparse LS-SVM models developed upon KMP algorithms maintained comparable performance in terms of both accuracy and sparsity.	Semantic Scholar

Retroflexion during colonoscopy is typically only practiced in the wider proximal and distal ends of the large intestine owing to the stiff nature of the colonoscope.	Semantic Scholar
This inability to examine the proximal side of the majority of colon folds contributes to today's suboptimal colorectal cancer detection rates.	Semantic Scholar
We have developed an algorithm for autonomous retroflexion of a flexible endoscope that is actuated magnetically from the tip.	Semantic Scholar
The magnetic wrench applied on the tip of the endoscope is optimized in real time with data from pose detection to compute motions of the actuating magnet.	Semantic Scholar
This is the first example of a completely autonomous maneuver by a magnetic endoscope for exploration of the gastrointestinal tract.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach was validated in plastic tubes of various diameters with a success rate of 98.8% for separation distances up to 50 mm.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, a set of trials was conducted in an excised porcine colon observing a success rate of 100% with a mean time of 19.7 s. In terms of clinical safety, the maximum stress that is applied on the colon wall with our methodology is an order of magnitude below what would damage tissue.	Semantic Scholar
We consider Bayesian inference problems with computationally intensive likelihood functions.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a Gaussian process (GP)–based method to approximate the joint distribution of the unknown parameters and the data, built on recent work (Kandasamy, Schneider, & Póczos, 2015).	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we write the joint density approximately as a product of an approximate posterior density and an exponentiated GP surrogate.	Semantic Scholar
We then provide an adaptive algorithm to construct such an approximation, where an active learning method is used to choose the design points.	Semantic Scholar
With numerical examples, we illustrate that the proposed method has competitive performance against existing approaches for Bayesian computation.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a novel, decentralized control algorithm to address the problem of controlling of multiple, network connected, nonholonomic mobile robots to achieve a collision-free formation and heading consensus simultaneously.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach transforms the formation and heading consensus problem to a pose regulation problem.	Semantic Scholar
The pose is derived by a virtual graph, which is an isomorphic mapping of the graph of the network connected systems.	Semantic Scholar
If the system is holonomic, traditional consensus on the virtual graph can stabilize the real system to the desired formation.	Semantic Scholar
In the case of nonholonomic systems, such as mobile robots, each robot’s pose then is regulated to the known consensus pose by a novel smooth and continuous control law.	Semantic Scholar
The control law also induces the real robot systems to achieve not only the desired formation but also heading consensus.	Semantic Scholar
We prove the proposed control schemes are globally asymptotically stable.	Semantic Scholar
Theoretical analysis, several simulations, and experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	Semantic Scholar

Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) can be marked as a powerful tool for object and image classification and retrieval.	Semantic Scholar
However, the training stage of such networks is highly consuming in terms of storage space and time.	Semantic Scholar
Also, the optimization is still a challenging subject.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a fast DCNN based on Fast Wavelet Transform (FWT), intelligent dropout and layer skipping.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach led to improve the image retrieval accuracy as well as the searching time.	Semantic Scholar
This was possible thanks to three key advantages: First, the rapid way to compute the features using FWT.	Semantic Scholar
Second, the proposed intelligent dropout method is based on whether or not a unit is efficiently and not randomly selected.	Semantic Scholar
Third, it is possible to classify the image using efficient units of earlier layer(s) and skipping all the subsequent hidden layers directly to the output layer.	Semantic Scholar
Our experiments were performed on CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets and the obtained results are very promising.	Semantic Scholar
The self-localization capability is a crucial component for Unmanned Ground Vehicles in farming applications.	Semantic Scholar
Approaches based solely on visual cues or on a low-cost Global Positioning System (GPS) are easily prone to fail in such scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a robust and accurate three-dimensional (3-D) global pose estimation framework, designed to take full advantage of heterogeneous sensory data.	Semantic Scholar
By modeling the pose estimation problem as a pose graph optimization, our approach simultaneously mitigates the cumulative drift introduced by motion estimation systems (wheel odometry, visual odometry, etc) and the noise introduced by raw GPS readings.	Semantic Scholar
Along with a suitable motion model, our system also integrates two additional types of constraints, namely, a Digital Elevation Model and a Markov Random Field assumption.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate how using these additional cues substantially reduces the error along the altitude axis and, moreover, how this benefit spreads to the other components of the state.	Semantic Scholar
We report exhaustive experiments combining several sensor setups, showing accuracy improvements ranging from 37% to 76% with respect to the exclusive use of a GPS sensor.	Semantic Scholar
We show that our approach provides accurate results even if the GPS unexpectedly changes positioning mode.	Semantic Scholar
The code of our system along with the acquired datasets is released with this letter.	Semantic Scholar
When developing a robot, design iterations in the physical world are necessary, even though they are often costly and not systematic.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we present an automated iterative design process without using modeling or simulation, which we refer to as “model-free design optimization” based on Bayesian optimization.	Semantic Scholar
This letter particularly focuses on the cooptimization of morphology and controller, by using a mechanism to balance parameter specific costs (i.e., morphology samplings are more expensive than control ones) for effective and efficient design optimization processes.	Semantic Scholar
A hopping robot was employed for a feasibility analysis of the proposed optimization method, in which minimalistic two-dimensional and four-dimensional design optimization experiments were performed in real life.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that the proposed approach is capable of improving both of the robot design problems within a defined time limit.	Semantic Scholar
The method is also compared to optimization performances of a human designer under the same conditions.	Semantic Scholar
The automated method has advantage in finding the best solution more quickly in the four-dimensional search space, while the human optimization performs better in the two-dimensional case.	Semantic Scholar
The visual cortex is both extensive and intricate.	Semantic Scholar
Computational models are needed to clarify the relationships between its local mechanisms and high-level functions.	Semantic Scholar
The Stabilized Supralinear Network (SSN) model was recently shown to account for many receptive field phenomena in V1, and also to predict subtle receptive field properties that were subsequently confirmed in vivo.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we performed a preliminary exploration of whether the SSN is suitable for incorporation into large, functional models of the visual cortex, considering both its extensibility and computational tractability.	Semantic Scholar
First, whereas the SSN receives abstract orientation signals as input, we extended it to receive images (through a linear-nonlinear stage), and found that the extended version behaved similarly.	Semantic Scholar
Secondly, whereas the SSN had previously been studied in a monocular context, we found that it could also reproduce data on interocular transfer of surround suppression.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we reformulated the SSN as a convolutional neural network, and found that it scaled well on parallel hardware.	Semantic Scholar
These results provide additional support for the plausibility of the SSN as a model of lateral interactions in V1, and suggest that the SSN is well suited as a component of complex vision models.	Semantic Scholar
Future work will use the SSN to explore relationships between local network interactions and sophisticated vision processes in large networks.	Semantic Scholar
Hand–eye calibration is a classic problem in robotics that aims to find the transformation between two rigidly attached reference frames, usually a camera and a robot end-effector or a motion tracker.	Semantic Scholar
Most hand–eye calibration techniques require two data streams, one containing the eye (camera) motion and the other containing the hand (robot/tracker) motion, and the classic hand–eye formulation assumes that both data streams are fully synchronized.	Semantic Scholar
However, different motion capturing devices and cameras often have variable capture rates and timestamps that cannot always be easily triggered in sync.	Semantic Scholar
Although probabilistic approaches have been proposed to solve for nonsynchronized data streams, they are not able to deal with different capture rates.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a new approach for unsynchronized hand–eye calibration that is able to deal with different capture rates and time delays.	Semantic Scholar
Our method interpolates and resamples the signal with the lowest capture rate in a way that is consistent with the twist motion constraints of the hand–eye problem.	Semantic Scholar
Cross-correlation techniques are then used to produce two fully synchronized data streams that can be used to solve the hand–eye problem with classic methods.	Semantic Scholar
In our experimental section, we show promising validation results on simulation data and also on real data obtained from a robotic arm holding a camera.	Semantic Scholar
Progressive automation is a method that allows the operator to demonstrate a task a few times until the robot gradually learns to execute it autonomously.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we combine a novel structure of dynamic movement primitives (DMP) with variable stiffness control, to allow synchronization with the demonstrated motion during the operator's intervention.	Semantic Scholar
This structure enables the DMP to speed up or slow down depending on the human demonstration.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we present a variable stiffness controller to change the role of the robot between the follower and the leader based on the tracking error of the robot from the proposed DMP and on the guidance forces.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed variable stiffness controller is proved to be passive using energy tanks.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated experimentally.	Semantic Scholar
A control framework is proposed that autonomously modulates a dexterous grasp synergy to proactively prevent grasped object slip.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed controller offers a practical means of preventing slip in uncertain environments, such as upper-limb prosthetics applications.	Semantic Scholar
The controller was evaluated with slip prevention experiments in which a dexterous manipulator grasped four separate objects and was subsequently excited by a robotic arm.	Semantic Scholar
Results showed that the proposed strategy significantly reduced grasped object slip.	Semantic Scholar
Distant supervised relation extraction is an important task in the field of natural language processing.	Semantic Scholar
There are two main shortcomings for most state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
One is that they take all sentences of an entity pair as input, which would result in a large computational cost.	Semantic Scholar
But in fact, few of most relevant sentences are enough to recognize the relation of an entity pair.	Semantic Scholar
To tackle these problems, we propose a novel hierarchical selective attention network for relation extraction under distant supervision.	Semantic Scholar
Our model first selects most relevant sentences by taking coarse sentence-level attention on all sentences of an entity pair and then employs word-level attention to construct sentence representations and fine sentence-level attention to aggregate these sentence representations.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on a widely used dataset demonstrate that our method performs significantly better than most of existing methods.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents Rising STAR (RSTAR) a novel highly reconfigurable robot.	Semantic Scholar
RSTAR belongs to the family of the STAR robots with similar sprawling capabilities allowing it to run in a planar configuration, either upright or inverted and change its mechanics from the lateral to the sagittal planes.	Semantic Scholar
However, RSTAR is fitted with a new four bar extension mechanism (FBEM) allowing it to extend the distance between its body and legs.	Semantic Scholar
This combination of sprawling and extension mechanisms enables RSTAR to overcome extremely challenging obstacles, crawl over flexible and slippery surfaces and even climb vertically in a tube or between two walls.	Semantic Scholar
The robot can extend its height and width three-fold and move its center of mass both in the fore-aft and vertical directions.	Semantic Scholar
We first describe a kinematic model and the dynamical analysis conducted to improve the design of the robot and evaluate its strength and motor requirements.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this analysis, we designed and built a three-dimensional printed prototype and experimentally tested it.	Semantic Scholar
The robot can run upside down and climb over obstacles that are even higher than the diameter of its wheeled legs using a turtle-like gait.	Semantic Scholar
To increase its mobility, RSTAR can be fitted with wheels or spoked legs or a combination of the two, giving it superiorability to engage different terrains (see video).	Semantic Scholar
Autonomous trajectory generation through generalization requires a database of motion, which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a method for autonomous expansion of a database for the generation of compliant and accurate motion, achieved through the framework of compliant movement primitives (CMPs).	Semantic Scholar
These combine task-specific kinematic and corresponding feed-forward dynamic trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
The framework allows for generalization and modulation of dynamic behavior.	Semantic Scholar
Inspired by human sensorimotor learning abilities, we propose a novel method that can autonomously learn task-specific torque primitives (TPs) associated to given kinematic trajectories, encoded as dynamic movement primitives.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed algorithm is completely autonomous, and can be used to rapidly generate and expand the CMP database.	Semantic Scholar
Since CMPs are parameterized, statistical generalization can be used to obtain an initial TP estimate of a new CMP.	Semantic Scholar
Thereby, the learning rate of new CMPs can be significantly improved.	Semantic Scholar
The evaluation of the proposed approach on a Kuka LWR-4 robot performing a peg-in-hole task shows fast TP acquisition and accurate generalization estimates in real-world scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
Multi-label learning is a common machine learning problem arising from numerous real-world applications in diverse fields, e.g, natural language processing, bioinformatics, information retrieval and so on.	Semantic Scholar
Among various multi-label learning methods, the matrix completion approach has been regarded as a promising approach to transductive multi-label learning.	Semantic Scholar
By constructing a joint matrix comprising the feature matrix and the label matrix, the missing labels of test samples are regarded as missing values of the joint matrix.	Semantic Scholar
With the low-rank assumption of the constructed joint matrix, the missing labels can be recovered by minimizing its rank.	Semantic Scholar
Despite its success, most matrix completion based approaches ignore the smoothness assumption of unlabeled data, i.e., neighboring instances should also share a similar set of labels.	Semantic Scholar
Thus they may under exploit the intrinsic structures of data.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the matrix completion problem can be less efficient.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we propose to efficiently solve the multi-label learning problem as an enhanced matrix completion model with manifold regularization, where the graph Laplacian is used to ensure the label smoothness over it.	Semantic Scholar
To speed up the convergence of our model, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm, which solves the resulted nuclear norm minimization problem with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data have shown the promising results of the proposed approach.	Semantic Scholar
An institution typically comprises constitutive rules, which give shape and meaning to social interactions and regulative rules, which prescribe agent behaviour in the society.	Semantic Scholar
Regulative rules guide social interaction, in particular when they are coupled with reward and punishment regulations that are enforced for (non-)compliance.	Semantic Scholar
Institution examples include legislation and contracts.	Semantic Scholar
Formal institutional reasoning frameworks automate ascribing social meaning to agent interaction and determining whether those actions have social meanings that comprise (non-)compliant behaviour.	Semantic Scholar
Yet, institutions do not just govern societies.	Semantic Scholar
Rather, in what is called multi-level governance, institutional designs at lower governance levels (e.g., national legislation at the national level) are governed by higher level institutions (e.g., directives, human rights charters and supranational agreements).	Semantic Scholar
When an institution design is found to be non-compliant, punishments can be issued by annulling the legislation or imposing fines on the responsible designers (i.e., government).	Semantic Scholar
In order to enforce multi-level governance, higher governance levels (e.g., courts applying human rights) must check lower level institution designs (e.g., national legislation) for compliance; in order to avoid punishment, lower governance levels (e.g., national governments) must check their institution designs are compliant with higher-level institutions before enactment.	Semantic Scholar
However, checking non-compliance of institution designs in multi-level governance is non-trivial.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, because institutions in multi-level governance operate at different levels of abstraction.	Semantic Scholar
Lower level institutions govern with concrete regulations whilst higher level institutions typically comprise increasingly vague and abstract regulations.	Semantic Scholar
To address this issue, in this paper we propose a formal framework with a novel semantics that defines compliance between concrete lower level institutions and abstract higher level institutions.	Semantic Scholar
The formal framework is complemented by a sound and complete computational framework that automates compliance checking, which we apply to a real-world case study.	Semantic Scholar
Constraint Programming (CP) is a paradigm derived from artificial intelligence, operational research, and algorithmics that can be used to solve combinatorial problems.	Semantic Scholar
CP solves problems by interleaving search (assign a value to an unassigned variable) and propagation.	Semantic Scholar
Constraint propagation aims at removing/filtering inconsistent values from the domains of the variables in order to reduce the search space of the problem.	Semantic Scholar
In this thesis, we develop filtering algorithms for two complex combinatorial optimization problems: a Capacitated Lot Sizing Problem (CLSP) and the Constrained Arborescence Problem (CAP).	Semantic Scholar
Each of these problems has many variants and practical applications.	Semantic Scholar
The CLSP is the problem of finding an optimal production plan for single or multiple items while satisfying demands of clients and respecting resource restrictions.	Semantic Scholar
The CLSP finds important applications in production planning.	Semantic Scholar
In this thesis, we introduce a CLSP in CP.	Semantic Scholar
In many lot sizing and scheduling problems, in particular when the planning horizon is discrete and finite, there are stocking costs to be minimized.	Semantic Scholar
These costs depend on the time spent between the production of an order and its delivery.	Semantic Scholar
We focus on developing specialized filtering algorithms to handle the stocking cost part of a class of the CLSP.	Semantic Scholar
We propose the global optimization constraint StockingCost when the perperiod stocking cost is the same for all orders; and its generalized version, the IDStockingCost constraint (ID stands for Item Dependent).	Semantic Scholar
In this thesis, we also deal with a well-known problem in graph theory: the Minimum Weight Arborescence (MWA) problem.	Semantic Scholar
Consider a weighted directed graph in which we distinguish one vertex r as the root.	Semantic Scholar
An MWA rooted at r is a directed spanning tree rooted at r with minimum total weight.	Semantic Scholar
We focus on the CAP that requires one to find an arborescence that satisfies some side constraints (for example resource, degree, or diameter constraints) and that has minimum weight.	Semantic Scholar
The CAP has many real life applications in telecommunication networks, computer networks, transportation problems, scheduling problems, etc.	Semantic Scholar
After sensitivity analysis of the MWA, we introduce the CAP in CP.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a dedicated global optimization constraint to handle any known variant of the CAP in CP: the MinArborescence constraint.	Semantic Scholar
All the proposed filtering algorithms are analyzed theoretically and evaluated experimentally.	Semantic Scholar
The different experimental evaluations of these propagators against the state-of-the-art propagators show their respective efficiencies.	Semantic Scholar
This short paper develops an adaptive compensation control scheme for two physically linked two-wheel-drive mobile robots with multiple actuator faults.	Semantic Scholar
Kinematic and dynamic models are first proposed.	Semantic Scholar
Then, an adaptive control scheme is designed, which ensures system stability and asymptotic tracking properties.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation results verify its effectiveness.	Semantic Scholar
Robot-integrated microfluidic chip is a promising tool to realize mechanical characterization of a single cell with high throughput and high accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
The microfluidic chip used in our system has a pair of mechanical microprobes to measure deformation and reaction force of cells.	Semantic Scholar
In our previous studies, we measured the elasticity of cells in this measurement system.	Semantic Scholar
However, there were some problems on the measurement method limited in small deformation regions of cell.	Semantic Scholar
To avoid these problems, we changed the measurement method to utilize large deformation regions of cell.	Semantic Scholar
First, we proposed a differential-type sampling moiré method to extend the range of the force or displacement measurement.	Semantic Scholar
Second, the mechanical model of the cell was improved to express the deformation characteristics up to large deformation region.	Semantic Scholar
The deformation model was derived from high-molecular theory.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, the measured elasticity was related to the intracellular filament network.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, we accomplished in measuring the elasticity of the cells using the experimental data in a large deformation region.	Semantic Scholar
This study provided us with a more practical and reliable method to measure cellular elasticity.	Semantic Scholar
This paper deals with the problem on Lagrange α-exponential stability and α-exponential convergence for a class of fractional-order complex-valued neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, some new fractional-order differential inequalities are established, which improve and generalize previously known criteria.	Semantic Scholar
By using the new inequalities and coupling with the Lyapunov method, some effective criteria are derived to guarantee Lagrange α-exponential stability and α-exponential convergence of the addressed network.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the framework of the α-exponential convergence ball is also given, where the convergence rate is related to the parameters and the order of differential of the system.	Semantic Scholar
These results here, which the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium points need not to be considered, generalize and improve the earlier publications and can be applied to monostable and multistable fractional-order complex-valued neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, one example with numerical simulations is given to show the effectiveness of the obtained results.	Semantic Scholar
unknown	Semantic Scholar
In our previous work, we have studied a bipedal walking model with a torso, in which the gait evolves from the stable period-1 pattern directly into the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation pattern.	Semantic Scholar
Using the Ott-Grebogi-Yorke method, the bifurcation gait could be suppressed into the period-1 gait with higher energy efficiency and walking speed.	Semantic Scholar
However, the disturbance rejection ability of the obtained period-1 gait was insufficient, i.e., the basin of attraction was small.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a new suppression method based on the idea of model predictive control is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
Because of the design of the new walking model, which has a time window for computation, and the ability to calculate the walking map quickly, the optimal parameter perturbation can be generated in real time during walking.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, the suppression of the bifurcation gait for our bipedal robot can be achieved on-line.	Semantic Scholar
This new method not only makes the gait of the controlled model converge to the target period-1 gait with desired high performance, but also guarantees that the obtained gait is better able to reject disturbances.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a learning-based approach for impromptu trajectory tracking for non-minimum phase systems, i.e., systems with unstable inverse dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
Inversion-based feedforward approaches are commonly used for improving tracking performance; however, these approaches are not directly applicable to non-minimum phase systems due to their inherent instability.	Semantic Scholar
In order to resolve the instability issue, existing methods have assumed that the system model is known and used preactuation or inverse approximation techniques.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we propose an approach for learning a stable, approximate inverse of a non-minimum phase baseline system directly from its input–output data.	Semantic Scholar
Through theoretical discussions, simulations, and experiments on two different platforms, we show the stability of our proposed approach and its effectiveness for high-accuracy, impromptu tracking.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach also shows that including more information in the training, as is commonly assumed to be useful, does not lead to better performance but may trigger instability and impact the effectiveness of the overall approach.	Semantic Scholar
The traditional bag-of-words approach has found a wide range of applications in computer vision.	Semantic Scholar
The standard pipeline consists of a generation of a visual vocabulary, a quantization of the features into histograms of visual words, and a classification step for which usually a support vector machine in combination with a non-linear kernel is used.	Semantic Scholar
Given large amounts of data, however, the model suffers from a lack of discriminative power.	Semantic Scholar
This applies particularly for action recognition, where the vast amount of video features needs to be subsampled for unsupervised visual vocabulary generation.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the kernel computation can be very expensive on large datasets.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we propose a recurrent neural network that is equivalent to the traditional bag-of-words approach but enables for the application of discriminative training.	Semantic Scholar
The model further allows to incorporate the kernel computation into the neural network directly, solving the complexity issue and allowing to represent the complete classification system within a single network.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our method on four recent action recognition benchmarks and show that the conventional model as well as sparse coding methods are outperformed.	Semantic Scholar
Series elastic actuators (SEAs) are known to offer a range of advantages over stiff actuators for human–robot interaction, such as high force/torque fidelity, low impedance, and tolerance to shocks.	Semantic Scholar
While a variety of SEAs have been developed and implemented in initiatives that involve physical interactions with humans, relatively few control schemes were proposed to deal with the dynamic stability and uncertainties of robotic systems driven by SEAs, and the open issue of safety that resolves the conflicts of motion between the human and the robot has not been systematically addressed.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a novel continuous adaptive control method is proposed for SEA-driven robots used in human–robot interaction.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method provides a unified formulation for both the robot-in-charge  mode, where the robot plays a dominant role to follow a desired trajectory, and the human-in-charge  mode, in which the human plays a dominant role to guide the movement of robot.	Semantic Scholar
Instead of designing multiple controllers and switching between them, both typical modes are integrated into a single controller, and the transition between two modes is smooth and stable.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, the proposed controller is able to detect the human motion intention and guarantee the safe human–robot interaction.	Semantic Scholar
The dynamic stability of the closed-loop system is theoretically proven by using the Lyapunov method, with the consideration of uncertainties in both the robot dynamics and the actuator dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
Both simulation and experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed controller.	Semantic Scholar
We present a formalisation of the theory of finite fields, from basic axioms to their classification, both existence and uniqueness, in HOL4 using the notion of subfields.	Semantic Scholar
The tools developed are applied to the characterisation of subfields of finite fields, and to the cyclotomic factorisation of polynomials of the form , with coefficients over a finite fields.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose and experimentally verify a distributed formation control algorithm for a group of multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm brings the whole group of UAVs simultaneously to a prescribed submanifold that determines the formation shape in an asymptotically stable fashion in two- and three-dimensional environments.	Semantic Scholar
The complete distributed control framework is implemented with the combination of a fast model predictive control method executed at 50 Hz on low-power computers onboard multirotor UAVs and validated via a series of hardware-in-the-loop simulations and real-robot experiments.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments are configured to study the control performance in various formation cases of arbitrary time-varying (e.g., expanding, shrinking, or moving) shapes.	Semantic Scholar
In the actual experiments, up to four multirotors have been implemented to form arbitrary triangular, rectangular, and circular shapes drawn by the operator via a human–robot interaction device.	Semantic Scholar
We also carry out hardware-in-the-loop simulations using up to six onboard computers to achieve spherical formations and a formation moving through obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
Learning in physical neural systems must rely on learning rules that are local in both space and time.	Semantic Scholar
Optimal learning in deep neural architectures requires that non-local information be available to the deep synapses.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, in general, optimal learning in physical neural systems requires the presence of a deep learning channel to communicate non-local information to deep synapses, in a direction opposite to the forward propagation of the activities.	Semantic Scholar
Theoretical arguments suggest that for circular autoencoders, an important class of neural architectures where the output layer is identical to the input layer, alternative algorithms may exist that enable local learning without the need for additional learning channels, by using the forward activation channel as the deep learning channel.	Semantic Scholar
Here we systematically identify, classify, and study several such local learning algorithms, based on the general idea of recirculating information from the output layer to the hidden layers.	Semantic Scholar
We show through simulations and mathematical derivations that these algorithms are robust and converge to critical points of the global error function.	Semantic Scholar
In most cases, we show that these recirculation algorithms are very similar to an adaptive form of random backpropagation, where each hidden layer receives a linearly transformed, slowly-varying, version of the output error.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, without separating the complex-valued neural networks into two real-valued systems, the quasi-projective synchronization of fractional-order complex-valued neural networks is investigated.	Semantic Scholar
First, two new fractional-order inequalities are established by using the theory of complex functions, Laplace transform and Mittag-Leffler functions, which generalize traditional inequalities with the first-order derivative in the real domain.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, different from hybrid control schemes given in the previous work concerning the projective synchronization, a simple and linear control strategy is designed in this paper and several criteria are derived to ensure quasi-projective synchronization of the complex-valued neural networks with fractional-order based on the established fractional-order inequalities and the theory of complex functions.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the error bounds of quasi-projective synchronization are estimated.	Semantic Scholar
Especially, some conditions are also presented for the Mittag-Leffler synchronization of the addressed neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, some numerical examples with simulations are provided to show the effectiveness of the derived theoretical results.	Semantic Scholar
unknown	Semantic Scholar
To understand neural activity, two broad categories of models exist: statistical and dynamical.	Semantic Scholar
While statistical models possess rigorous methods for parameter estimation and goodness-of-fit assessment, dynamical models provide mechanistic insight.	Semantic Scholar
In general, these two categories of models are separately applied; understanding the relationships between these modeling approaches remains an area of active research.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we examine this relationship using simulation.	Semantic Scholar
To do so, we first generate spike train data from a well-known dynamical model, the Izhikevich neuron, with a noisy input current.	Semantic Scholar
We then fit these spike train data with a statistical model (a generalized linear model, GLM, with multiplicative influences of past spiking).	Semantic Scholar
For different levels of noise, we show how the GLM captures both the deterministic features of the Izhikevich neuron and the variability driven by the noise.	Semantic Scholar
We conclude that the GLM captures essential features of the simulated spike trains, but for near-deterministic spike trains, goodness-of-fit analyses reveal that the model does not fit very well in a statistical sense; the essential random part of the GLM is not captured.	Semantic Scholar
In industrial scenarios, requiring human–robot collaboration, the understanding between the human operator and his/her robot coworker is paramount.	Semantic Scholar
On the one side, the robot has to detect human intentions, and on the other side, the human needs to be aware of what is happening during the collaborative task.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we address the first issue by predicting human behavior through a new recursive Bayesian classifier, exploiting head, and hand tracking data.	Semantic Scholar
Human awareness is tackled by endowing the human with a vibrotactile ring that sends acknowledgments to the user during critical phases of the collaborative task.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed solution has been assessed in a human–robot collaboration scenario, and we found that adding haptic feedback is particularly helpful to improve the performance when the human–robot cooperation task is performed by nonskilled subjects.	Semantic Scholar
We believe that predicting operator's intention and equipping him/her with wearable interface, able to give information about the prediction reliability, are essential features to improve performance in a human–robot collaboration in industrial environments.	Semantic Scholar
We used the phase-resetting method to study a biologically relevant three-neuron network in which one neuron receives multiple inputs per cycle.	Semantic Scholar
For this purpose, we first generalized the concept of phase resetting to accommodate multiple inputs per cycle.	Semantic Scholar
We explicitly showed how analytical conditions for the existence and the stability of phase-locked modes are derived.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we solved newly derived recursive maps using as an example a biologically relevant driving-driven neural network with a dynamic feedback loop.	Semantic Scholar
We applied the generalized phase-resetting definition to predict the relative-phase and the stability of a phase-locked mode in open loop setup.	Semantic Scholar
We also compared the predicted phase-locked mode against numerical simulations of the fully connected network.	Semantic Scholar
The increasing use of active front steering (AFS) technology for obstacle avoidance raises the question of drivers’ interaction with vehicle automation.	Semantic Scholar
Mathematical models capable of representing such interaction are in demand for driver behavior study.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents the application of open-loop Stackelberg equilibrium to modeling a driver's interaction with vehicle AFS control in an obstacle avoidance scenario, where both the driver and the AFS controller are exerting steering control to the vehicle.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, such driver–AFS interactive steering control is modeled as a leader–follower game.	Semantic Scholar
Mathematical expressions of the driver's and the AFS controller's steering control strategies are derived using the linear quadratic dynamic optimization approach and the distributed model predictive control (DMPC) approach.	Semantic Scholar
These two approaches are found to give identical control gains, which suggest their equivalence in representing driver–AFS interaction.	Semantic Scholar
The DMPC approach is found to consume far less computation time due to its numerical nature.	Semantic Scholar
Mathematical modifications to the steering control strategies are then introduced to allow practical implementation for a future experimental study.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation results including time histories of steering angles and vehicle responses are illustrated and discussed.	Semantic Scholar
The stabilization of man-made dynamic systems has been achieved by sensor-based state feedback control with high computational bandwidth, fast signal transmission speed, and stiff joints.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast, many biological systems can achieve similar or superior stable behavior with low computational bandwidth, slow signal transmission speed via the nervous system, and flexible joints.	Semantic Scholar
The concept of self-stabilization has recently been proposed and widely investigated to explain this phenomenon.	Semantic Scholar
Self-stabilization is defined as the ability to restore its original state after a disturbance without any feedback control.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, the stabilizing function of a musculoskeletal system for arbitrary motion in the vertical plane is analytically investigated using Lyapunov stability criteria.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this investigation, the method of designing a new actuator that can assign a self-stabilizing function to a robotic arm is introduced and a self-stabilizing manipulator is physically realized.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, a theoretically predicted self-stabilizing function is experimentally verified and explains why a biological musculoskeletal system can be stabilized with feedforward control.	Semantic Scholar
Most Non-Rigid Structure from Motion (NRSfM) solutions are based on factorization approaches that allow reconstructing objects parameterized by a sparse set of 3D points.	Semantic Scholar
These solutions, however, are low resolution and generally, they do not scale well to more than a few tens of points.	Semantic Scholar
While there have been recent attempts at bringing NRSfM to a dense domain, using for instance variational formulations, these are computationally demanding alternatives which require certain spatial continuity of the data, preventing their use for articulated shapes with large deformations or situations with multiple discontinuous objects.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose incorporating existing point trajectory low-rank models into a probabilistic framework for matrix normal distributions.	Semantic Scholar
With this formalism, we can then simultaneously learn shape and pose parameters using expectation maximization, and easily exploit additional priors such as known point correlations.	Semantic Scholar
While similar frameworks have been used before to model distributions over shapes, here we show that formulating the problem in terms of distributions over trajectories brings remarkable improvements, especially in generality and efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate the proposed approach in a variety of scenarios including one or multiple objects, sparse or dense reconstructions, missing observations, mild or sharp deformations, and in all cases, with minimal prior knowledge and low computational cost.	Semantic Scholar
We formulate an equivalence between machine learning and the formulation of statistical data assimilation as used widely in physical and biological sciences.	Semantic Scholar
The correspondence is that layer number in a feedforward artificial network setting is the analog of time in the data assimilation setting.	Semantic Scholar
This connection has been noted in the machine learning literature.	Semantic Scholar
We add a perspective that expands on how methods from statistical physics and aspects of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics play a role in how networks can be trained and designed.	Semantic Scholar
Within the discussion of this equivalence, we show that adding more layers (making the network deeper) is analogous to adding temporal resolution in a data assimilation framework.	Semantic Scholar
Extending this equivalence to recurrent networks is also discussed.	Semantic Scholar
We explore how one can find a candidate for the global minimum of the cost functions in the machine learning context using a method from data assimilation.	Semantic Scholar
Calculations on simple models from both sides of the equivalence are reported.	Semantic Scholar
Also discussed is a framework in which the time or layer label is taken to be continuous, providing a differential equation, the Euler-Lagrange equation and its boundary conditions, as a necessary condition for a minimum of the cost function.	Semantic Scholar
This shows that the problem being solved is a two-point boundary value problem familiar in the discussion of variational methods.	Semantic Scholar
The use of continuous layers is denoted “deepest learning.” These problems respect a symplectic symmetry in continuous layer phase space.	Semantic Scholar
Both Lagrangian versions and Hamiltonian versions of these problems are presented.	Semantic Scholar
Their well-studied implementation in a discrete time/layer, while respecting the symplectic structure, is addressed.	Semantic Scholar
The Hamiltonian version provides a direct rationale for backpropagation as a solution method for a certain two-point boundary value problem.	Semantic Scholar
As real industrial processes have measurement samples with noises of different statistical characteristics and obtain the sample one by one usually, on-line sequential learning algorithms which can achieve better learning performance for systems with noises of various statistics are necessary.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a new online Extreme Learning Machine (ELM, of Huang et al.)	Semantic Scholar
algorithm, namely recursive least mean p-power ELM (RLMP-ELM).	Semantic Scholar
In RLMP-ELM, a novel error criterion for cost function, namely the least mean p-power (LMP) error criterion, provides a mechanism to update the output weights sequentially.	Semantic Scholar
The LMP error criterion aims to minimize the mean p-power of the error that is the generalization of the mean square error criterion used in the ELM.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed on-line learning algorithm is able to provide on-line predictions of variables with noises of different statistics and obtains better performance than ELM and online sequential ELM (OS-ELM) while the non-Gaussian noises impact the processes.	Semantic Scholar
Simulations are reported to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed methods.	Semantic Scholar
Modeling discrete optimization problems is not straightforward.	Semantic Scholar
It is often the case that precompiling a subproblem that involves only a few tightly constrained variables as a table constraint can improve solving time.	Semantic Scholar
Nevertheless, enumerating all the solutions of a subproblem into a table can be costly in time and space.	Semantic Scholar
In this work we propose using Multivalued Decision Diagrams (MDDs) and formulas in Deterministic Decomposable Negation Normal Form (d-DNNFs) rather than tables to compute and store all solutions of a subproblem.	Semantic Scholar
This, in turn, can be used to enhance the solver thanks to stronger propagation via specific propagators for these structures.	Semantic Scholar
We show how to precompile part of a problem into both these structures, which can then be injected back in the model by substituting the constraints it encodes, or simply adding it as a redundant constraint.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, in the case of MDDs, they can also be used to create edge-valued MDDs for optimization problems with an appropriate form.	Semantic Scholar
From our experiments we conclude that all three techniques are valuable in their own right, and show when each one should be chosen over the others.	Semantic Scholar
Least squares regression (LSR) is a fundamental statistical analysis technique that has been widely applied to feature learning.	Semantic Scholar
However, limited by its simplicity, the local structure of data is easy to neglect, and many methods have considered using orthogonal constraint for preserving more local information.	Semantic Scholar
Another major drawback of LSR is that the loss function between soft regression results and hard target values cannot precisely reflect the classification ability; thus, the idea of the large margin constraint is put forward.	Semantic Scholar
As a consequence, we pay attention to the concepts of large margin and orthogonal constraint to propose a novel algorithm, orthogonal least squares regression with large margin (OLSLM), for multiclass classification in this letter.	Semantic Scholar
The core task of this algorithm is to learn regression targets from data and an orthogonal transformation matrix simultaneously such that the proposed model not only ensures every data point can be correctly classified with a large margin than conventional least squares regression, but also can preserve more local data structure information in the subspace.	Semantic Scholar
Our efficient optimization method for solving the large margin constraint and orthogonal constraint iteratively proved to be convergent in both theory and practice.	Semantic Scholar
We also apply the large margin constraint in the process of generating a sparse learning model for feature selection via joint ℓ2,1-norm minimization on both loss function and regularization terms.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results validate that our method performs better than state-of-the-art methods on various real-world data sets.	Semantic Scholar
A query facet is a significant list of information nuggets that explains an underlying aspect of a query.	Semantic Scholar
Existing algorithms mine facets of a query by extracting frequent lists contained in top search results.	Semantic Scholar
The coverage of facets and facet items mined by these kind of methods might be limited, because only a small number of search results are used.	Semantic Scholar
In order to solve this problem, we propose mining query facets by using knowledge bases which contain high-quality structured data.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we first generate facets based on the properties of the entities which are contained in Freebase and correspond to the query.	Semantic Scholar
Second, we mine initial query facets from search results, then expanding them by finding similar entities from Freebase.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that our proposed method can significantly improve the coverage of facet items over the state-of-the-art algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Analyzing the polarimetric properties of reflected light is a potential source of shape information.	Semantic Scholar
However, it is well-known that polarimetric information contains fundamental shape ambiguities, leading to an underconstrained problem of recovering 3D geometry.	Semantic Scholar
To address this problem, we use additional geometric information, from coarse depth maps, to constrain the shape information from polarization cues.	Semantic Scholar
Our main contribution is a framework that combines surface normals from polarization (hereafter polarization normals) with an aligned depth map.	Semantic Scholar
The additional geometric constraints are used to mitigate physics-based artifacts, such as azimuthal ambiguity, refractive distortion and fronto-parallel signal degradation.	Semantic Scholar
We believe our work may have practical implications for optical engineering, demonstrating a new option for state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a new method for guaranteed integration of state equations.	Semantic Scholar
Within this framework, the variables of interest are trajectories submitted to both arithmetic and differential equations.	Semantic Scholar
The approach consists in formalizing a problem thanks to a constraint network and then apply these constraints to sets of trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
The contribution of the paper is to provide a reliable framework to enclose the solutions of these differential equations.	Semantic Scholar
Its use is shown to be simple, more general and more competitive than existing approaches dealing with guaranteed integration, especially when applied to mobile robotics.	Semantic Scholar
The flexibility of the developed framework allows to deal with non-linear differential equations or even differential inclusions built from datasets, while considering observations of the states of interest.	Semantic Scholar
An illustration of this method is given over several examples with mobile robots.	Semantic Scholar
High dimensional data analysis gives rise to many challenges.	Semantic Scholar
One such that has come to gain a lot of attention recently is the concentration of distances (CoD) phenomenon, which is the inability of distance functions to distinguish points well in high dimensions.	Semantic Scholar
CoD affects almost every machine learning and data analysis algorithm in high dimensions.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we present a novel efficient and effective empirical index that not only illustrates whether a distance function tends to concentrate for a given data set, but also enables us to measure the rate of concentration and allows us to compare different distance functions vis-á-vis their rate of concentration.	Semantic Scholar
As opposed to existing empirical indices, the proposed empirical measure uses only the internal characteristics of a given data set and hence is applicable on real data sets, which was hitherto not possible.	Semantic Scholar
Evolutionary Robotics (ER) is a field of study that has shown much promise in automating the development of robotic controllers and morphologies.	Semantic Scholar
The use of simulators as an alternative to real-world robots is often employed to reduce the time required to develop effective controllers in the ER process.	Semantic Scholar
However, the development of adequate simulators is often time-consuming and complex.	Semantic Scholar
Simulators are usually constructed from physics models and/or are based on empirically collected data.	Semantic Scholar
The vast majority of simulation approaches are based on physics models which can become complex and require specialised knowledge.	Semantic Scholar
Alternative simulation approaches that simplify and automate the modelling of real-world phenomena can provide certain advantages over traditional approaches.	Semantic Scholar
An alternative simulation approach, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) that model the real-world phenomena based on empirical data are relatively simple to construct and requires little specialised knowledge.	Semantic Scholar
ANN-based simulators are traditionally constructed before the ER process can begin and require the sampling of real-world experimental data.	Semantic Scholar
Disadvantages to the traditional approach to ANNbased simulator construction are that the simulator must be created before the ER process can be initiated and a large amount of behavioural data must be collected Email addresses: grant.woodford@nmmu.ac.za (Grant W.

The viability of the concurrent approach was demonstrated on a real-world snake-like robot by performing trajectory planning tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Influential factors related to the success of the concurrent approach were also studied by investigating the effects various parameter settings had on success.	Semantic Scholar

The problem of generating smooth parallel parking maneuver for autonomous car-like vehicles is considered, wherein the vehicle moves forward from the starting point to an intermediate point and then traces a path backward to the parking position.	Semantic Scholar
Any error in accurately reaching the intermediate point leads to maneuver replanning and hence puts extra computational burden on the planner.	Semantic Scholar
Addressing the issue, this letter formulates the problem in a point-to-ray framework connecting the parking position to all points in a neighborhood of the intermediate point.	Semantic Scholar
Exploiting its asymptotic convergence, four parameter logistic (4PL) curve based S-shaped path is proposed as a solution with a single maneuver connecting the intermediate point neighborhood to the parking position.	Semantic Scholar
Inherent to the 4PL curve, the maneuver presents a continuous steering profile with zero steering angle at the ends.	Semantic Scholar
Parking slot collision avoidance and steering limit of the vehicle are satisfied by deducing closed-form analytic conditions on the two design parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Together with the robustness to intermediate point variation, comparison with existing approaches highlights computational and design advantages.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach is validated using a double-tracked Ackermann steering vehicle model.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a directional antenna-based leader-follower robotic relay system capable of building end-toend communication in complicated and dynamically changing environments.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed system consists of multiple networked robots one is a mobile end node and the others are leaders or followers acting as radio relays.	Semantic Scholar
Every follower uses directional antennas to relay a communication radio and to estimate the location of the leader robot as a sensory device.	Semantic Scholar
For bearing estimation, we employ a weight centroid algorithm (WCA) and present a theoretical analysis of the use of WCA for this work.	Semantic Scholar
Using a robotic convoy method, we develop online, distributed control strategies that satisfy the scalability requirements of robotic network systems and enable cooperating robots to work independently.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of the proposed system is evaluated by conducting extensive real-world experiments that successfully build actual communication between two end nodes.	Semantic Scholar
Learning from label proportions (LLP), in which the training data is in the form of bags and only the proportion of each class in each bag is available, has attracted wide interest in machine learning.	Semantic Scholar
However, how to solve high-dimensional LLP problem is still a challenging task.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called learning from label proportions based on random forests (LLP-RF), which has the advantage of dealing with high-dimensional LLP problem.	Semantic Scholar
First, by defining the hidden class labels inside target bags as random variables, we formulate a robust loss function based on random forests and take the corresponding proportion information into LLP-RF by penalizing the difference between the ground truth and estimated label proportion.	Semantic Scholar
Second, a simple but efficient alternating annealing method is employed to solve the corresponding optimization model.	Semantic Scholar
At last, various experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can obtain the best accuracies on high-dimensional data compared with several recently developed methods.	Semantic Scholar
Today, modeling and subsequent digital model representations are essential constituents in collaborative endeavors on organizational change.	Semantic Scholar
Once created, models need to be digitized for shared stakeholder understanding and further processing.	Semantic Scholar
Whenever paper serves as carrier medium, it is likely to disrupt further processing, elicitation, and modeling.	Semantic Scholar
While digital environments support transformation processes in collaborative modeling from its very beginning, the necessary technical infrastructure still might hamper situated capturing of models.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, this contribution aims to reduce the need for sophisticated technical components by enabling stakeholders to capture their paper-based models in a situation-sensitive way.	Semantic Scholar
We present a system that enables capturing paper-based models with mundane technical means by end users under uncontrolled conditions.	Semantic Scholar
We describe the components developed for recognition of these models and embed it in a mixed-modality workflow supported by a tabletop interfacing a web platform for further processing.	Semantic Scholar
As our empirical evidence demonstrates, this approach enables both situated and error-tolerant capturing of hand-drawn conceptual models by individual users.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, it can be integrated with more sophisticated IT-based modeling tools for further digital processing.	Semantic Scholar

The minimal SMCS contains much fewer nodes than its maximum counterpart, and is thus easier to be understood.	Semantic Scholar
However, the minimal SMCS can be costly to evaluate.	Semantic Scholar
We thus propose efficient Expand-Refine algorithms, as well as their approximate versions with accuracy guarantees.	Semantic Scholar

We address the challenging problem of robotic grasping and manipulation in the presence of uncertainty.	Semantic Scholar
This uncertainty is due to noisy sensing, inaccurate models, and hard-to-predict environment dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
We quantify the importance of continuous, real-time perception and its tight integration with reactive motion generation methods in dynamic manipulation scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
We compare three different systems that are instantiations of the most common architectures in the field: 1) a traditional sense-plan-act approach that is still widely used; 2) a myopic controller that only reacts to local environment dynamics; and 3) a reactive planner that integrates feedback control and motion optimization.	Semantic Scholar
All architectures rely on the same components for real-time perception and reactive motion generation to allow a quantitative evaluation.	Semantic Scholar
We extensively evaluate the systems on a real robotic platform in four scenarios that exhibit either a challenging workspace geometry or a dynamic environment.	Semantic Scholar
We quantify the robustness and accuracy that is due to integrating real-time feedback at different time scales in a reactive motion generation system.	Semantic Scholar

As the proliferation of geo-social networks, location-aware promotion is becoming more necessary in real applications.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study the distance-aware influence maximization (DAIM) problem, which advocates the importance of the distance between users and the promoted location.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike the traditional influence maximization problem, DAIM treats users differently based on their distances from the promoted location.	Semantic Scholar

In order to handle the large number of queries and meet the online requirement, we develop two novel index-based approaches, MIA-DA and RIS-DA, by utilizing the information over some pre-sampled query locations.	Semantic Scholar
MIA-DA is a heuristic method which adopts the maximum influence arborescence (MIA) model to approximate the influence calculation.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, different pruning strategies as well as a priority-based algorithm are proposed to significantly reduce the searching space.	Semantic Scholar
To improve the effectiveness, in RIS-DA, we extend the reverse influence sampling (RIS) model and come up with an unbiased estimator for the DAIM problem.	Semantic Scholar

Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of proposed methods over real geo-social networks.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a framework to generate static robot configurations satisfying a set of physical and geometrical constraints.	Semantic Scholar
This is done by formulating nonlinear constrained optimization problems over non-Euclidean manifolds and solving them.	Semantic Scholar
To do so, we present a new sequential quadratic programming solver working natively on general manifolds and propose an interface to easily formulate the problems, with the tedious and error-prone work automated for the user.	Semantic Scholar
We also introduce several new types of constraints for having more complex contacts or working on forces/torques.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach allows an elegant mathematical description of the constraints and we exemplify it through formulation and computation examples in complex scenarios with humanoid robots.	Semantic Scholar
Raw visual data used to train classifiers is abundant and easy to gather, but lacks semantic labels that describe visual concepts of interest.	Semantic Scholar
These labels are necessary for supervised learning and can require significant human effort to collect.	Semantic Scholar
We discuss four labeling objectives that play an important role in the design of frameworks aimed at collecting label information for large training sets while maintaining low human effort: discovery, efficiency, exploitation and accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce a framework that explicitly models and balances these four labeling objectives with the use of (1) hierarchical clustering, (2) a novel interestingness measure that defines structural change within the hierarchy, and (3) an iterative group-based labeling process that exploits relationships between labeled and unlabeled data.	Semantic Scholar
Results on benchmark data show that our framework collects labeled training data more efficiently than existing labeling techniques and trains higher performing visual classifiers.	Semantic Scholar
Further, we show that our resulting framework is fast and significantly reduces human interaction time when labeling real-world multi-concept imagery depicting outdoor environments.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the nonholonomic constraints as well as the constraints on torque and power resources, it is challenging to design a controller to asymptotically stabilize a nonholonomic robot at a predefined pose.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a switched controller is introduced for the asymptotic stabilization of nonholonomic robots using singularity, which is deemed undesirable due to loss of controllability.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed controller is inspired by a new insight on the singularity set of the nonholonomic robot, i.e., the singularity set includes a subset that can be asymptotically stabilized.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed controller is applicable to chained form systems that make an important class of drift-less nonholonomic systems, especially for those robots with a differential-drive mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
Considering its simplicity and efficiency, our method has the potential to be used in practice.	Semantic Scholar

Home energy savings via eco-feedback is often considered a serious, tedious, or even distracting task due to the need for frequent human intervention.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, most existing eco-feedback systems focus on providing energy usage information and ignore the users’ contexts.	Semantic Scholar
This may render the systems incapable of capturing the users’ changes when proenvironmental behaviors have been encouraged.	Semantic Scholar
To address this, our study leverages Internet of Things (IoT) enabled technologies to realize an adaptive, context-aware, and playful cyber-physical system (CPS) for everyday energy savings with the hope of facilitating collaboration between a person and a smart energy-saving (ES) system to the greatest extent possible.	Semantic Scholar
To leverage the benefits inherent in a CPS, bidirectionally interactive information visualization integrated with pet-raising gamification was incorporated into the adaptive CPS.	Semantic Scholar
This synchronized the information from the user's physical environment with its counterpart in the pet's virtual environment.	Semantic Scholar
In order to provide flexible services, all IoT devices were agentized to form reconfigurable agents.	Semantic Scholar
In our experimental evaluation, this bidirectional mapping empowered users to flexibly control remote appliances anywhere and anytime in a more natural way, which enabled users to embed interactions with the ES CPS into their daily routine.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, improvements to system adaptability (33% in precision; 21% in recall) along with the reconfigurable ES services (additionally saving energy about 16.21%) show the potential of the CPS to enhance the users’ experience and prolong the users' engagement in everyday energy savings.

Virtual environments (VEs) grant the ability to experience real-world scenarios, such as driving, in a virtual, safe, and reproducible context.	Semantic Scholar
However, in order to achieve their full potential, the fidelity of the VE must provide confidence that it replicates the perception of the real-world experience.	Semantic Scholar
The computational cost of simulating real-world visuals accurately means that compromises to the fidelity of the visuals must be made.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a subjective evaluation of driving in a VE at different quality settings is presented.	Semantic Scholar
Participants (n = 44) were driven around in the real world and in a purposely built representative VE and the fidelity of the graphics and overall experience at low-, medium-, and high-visual settings were analyzed.	Semantic Scholar
Low quality corresponds to the illumination in many current traditional simulators, medium to a higher quality using accurate shadows and reflections, and high to the quality experienced in modern movies and simulations that require hours of computation.	Semantic Scholar
Results demonstrate that graphics quality affects the perceived fidelity of the visuals and the overall experience.	Semantic Scholar
When judging the overall experience, participants could tell the difference between the lower quality graphics and the rest but did not significantly discriminate between the medium and higher graphical settings.	Semantic Scholar
This indicates that future driving simulators should improve the quality, but once the equivalent of the presented medium quality is reached, they may not need to do so significantly.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a novel cascade state estimation framework for the three-dimensional (3-D) center of mass (CoM) estimation of walking humanoid robots.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed framework, called State Estimation RObot Walking (SEROW), fuses effectively joint encoder, inertial, feet pressure, and visual odometry measurements.	Semantic Scholar
Initially, we consider the humanoid's Newton–Euler dynamics and rigorously derive the nonlinear CoM estimator.	Semantic Scholar
The latter accurately estimates the 3D-CoM position, velocity, and external forces acting on the CoM, while directly considering the presence of uneven terrain and the body's angular momentum rate and, thus, effectively coupling the frontal with the lateral plane dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we extend an established floating mass estimator to take into account the support foot pose, yielding in such a way the mandatory, for CoM estimation, affine transformations and forming a cascade state estimation scheme.	Semantic Scholar
Subsequently, we quantitatively and qualitatively assess the proposed scheme by comparing it to other estimation structures in terms of accuracy and robustness to disturbances, both in simulation and on an actual NAO robot walking outdoors over an inclined terrain.	Semantic Scholar
To facilitate further research endeavors, our implementation is offered as an open-source ROS/C++ package.	Semantic Scholar
Spiking neural networks (SNN) are the third generation of artificial neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
SNN are the closest approximation to biological neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
SNNs make use of temporal spike trains to command inputs and outputs, allowing a faster and more complex computation.	Semantic Scholar
As demonstrated by biological organisms, they are a potentially good approach to designing controllers for highly nonlinear dynamic systems in which the performance of controllers developed by conventional techniques is not satisfactory or difficult to implement.	Semantic Scholar
SNN-based controllers exploit their ability for online learning and self-adaptation to evolve when transferred from simulations to the real world.	Semantic Scholar
SNN's inherent binary and temporary way of information codification facilitates their hardware implementation compared to analog neurons.	Semantic Scholar
Biological neural networks often require a lower number of neurons compared to other controllers based on artificial neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, these neuronal systems are imitated to perform the control of non-linear dynamic systems.	Semantic Scholar
For this purpose, a control structure based on spiking neural networks has been designed.	Semantic Scholar
Particular attention has been paid to optimizing the structure and size of the neural network.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed structure is able to control dynamic systems with a reduced number of neurons and connections.	Semantic Scholar
A supervised learning process using evolutionary algorithms has been carried out to perform controller training.	Semantic Scholar
The efficiency of the proposed network has been verified in two examples of dynamic systems control.	Semantic Scholar
Simulations show that the proposed control based on SNN exhibits superior performance compared to other approaches based on Neural Networks and SNNs.	Semantic Scholar
In an attempt to improve the forecasting accuracy of stock price fluctuations, a new one-step-ahead model is developed in this paper which combines empirical mode decomposition (EMD) with stochastic time strength neural network (STNN).	Semantic Scholar
The EMD is a processing technique introduced to extract all the oscillatory modes embedded in a series, and the STNN model is established for considering the weight of occurrence time of the historical data.	Semantic Scholar
The linear regression performs the predictive availability of the proposed model, and the effectiveness of EMD-STNN is revealed clearly through comparing the predicted results with the traditional models.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, a new evaluated method (q-order multiscale complexity invariant distance) is applied to measure the predicted results of real stock index series, and the empirical results show that the proposed model indeed displays a good performance in forecasting stock market fluctuations.

We present numerical tools for the efficient solution of this optimization problem.	Semantic Scholar
The method is experimentally assessed on new datasets of both synthetic and real point clouds, and is additionally compared to two recent works on object replacement on data from the corresponding papers.	Semantic Scholar
In order to achieve high-speed flight of a damaged quadrotor with complete loss of a single rotor, a multiloop hybrid nonlinear controller is designed.	Semantic Scholar
By fully making use of sensor measurements, the model dependence of this control method is reduced, which is conducive to handling disturbance from the unknown aerodynamic effects.	Semantic Scholar
This controller is tested on a quadrotor vehicle with one rotor completely removed in the high-speed condition.	Semantic Scholar
Free flights are performed in the Open Jet Facility, a large-scale wind tunnel.	Semantic Scholar
Over 9 m/s flight speed is reached for the damaged quadrotor in these tests.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, several high-speed spin-induced aerodynamic effects are discovered and analyzed.	Semantic Scholar
Learning curves of simple perceptron were derived here.	Semantic Scholar
The learning curve of the perceptron learning with noisy teacher was shown to be non-monotonic, which has never appeared even though the learning curves have been analyzed for half a century.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we showed how this phenomenon occurs by analyzing the asymptotic property of the perceptron learning using a method in systems science, that is, calculating the eigenvalues of the system matrix and the corresponding eigenvectors.	Semantic Scholar
We also analyzed the AdaTron learning and the Hebbian learning in the same way and found that the learning curve of the AdaTron learning is non-monotonic whereas that of the Hebbian learning is monotonic.	Semantic Scholar
Electromagnetic formation flight (EMFF) denotes a method of formation flight control in which a cluster of spacecraft are equipped with controllable magnetic dipoles for coordination of their relative positions using interdipole forces.	Semantic Scholar
We present a method for finding a minimum-power dipole solution for a given set of desired interdipole forces.	Semantic Scholar
We approach this nonlinear constrained optimization problem using sequential quadratic programming, which requires a Jacobian relating changes in the dipoles to changes in forces, as well as the gradient and Hessian of a Lagrangian function.	Semantic Scholar
We derive compact analytic solutions for all three of these quantities, using linear-algebraic representations and vector calculus, which can be implemented numerically with a small set of simple functions.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach does not rely on arbitrary parameterizations as have prior approaches, and the structure enables further analysis of numerical conditioning and convergence.	Semantic Scholar
We conduct numerical simulations, using a number of configurations relevant to EMFF, to verify the method and characterize its performance when numerical routines are randomly initialized, which can serve as a benchmark against which future improvements can be quantified.	Semantic Scholar
The method presented may have other uses beyond EMFF, including being applied to new classes of modular magnetic systems.	Semantic Scholar

Studies in psychology have shown that the dynamics of emotional expressions play an important role in face emotion recognition in humans.	Semantic Scholar
Motivated by these studies, in this paper the dynamics of face expressions are modeled and used for automatic emotion recognition and pain detection.	Semantic Scholar
Given a temporal sequence of face images, several appearance-based descriptors are computed at each frame.	Semantic Scholar
Over the sequence, the descriptors corresponding to the same feature type and spatial scale define a time series.	Semantic Scholar
The Hankel matrix built upon each time series is used to represent the dynamics of face expressions with respect to the used feature-scale pair.	Semantic Scholar
The set of Hankel matrices obtained by varying the feature type and the scale is used within a boosting approach to train a strong classifier.	Semantic Scholar
During training, random subspace projection is adopted for feature and scale selection.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on two challenging publicly available datasets show that the dynamics of appearance-based face expression representations can be used to discriminate among different emotion classes and, within a boosting approach, attain state-of-the-art average accuracy values in classification.

We present an investigation of the potential use of Hopfield networks to learn neurally plausible, distributed representations of category prototypes.	Semantic Scholar
Hopfield networks are dynamical models of autoassociative memory which learn to recreate a set of input states from any given starting state.	Semantic Scholar
These networks, however, will almost always learn states which were not presented during training, so called spurious states.	Semantic Scholar
Historically, spurious states have been an undesirable side-effect of training a Hopfield network and there has been much research into detecting and discarding these unwanted states.	Semantic Scholar
However, we suggest that some of these states may represent useful information, namely states which represent prototypes of the categories instantiated in the network's training data.	Semantic Scholar
It would be desirable for a memory system trained on multiple instance tokens of a category to extract a representation of the category prototype.	Semantic Scholar
We present an investigation showing that Hopfield networks are in fact capable of learning category prototypes as strong, stable, attractors without being explicitly trained on them.	Semantic Scholar
We also expand on previous research into the detection of spurious states in order to show that it is possible to distinguish between trained, spurious, and prototypical attractors.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents an effective solution for 3D urban map generation using aerial images as prior information for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).	Semantic Scholar
The research targets urban canyons where Global Positioning System (GPS) signals are highly sporadic and erroneous.	Semantic Scholar
As a solution for urban canyon mapping, this study proposes aerial image-based heading correction and kinematics considered odometry modeling.	Semantic Scholar
Aerial images often suffer from being significantly askew due to the height of structures and viewpoint changes, preventing direct integration with SLAM.	Semantic Scholar
However, we found that the direction of the structural edges was still valid, despite slanted building images.	Semantic Scholar
Making use of this property, this letter proposes a heading correction method using aerial images.	Semantic Scholar
As heading error is a critical factor in SLAM when mapping large areas, the proposed heading correction method substantially reduces estimation errors.	Semantic Scholar
Aiming for large urban area mapping, this letter also focuses on sensor modeling for odometry and GPS data.	Semantic Scholar
In odometry generation, mobile robot kinematics is considered by incorporating wheel diameter and base distance uncertainties into odometry covariance modeling.	Semantic Scholar
Results are presented from various types of urban areas over a path 28 km in length.	Semantic Scholar
For thorough validation, we ran the algorithm on three urban areas with differing degrees of GPS availability and structural complexity: a downtown area with medium complexity, a building complex, and the downtown area of a large city.	Semantic Scholar

In recent years, neural networks have enjoyed a renaissance as function approximators in reinforcement learning.	Semantic Scholar
Two decades after Tesauro's TD-Gammon achieved near top-level human performance in backgammon, the deep reinforcement learning algorithm DQN achieved human-level performance in many Atari 2600 games.	Semantic Scholar
The purpose of this study is twofold.	Semantic Scholar
First, we propose two activation functions for neural network function approximation in reinforcement learning: the sigmoid-weighted linear unit (SiLU) and its derivative function (dSiLU).	Semantic Scholar
The activation of the SiLU is computed by the sigmoid function multiplied by its input.	Semantic Scholar
Second, we suggest that the more traditional approach of using on-policy learning with eligibility traces, instead of experience replay, and softmax action selection can be competitive with DQN, without the need for a separate target network.	Semantic Scholar
We validate our proposed approach by, first, achieving new state-of-the-art results in both stochastic SZ-Tetris and Tetris with a small 10 × 10 board, using TD(λ) learning and shallow dSiLU network agents, and, then, by outperforming DQN in the Atari 2600 domain by using a deep Sarsa(λ) agent with SiLU and dSiLU hidden units.	Semantic Scholar
We present an algorithm to estimate the rotational motion of an event camera.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to traditional cameras, which produce images at a fixed rate, event cameras have independent pixels that respond asynchronously to brightness changes, with microsecond resolution.	Semantic Scholar
Our method leverages the type of information conveyed by these novel sensors (i.e., edges) to directly estimate the angular velocity of the camera, without requiring optical flow or image intensity estimation.	Semantic Scholar
The core of the method is a contrast maximization design.	Semantic Scholar
The method performs favorably against ground truth data and gyroscopic measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit, even in the presence of very high-speed motions (close to 1000 deg/s).	Semantic Scholar
The development of autonomous lightweight MAVs, capable of navigating in unknown indoor environments, is one of the major challenges in robotics.	Semantic Scholar
The complexity of this challenge comes from constraints on weight and power consumption of onboard sensing and processing devices.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose the “Droplet” strategy, an avoidance strategy based on stereo vision inputs that outperforms reactive avoidance strategies by allowing constant speed maneuvers while being computationally extremely efficient, and which does not need to store previous images or maps.	Semantic Scholar
The strategy deals with nonholonomic motion constraints of most fixed and flapping wing platforms, and with the limited field-of-view of stereo camera systems.	Semantic Scholar
It guarantees obstacle-free flight in the absence of sensor and motor noise.	Semantic Scholar
We first analyze the strategy in simulation, and then show its robustness in real-world conditions by implementing it on a 20-gram flapping wing MAV.	Semantic Scholar
Hybrid zero dynamics (HZD) has emerged as a popular framework for dynamic walking but has significant implementation difficulties when applied to the high degrees of freedom humanoids.	Semantic Scholar
The primary impediment is the process of gait design—it is difficult for optimizers to converge on a viable set of virtual constraints defining a gait.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a methodology that allows for fast and reliable generation of dynamic robotic walking gaits through the HZD framework, even in the presence of underactuation.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we describe an optimization formulation that builds upon the novel combination of HZD and direct collocation methods.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, achieving a scalable implementation required developing a defect-variable substitution formulation to simplify expressions, which ultimately allows us to generate compact analytic Jacobians of the constraints.	Semantic Scholar
We experimentally validate our methodology on an underactuated humanoid, DURUS, a spring-legged machine designed to facilitate energy-economical walking.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the optimization approach, in concert with the HZD framework, yields dynamic and stable walking gaits in hardware with a total electrical cost of transport of 1.33.	Semantic Scholar
As the optical lenses for cameras always have limited depth of field, the captured images with the same scene are not all in focus.	Semantic Scholar
Multifocus image fusion is an efficient technology that can synthesize an all-in-focus image using several partially focused images.	Semantic Scholar
Previous methods have accomplished the fusion task in spatial or transform domains.	Semantic Scholar
However, fusion rules are always a problem in most methods.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, from the aspect of focus region detection, we propose a novel multifocus image fusion method based on a fully convolutional network (FCN) learned from synthesized multifocus images.	Semantic Scholar
The primary novelty of this method is that the pixel-wise focus regions are detected through a learning FCN, and the entire image, not just the image patches, are exploited to train the FCN.	Semantic Scholar
First, we synthesize 4500 pairs of multifocus images by repeatedly using a gaussian filter for each image from PASCAL VOC 2012, to train the FCN.	Semantic Scholar
After that, a pair of source images is fed into the trained FCN, and two score maps indicating the focus property are generated.	Semantic Scholar
Next, an inversed score map is averaged with another score map to produce an aggregative score map, which take full advantage of focus probabilities in two score maps.	Semantic Scholar
We implement the fully connected conditional random field (CRF) on the aggregative score map to accomplish and refine a binary decision map for the fusion task.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we exploit the weighted strategy based on the refined decision map to produce the fused image.	Semantic Scholar
To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, we compare its fused results with several start-of-the-art methods not only on a gray data set but also on a color data set.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve superior fusion performance in both human visual quality and objective assessment.	Semantic Scholar
Traditional industrial applications involve robots with limited mobility.	Semantic Scholar
Consequently, interaction (e.g.	Semantic Scholar
manipulation) was treated separately from whole-body posture (e.g.	Semantic Scholar
balancing), assuming the robot firmly connected to the ground.	Semantic Scholar
Foreseen applications involve robots with augmented autonomy and physicalmobility.Within this novel context, physical interaction influences stability and balance.	Semantic Scholar
To allow robots to surpass barriers between interaction and posture control, forthcoming robotic research needs to investigate the principles governing whole-body motion and coordination with contact dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
There is a need to investigate the principles of motion and coordination of physical interaction, including the aspects related to unpredictability.	Semantic Scholar
Recent developments in compliant actuation and touch sensing allow safe and robust physical interaction from unexpected contact including humans.	Semantic Scholar
The next advancement for cognitive robots, however, is the ability not only to cope with unpredictable contact, but also to exploit predictable contact in ways that will assist in goal achievement.	Semantic Scholar
Last but not least, theoretical results needs to be validated in real-world scenarios with humanoid robots engaged in whole-body goaldirected tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Robots should be capable of exploiting rigid supportive contacts, learning to compensate for compliant contacts, and utilizing assistive physical interaction from humans.	Semantic Scholar
The work presented in this paper presents state-of-the-art in these domains as well as some recent advances made within the framework of the CoDyCo European project.	Semantic Scholar

To address this issue, this paper proposes a unified window function to describe a general memristor with restrictions of its parameters given.	Semantic Scholar
Compared with other window functions, the proposed function demonstrates high validity and accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
In order to make the simulation results have high consistency with the results of actual circuit, we apply the new window function to the simulation of a memristor-based multilayer neural network (MNN) circuit.	Semantic Scholar
The overall accuracy will vary with the change of control parameters in the window function.	Semantic Scholar
It implies that the proposed model can guide the design of actual memristor-based circuits.	Semantic Scholar
This paper is concerned with the fixed-time synchronization control of inertial memristor-based neural networks with discrete delay.	Semantic Scholar
We design four different kinds of feedback controllers, under which the considered inertial memristor-based neural networks can realize fixed-time synchronization perfectly.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the obtained fixed-time synchronization criteria can be verified by algebraic operations.	Semantic Scholar
For any initial synchronization error, the settling time of fixed-time synchronization is bounded by a fixed constant, which can be calculated beforehand based on system parameters and controller parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.	Semantic Scholar

Network embedding, aiming to embed a network into a low dimensional vector space while preserving the inherent structural properties of the network, has attracted considerable attention.	Semantic Scholar
However, most existing embedding methods focus on the static network while neglecting the evolving characteristic of real-world networks.	Semantic Scholar
Meanwhile, most of previous methods cannot well preserve the high-order proximity, which is a critical structural property of networks.	Semantic Scholar
These problems motivate us to seek an effective and efficient way to preserve the high-order proximity in embedding vectors when the networks evolve over time.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a novel method of Dynamic High-order Proximity preserved Embedding (DHPE).	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we adopt the generalized SVD (GSVD) to preserve the high-order proximity.	Semantic Scholar
Then, by transforming the GSVD problem to a generalized eigenvalue problem, we propose a generalized eigen perturbation to incrementally update the results of GSVD to incorporate the changes of dynamic networks.	Semantic Scholar
Further, we propose an accelerated solution to the DHPE model so that it achieves a linear time complexity with respect to the number of nodes and number of changed edges in the network.	Semantic Scholar
Our empirical experiments on one synthetic network and several real-world networks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
Despite the classic nature of the problem, trajectory tracking for soft robots, i.e., robots with compliant elements deliberately introduced in their design, still presents several challenges.	Semantic Scholar
One of these is to design controllers which can obtain sufficiently high performance while preserving the physical characteristics intrinsic to soft robots.	Semantic Scholar
Indeed, classic control schemes using high-gain feedback actions fundamentally alter the natural compliance of soft robots effectively stiffening them, thus de facto defeating their main design purpose.	Semantic Scholar
As an alternative approach, we consider here using a low-gain feedback, while exploiting feedforward components.	Semantic Scholar
In order to cope with the complexity and uncertainty of the dynamics, we adopt a decentralized, iteratively learned feedforward action, combined with a locally optimal feedback control.	Semantic Scholar
The relative authority of the feedback and feedforward control actions adapts with the degree of uncertainty of the learned component.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness of the method is experimentally verified on several robotic structures and working conditions, including unexpected interactions with the environment, where preservation of softness is critical for safety and robustness.	Semantic Scholar

Appropriate similarity measures always play a critical role in data analytics, learning, and processing.	Semantic Scholar
Measuring the intrinsic similarity of categorical data for unsupervised learning has not been substantially addressed, and even less effort has been made for the similarity analysis of categorical data that is not independent and identically distributed (non-IID).	Semantic Scholar
In this work, a Coupled Metric Similarity (CMS) is defined for unsupervised learning which flexibly captures the value-to-attribute-to-object heterogeneous coupling relationships.	Semantic Scholar
CMS learns the similarities in terms of intrinsic heterogeneous intra- and inter-attribute couplings and attribute-to-object couplings in categorical data.	Semantic Scholar
The CMS validity is guaranteed by satisfying metric properties and conditions, and CMS can flexibly adapt to IID to non-IID data.	Semantic Scholar
CMS is incorporated into spectral clustering and k-modes clustering and compared with relevant state-of-the-art similarity measures that are not necessarily metrics.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results and theoretical analysis show the CMS effectiveness of capturing independent and coupled data characteristics, which significantly outperforms other similarity measures on most datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Probabilistic queries have been extensively explored to provide answers with confidence, in order to support the real-life applications struggling with uncertain data, such as sensor networks and data integration.	Semantic Scholar

Robots are finding new applications where physical interaction with a human is necessary, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and social tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Accordingly, the field of physical human–robot interaction (pHRI) has leveraged impedance control approaches, which support compliant interactions between human and robot.	Semantic Scholar
However, a limitation of traditional impedance control is that—despite provisions for the human to modify the robot's current trajectory—the human cannot affect the robot's future desired trajectory through pHRI.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present an algorithm for physically interactive trajectory deformations which, when combined with impedance control, allows the human to modulate both the actual and desired trajectories of the robot.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike related works, our method explicitly deforms the future desired trajectory based on forces applied during pHRI, but does not require constant human guidance.	Semantic Scholar
We present our approach and verify that this method is compatible with traditional impedance control.	Semantic Scholar
Next, we use constrained optimization to derive the deformation shape.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we describe an algorithm for real-time implementation, and perform simulations to test the arbitration parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results demonstrate reduction in the human's effort and improvement in the movement quality when compared to pHRI with impedance control alone.	Semantic Scholar

In privacy-preserving record linkage, a number of data custodians encode their records and submit them to a trusted third-party who is responsible for identifying those records that refer to the same real-world entity.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose FEDERAL, a novel record linkage framework that implements methods for anonymizing both string and numerical data values, which are typically present in data records.	Semantic Scholar
These methods rely on a strong theoretical foundation for rigorously specifying the dimensionality of the anonymization space, into which the original values are embedded, to provide accuracy and privacy guarantees under various models of privacy attacks.	Semantic Scholar
A key component of the applied embedding process is the threshold that is required by the distance computations, which we prove can be formally specified to guarantee accurate results.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our framework using three real-world data sets with varying characteristics.	Semantic Scholar
Our experimental findings show that FEDERAL offers a complete and effective solution for accurately identifying matching anonymized record pairs (with recall rates constantly above 93 percent) in large-scale privacy-preserving record linkage tasks.	Semantic Scholar
It is difficult to estimate the mutual information between spike trains because established methods require more data than are usually available.	Semantic Scholar
Kozachenko-Leonenko estimators promise to solve this problem but include a smoothing parameter that must be set.	Semantic Scholar
We propose here that the smoothing parameter can be selected by maximizing the estimated unbiased mutual information.	Semantic Scholar
This is tested on fictive data and shown to work very well.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, an identifier-critic structure is introduced to find an online near-optimal controller for continuous-time nonaffine nonlinear systems having saturated control signal.	Semantic Scholar
By employing two Neural Networks (NNs), the solution of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation associated with the cost function is derived without requiring a priori knowledge about system dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
Weights of the identifier and critic NNs are tuned online and simultaneously such that unknown terms are approximated accurately and the control signal is kept between the saturation bounds.	Semantic Scholar
The convergence of NNs' weights, identification error, and system states is guaranteed using Lyapunov's direct method.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, simulation results are performed on two nonlinear systems to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.	Semantic Scholar

Emerging vehicular trajectory data have opened up opportunities to benefit many real-world applications, e.g., frequent trajectory based navigation systems, road planning, car pooling, etc.	Semantic Scholar
The similarity join is a key operation to enable such applications, which finds <italic>similar</italic> trajectory pairs from two large collections of trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
Existing similarity metrics on trajectories rely on aligning sampling points of two trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
However, due to different sampling rates or different vehicular speeds, the sample points in similar trajectories may not be aligned.	Semantic Scholar
"To address this problem, we propose a new bi-directional mapping similarity (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mathtt{BDS}$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""li-ieq1-2651821.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula>), which allows a sample point of a trajectory to align to the closest location (which may not be a sample point) on the other trajectory, and vice versa."	Semantic Scholar
Since it is expensive to enumerate every two trajectories and compute their similarity, we propose <monospace> Strain-Join</monospace>, a signature-based trajectory similarity join framework.	Semantic Scholar
<monospace>Strain-Join</monospace> first generates signatures for each trajectory such that if two trajectories do not share common signatures, they cannot be similar.	Semantic Scholar
In order to utilize this property to prune dissimilar pairs, we devise several techniques to generate high-quality signatures and propose an efficient filtering algorithm to prune dissimilar pairs.	Semantic Scholar
For the pairs not pruned by the filtering algorithm, we propose effective verification algorithms to verify whether they are similar.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on real datasets show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, a system is presented to track the motion of a sensor-head relative to multiple objects of known geometry.	Semantic Scholar

The performance of the system is shown through experiments tracking various objects and ground truth measurements demonstrate the system's ability to provide accurate real-time motion estimates.	Semantic Scholar
As an initial application of the system, a 100-brick structure with complex geometry was built by hand using the tracking system and an augmented reality visualizer to guide construction.	Semantic Scholar
In the field of robotics, collaborative simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is still a challenging problem.	Semantic Scholar
The exploration of unknown large-scale environments benefits from sharing the work among multiple agents possibly equipped with different abilities, such as aerial or ground-based vehicles.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we specifically address data-efficiency for the exchange of visual information in a collaborative visual SLAM setup.	Semantic Scholar
For efficient data exchange, we extend a compression scheme for local binary features by two additional modes providing support for local features with additional depth information and an inter-view coding mode exploiting the spatial relations between views of a stereo camera system.	Semantic Scholar
To demonstrate the coding framework, we use a centralized system architecture based on ORB-SLAM2, where energy-constrained agents extract local binary features and send a compressed version over a network to a more powerful agent, which is capable of running several visual SLAM instances in parallel.	Semantic Scholar
We exploit the information from other agents by detecting the overlap between already mapped areas and subsequent merging of the maps.	Semantic Scholar
Henceforth, the participants contribute to a joint representation and benefit from shared map information.	Semantic Scholar
We show a reduction in terms of data-rate by 70.8% using the feature compression and a reduction in absolute trajectory error by 53.7% using the collaborative mapping strategy with three agents on the well-known KITTI dataset.	Semantic Scholar
For the benefit of the community, we provide a public version of the source code.	Semantic Scholar
In multi-agent systems, norms are a usual way to regulate the behaviour of autonomous agents.	Semantic Scholar
To be stable in different circumstances, norms are specified using high level terms, abstracting from the particular dynamics of the environment where the agents are situated.	Semantic Scholar
However, applying these norms requires a proper link with a concrete environment.	Semantic Scholar
Detaching that link from the norms themselves provides stability to the normative regulation but raises consistency and flexibility issues.	Semantic Scholar
Consistency is achieved when the abstract norms are coherent with the environment under regulation.	Semantic Scholar
Flexibility is achieved when different kinds of norms share the same interpretation about the environmental state.	Semantic Scholar
These properties are provided in some current works.	Semantic Scholar
However, since they are interrelated, there is not, to our knowledge, a single proposal providing all of them.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes the situated artificial institution (SAI) model to address these three issues—stability, consistency, and flexibility—by conceiving norms as part of institutions that provide, through the process of constitution, a social interpretation of the environmental state.	Semantic Scholar
After the presentation of the formalised model of SAI, a case study is used to illustrate and test this approach.	Semantic Scholar
With the increased application of model-based whole-body control in legged robots, there has been a resurgence of research interest into methods for accurate system identification.	Semantic Scholar
An important class of methods focuses on the inertial parameters of rigid-body systems.	Semantic Scholar
These parameters consist of the mass, first mass moment (related to center of mass location), and rotational inertia matrix of each link.	Semantic Scholar
The main contribution of this letter is to formulate physical-consistency constraints on these parameters as Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs).	Semantic Scholar
The use of these constraints in identification can accelerate convergence and increase robustness to noisy data.	Semantic Scholar
It is critically observed that the proposed LMIs are expressed in terms of the covariance of the mass distribution, rather than its rotational moments of inertia.	Semantic Scholar
With this perspective, connections to the classical problem of moments in mathematics are shown to yield new bounding-volume constraints on the mass distribution of each link.	Semantic Scholar
While previous work ensured physical plausibility or used convex optimization in identification, the LMIs here uniquely enable both advantages.	Semantic Scholar
Constraints are applied to identification of a leg for the MIT Cheetah 3 robot.	Semantic Scholar
Detailed properties of transmission components are identified alongside link inertias, with parameter optimization carried out to global optimality through semidefinite programming.	Semantic Scholar

Generally, such a deletion (insertion) is side effect free.	Semantic Scholar
The related data management applications include query result explanation, data debugging, and anonymizing datasets, which rely on understanding how interventions in a database affect the output of a query.	Semantic Scholar
View propagation is a natural and typical way to define such interventions, which seems to be well-studied.	Semantic Scholar
However, in general, the candidate update on a source database is picked up aimlessly in advance, making the updated database to be very distant from the original one no matter whether it is the maximum one.	Semantic Scholar

Standing postural control requires a complex interaction between the sensory and motor systems.	Semantic Scholar
Among sensory inputs, proprioception plays a fundamental role in the fine control of postural movements.	Semantic Scholar
In some neuromotor disorders, defects in the proprioceptive system may be associated with unsteady, uncoordinated, and exacerbated upper body movements during activities of daily living that may secondarily result in imbalance, falls, and severe injuries.	Semantic Scholar
Passive or active proprioceptive interventions are implemented routinely as a critical part of rehabilitation programs that target postural balance disorders.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we have created a novel multimodal robotic platform merging both passive and active modalities to enhance upper body control.	Semantic Scholar
We hypothesize that the combination of passive resistance at pelvis in combination with active control of the lower thorax via assist-as-needed haptic feedback can enhance standing postural control.	Semantic Scholar
To test this hypothesis, we recruited ten healthy adults and had them perform dexterous reaching tasks either with or without a robotic system, while they stood unstably on a balance ball.	Semantic Scholar
The results of our pilot study show that individuals can improve postural stability of the upper body by selectively reducing upper trunk motion relative to caudal segments in the direction of the reaching arm, after training with the robotic platform.	Semantic Scholar

Tracking of multiple targets in a crowded environment using tracking by detection algorithms has been investigated thoroughly.	Semantic Scholar
Although these techniques are quite successful, they suffer from the loss of much detailed information about targets in detection boxes, which is highly desirable in many applications like activity recognition.	Semantic Scholar
To address this problem, we propose an approach that tracks superpixels instead of detection boxes in multi-view video sequences.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we first extract superpixels from detection boxes and then associate them within each detection box, over several views and time steps that lead to a combined segmentation, reconstruction, and tracking of superpixels.	Semantic Scholar
We construct a flow graph and incorporate both visual and geometric cues in a global optimization framework to minimize its cost.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, we simultaneously achieve segmentation, reconstruction and tracking of targets in video.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for tracking while achieving comparable results in segmentation.	Semantic Scholar

Striatal oscillations in the low-gamma frequency range have been consistently recorded in a number of experimental studies.	Semantic Scholar
However, whether these rhythms are locally generated in the striatum circuit, which is mainly composed of GABAergic neurons, remains an open question.	Semantic Scholar
GABAergic medium spiny projection neurons represent the great majority of striatal neurons, but they fire at very low rates.	Semantic Scholar
GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons typically show firing rates that are approximately 10 times higher than those of principal neurons, but they are a very small minority of the total neuronal population.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, based on physiological constraints we developed a computational network model of these neurons and dissected the oscillations.	Semantic Scholar
Simulations showed that the population of medium spiny projection neurons, and not the GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons, determines the frequency range of the oscillations.	Semantic Scholar
D2-type dopamine receptor-expressing neurons dominate the generation of low-gamma rhythms.	Semantic Scholar
Feedforward inputs from GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons promote the oscillations by strengthening the inhibitory interactions between medium spiny projection neurons.	Semantic Scholar
The promotion effect is independent of the degree of synchronization in the fast-spiking interneuron population but affected by the strength of their feedforward inputs to medium spiny projection neurons.	Semantic Scholar
Our results provide a theoretical explanation for how firing properties and connections of the three types of GABAergic neurons, which are susceptible to on-going behaviors, experience, and dopamine disruptions, sculpt striatal oscillations.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents an efficient approach to contact force distribution, which is aimed at computing optimal contact forces to generate the required wrench for grasping an object.	Semantic Scholar
It has been derived in the previous work that this problem can be reduced to computing the intersection of the ray originating from the origin along the required wrench with the boundary of the grasp wrench set.	Semantic Scholar
Noticing that the grasp wrench set is fixed once contact positions are determined, we propose an algorithm to precompute a hierarchy of polytopes in the grasp wrench set and a list of facets from the interior of the grasp wrench set to its boundary.	Semantic Scholar
Then, the ray’s intersection can be quickly found by searching the list of facets and optimal contact forces can be computed in real time.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical examples show that the online computation of the proposed approach is one order of magnitude faster than the latest algorithm to compute the ray’s intersection and two orders of magnitude faster than general-purpose optimization algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
This approach to contact force distribution is an iterative solution that can run until reaching a desired accuracy.	Semantic Scholar

"The average torque required to fully extend a subject's index finger MCP joint ranged from <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$0.22-0.75\,\text{N}\cdot \text{m}$</tex-math></inline-formula> and the thumb's MCP from <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX""> $0.29-1.35\,\text{N} \cdot \text{m}$</tex-math></inline-formula>."	Semantic Scholar
The highest torques were recorded when subjects were asked to volitionally extend their fingers, causing an increase in flexor tone requiring more assistance to overcome than when they were relaxed.	Semantic Scholar
TimSort is the main sorting algorithm provided by the Java standard library and many other programming frameworks.	Semantic Scholar
Our original goal was functional verification of TimSort with mechanical proofs.	Semantic Scholar
However, during our verification attempt we discovered a bug which causes the implementation to crash by an uncaught exception.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we identify conditions under which the bug occurs, and from this we derive a bug-free version that does not compromise performance.	Semantic Scholar
We formally specify the new version and verify termination and the absence of exceptions including the bug.	Semantic Scholar
This verification is carried out mechanically with KeY, a state-of-the-art interactive verification tool for Java.	Semantic Scholar
We provide a detailed description and analysis of the proofs.	Semantic Scholar
The complexity of the proofs required extensions and new capabilities in KeY, including symbolic state merging.	Semantic Scholar
Drones are rapidly becoming an affordable and often faster solution for parcel delivery than terrestrial vehicles.	Semantic Scholar
Existing transportation drones and software infrastructures are mostly designed by logistics companies for trained users and dedicated infrastructure, and are to be used for either long range (<150 km) or last-mile delivery (<20 km).	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents Dronistics, an integrated software and hardware system for last-centimeter (<5 km) person-to-person delivery using cargo drones.	Semantic Scholar
The system is conceived to be intuitive and intrinsically safe to enable short-distance deliveries between inexperienced users.	Semantic Scholar
Dronistics is composed of a safe foldable drone (PackDrone) and a web application software to intuitively control and track the drone in real time.	Semantic Scholar
In order to assess Dronistics’ user acceptance, we conducted 150 deliveries over one month on the EPFL campus in Switzerland.	Semantic Scholar
Here we describe the results of these tests by analyzing flight statistics, environmental conditions, and user reactions.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we also describe technical problems that occurred during flight tests and solutions that could prevent them.	Semantic Scholar
This article presents a review of computational methods for connectivity inference from neural activity data derived from multi-electrode recordings or fluorescence imaging.	Semantic Scholar
We first identify biophysical and technical challenges in connectivity inference along the data processing pipeline.	Semantic Scholar
We then review connectivity inference methods based on two major mathematical foundations, namely, descriptive model-free approaches and generative model-based approaches.	Semantic Scholar
We investigate representative studies in both categories and clarify which challenges have been addressed by which method.	Semantic Scholar
We further identify critical open issues and possible research directions.	Semantic Scholar

In this letter, we consider the problem of recovering the rotation and translation changes of a moving camera from captured images.	Semantic Scholar
This problem is traditionally solved using the epipolar constraint, where the rotation and translation changes are recovered from the essential matrix.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a new formulation based on quaternion representation of rotation.	Semantic Scholar
Using this formulation, we recover the rotation and translation changes separately without resorting to an essential matrix.	Semantic Scholar
We compare the estimation accuracy and execution time of the proposed method with several state-of-the-art algorithms using both synthetic and actual image sequences.	Semantic Scholar
On average, our approach shows better accuracy in the presence of noise, but it has a larger execution time.	Semantic Scholar
For the benefit of community, we have made the implementation of our algorithm available online and free.	Semantic Scholar

In this letter, we present algorithms to estimate contact locations, external forces, and joint torques using skin, i.e., distributed tactile sensors, kinematic sensors, and a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) without the need for force-torque sensors.	Semantic Scholar
Distributed tactile sensors are an array of discrete tactile sensors (taxels) with gaps between them.	Semantic Scholar
To cope with the gaps, we use interpolation techniques to improve accuracy of the measurements in the skin.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we estimate the external force.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we use this information combined with the contact location obtained from the skin to estimate the joint torques.	Semantic Scholar
Validation was performed using the iCub humanoid robot.	Semantic Scholar
Results show a performance comparable to the joint torque estimation using expensive force-torque sensors.	Semantic Scholar
Since the skin is less expensive and does not require modification of the internal structure of the robot, using the skin is an interesting solution.	Semantic Scholar
Robot navigation using deep neural networks has been drawing a great deal of attention.	Semantic Scholar
Although reactive neural networks easily learn expert behaviors and are computationally efficient, they suffer from generalization of policies learned in specific environments.	Semantic Scholar
As such, reinforcement learning and value iteration approaches for learning generalized policies have been proposed.	Semantic Scholar
However, these approaches are more costly.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we tackle the problem of learning reactive neural networks that are applicable to general environments.	Semantic Scholar
The key concept is to crop, rotate, and rescale an obstacle map according to the goal location and the agent's current location so that the map representation will be better correlated with self-movement in the general navigation task, rather than the layout of the environment.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, in addition to the obstacle map, we input a map of visited locations that contains the movement history of the agent, in order to avoid failures that the agent travels back and forth repeatedly over the same location.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results reveal that the proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art value iteration network in the grid-world navigation task.	Semantic Scholar
We also demonstrate that the proposed model can be well generalized to unseen obstacles and unknown terrain.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed system enables a mobile robot to successfully navigate in a real dynamic environment.	Semantic Scholar
The notion of a monad cannot be expressed within higher-order logic (HOL) due to type system restrictions.	Semantic Scholar
I show that if a monad is restricted to values of a fixed type, this notion can be formalised in HOL.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this idea, I develop a library of effect specifications and implementations of monads and monad transformers.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, I can abstract over the concrete monad in HOL definitions and thus use the same definition for different (combinations of) effects.	Semantic Scholar
I illustrate the usefulness of effect polymorphism with a monadic interpreter.	Semantic Scholar
While deep learning has become a key ingredient in the top performing methods for many computer vision tasks, it has failed so far to bring similar improvements to instance-level image retrieval.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we argue that reasons for the underwhelming results of deep methods on image retrieval are threefold: (1) noisy training data, (2) inappropriate deep architecture, and (3) suboptimal training procedure.	Semantic Scholar
We address all three issues.	Semantic Scholar
First, we leverage a large-scale but noisy landmark dataset and develop an automatic cleaning method that produces a suitable training set for deep retrieval.	Semantic Scholar
Second, we build on the recent R-MAC descriptor, show that it can be interpreted as a deep and differentiable architecture, and present improvements to enhance it.	Semantic Scholar
Last, we train this network with a siamese architecture that combines three streams with a triplet loss.	Semantic Scholar
At the end of the training process, the proposed architecture produces a global image representation in a single forward pass that is well suited for image retrieval.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms previous retrieval approaches, including state-of-the-art methods based on costly local descriptor indexing and spatial verification.	Semantic Scholar
On Oxford 5k, Paris 6k and Holidays, we respectively report 94.7, 96.6, and 94.8 mean average precision.	Semantic Scholar
Our representations can also be heavily compressed using product quantization with little loss in accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
While existing logistic regression suffers from overfitting and often fails in considering structural information, we propose a novel matrix-based logistic regression to overcome the weakness.	Semantic Scholar
In the proposed method, 2D matrices are directly used to learn two groups of parameter vectors along each dimension without vectorization, which allows the proposed method to fully exploit the underlying structural information embedded inside the 2D matrices.	Semantic Scholar
Further, we add a joint -norm on two parameter matrices, which are organized by aligning each group of parameter vectors in columns.	Semantic Scholar
This added co-regularization term has two roles—enhancing the effect of regularization and optimizing the rank during the learning process.	Semantic Scholar
With our proposed fast iterative solution, we carried out extensive experiments.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that in comparison to both the traditional tensor-based methods and the vector-based regression methods, our proposed solution achieves better performance for matrix data classifications.	Semantic Scholar
"Nowadays, many location-based applications require the ability of querying <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""cao-ieq2-2808971.gif""/> </alternatives></inline-formula>-nearest neighbors over a very large scale of moving objects in road networks, e.g., taxi-calling and ride-sharing services."	Semantic Scholar
Traditional grid index with equal-sized cells can not adapt to the skewed distribution of moving objects in real scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, to obtain the fast querying response time, the grid needs to be split into more smaller cells which introduces the side-effect of higher memory cost, i.e., maintaining such a large volume of cells requires a much larger memory space at the server side.	Semantic Scholar

Semantic Scholar
It is far from trivial to perform the space expansion within the hierarchical grid index.	Semantic Scholar
For a given cell, we first define its neighbors in different directions, then propose a cell communication technique which allows each cell in the hierarchical grid index to be aware of its neighbors at any time.	Semantic Scholar
Accordingly, an efficient space expansion algorithm to generate the estimation area is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
"The experimental evaluation shows that <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\sf {SIMkNN}$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""cao-ieq6-2808971.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> outperforms the baseline algorithm in terms of time and memory efficiency."

In this paper, a one-layer recurrent neural network is proposed for solving a class of nonsmooth, pseudoconvex optimization problems with general convex constraints.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the smoothing method, we construct a new regularization function, which does not depend on any information of the feasible region.	Semantic Scholar
"Thanks to the special structure of the regularization function, we prove the global existence, uniqueness and ""slow solution"" character of the state of the proposed neural network."	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the state solution of the proposed network is proved to be convergent to the feasible region in finite time and to the optimal solution set of the related optimization problem subsequently.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the convergence of the state to an exact optimal solution is also considered in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical examples with simulation results are given to show the efficiency and good characteristics of the proposed network.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, some preliminary theoretical analysis and application of the proposed network for a wider class of dynamic portfolio optimization are included.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a multiple slicing model for three-dimensional (3-D) images of human face, using the frontal, sagittal, and transverse orthogonal planes.	Semantic Scholar
The definition of the segments depends on just one key point, the nose tip, which makes it simple and independent of the detection of several key points.	Semantic Scholar
For facial recognition, attributes based on adapted 2-D spatial moments of Hu and 3-D spatial invariant rotation moments are extracted from each segment.	Semantic Scholar

These results approach the state-of-the-art using Bosphorus Database and even surpasses it when anger and disgust expressions are evaluated.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we also evaluate the generalization of our method using the FRGC v2.0 database and achieve competitive results, making the technique promising, especially for its simplicity.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we perform a complete and in-depth analysis of Lorentzian noises, such as those arising from and channel kinetics, in order to identify the source of –type noise in neurological membranes.	Semantic Scholar
We prove that the autocovariance of Lorentzian noise depends solely on the eigenvalues (time constants) of the kinetic matrix but that the Lorentzian weighting coefficients depend entirely on the eigenvectors of this matrix.	Semantic Scholar
We then show that there are rotations of the kinetic eigenvectors that send any initial weights to any target weights without altering the time constants.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we show there are target weights for which the resulting Lorenztian noise has an approximately –type spectrum.	Semantic Scholar
We justify these kinetic rotations by introducing a quantum mechanical formulation of membrane stochastics, called hidden quantum activated-measurement models, and prove that these quantum models are probabilistically indistinguishable from the classical hidden Markov models typically used for ion channel stochastics.	Semantic Scholar
The quantum dividend obtained by replacing classical with quantum membranes is that rotations of the Lorentzian weights become simple readjustments of the quantum state without any change to the laboratory-determined kinetic and conductance parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the quantum formalism allows us to model the activation energy of a membrane, and we show that maximizing entropy under constrained activation energy yields the previous –type Lorentzian weights, in which the spectral exponent is a Lagrange multiplier for the energy constraint.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, we provide a plausible neurophysical mechanism by which channel and membrane kinetics can give rise to –type noise (something that has been occasionally denied in the literature), as well as a realistic and experimentally testable explanation for the numerical values of the spectral exponents.	Semantic Scholar
We also discuss applications of quantum membranes beyond –type -noise, including applications to animal models and possible impact on quantum foundations.	Semantic Scholar
Body weight support (BWS) systems are widely used in gait research and rehabilitation.	Semantic Scholar
This letter introduces a new three-dimensional overground BWS system, called the RYSEN.	Semantic Scholar
The RYSEN is designed to be intrinsically safe and low power consuming, while still performing at least as well as existing BWS systems regarding human–robot interaction.	Semantic Scholar
These features are mainly achieved by decoupling degrees of freedom between motors: slow/high-torque motors for vertical motion and fast/low-torque motors for horizontal motion.	Semantic Scholar
This letter explains the design and evaluates its performance on power consumption and safety.	Semantic Scholar
Power consumption is expressed in terms of the sum of the positive mechanical output power of all motor axes.	Semantic Scholar
Safety is defined as the difference between the mechanical power available for horizontal and vertical movements and the mechanical power that is needed to perform its task.	Semantic Scholar
The results of the RYSEN are compared to the performance of three similar systems: a gantry, the FLOAT, and a classic cable robot.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that the RYSEN and a gantry consume approximately the same amount of power.	Semantic Scholar
The amount is approximately half the power consumed by the next-best system.	Semantic Scholar
For the safety, the gantry is taken as the benchmark, because of its perfect decoupling of directions.	Semantic Scholar
The RYSEN has a surplus of 268 W and 126 W for horizontal and vertical movements, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
This is significantly lower than the next-best system, which has a surplus of 1088 W and 1967 W, respectively.	Semantic Scholar

Fourier Mellin SOFT (FMS) as a novel method for global registration of 3D data is presented.	Semantic Scholar
It determines the seven degrees of freedom (7-DoF) transformation, i.e., the 6-DoF rigid motion parameters plus 1-DoF scale, between two scans, i.e., two noisy, only partially overlapping views on objects or scenes.	Semantic Scholar
It is based on a sequence of the 3D Fourier transform, the Mellin transform and the SO(3) Fourier transform.	Semantic Scholar
This combination represents a non-trivial complete 3D extension of the well known Fourier-Mellin registration for 2D images.	Semantic Scholar
It is accordingly based on decoupling rotation and scale from translation.	Semantic Scholar
First, rotation—which is the main challenge for the extension to 3D data - is tackled with a SO(3) Fourier Transform (SOFT) based on Spherical Harmonics.	Semantic Scholar
In a second step, scale is determined via a 3D Mellin transform.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, translation is calculated by Phase-Matching.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments are presented with simulated data sets for ground truth comparisons and with real world data including object recognition and localization in Magnetic Resonance Tomography (MRT) data, registration of 2.5D RGBD scans from a Microsoft Kinect with a scale-free 3D model generated by Multi-View Vision, and 3D mapping by registration of a sequence of consecutive scans from a low-cost actuated Laser Range Finder.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that the method is fast and that it can robustly handle partial overlap, interfering structures, and noise.	Semantic Scholar
It is also shown that the method is a very interesting option for 6-DoF registration, i.e., when scale is known.	Semantic Scholar
As one of the fundamental tasks in text analysis, phrase mining aims at extracting quality phrases from a text corpus and has various downstream applications including information extraction/retrieval, taxonomy construction, and topic modeling.	Semantic Scholar
Most existing methods rely on complex, trained linguistic analyzers, and thus likely have unsatisfactory performance on text corpora of new domains and genres without extra but expensive adaption.	Semantic Scholar
None of the state-of-the-art models, even data-driven models, is fully automated because they require human experts for designing rules or labeling phrases.	Semantic Scholar
"In this paper, we propose a novel framework for automated phrase mining, <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mathsf{AutoPhrase}$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""shang-ieq1-2812203.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula>, which supports any language as long as a general knowledge base (e.g., Wikipedia) in that language is available, while benefiting from, but not requiring, a POS tagger."

Pyramidal neurons produce different spiking patterns to process information, communicate with each other and transform information.	Semantic Scholar
These spiking patterns have complex and multiple time scale dynamics that have been described with the fractional-order leaky integrate-and-Fire (FLIF) model.	Semantic Scholar
Models with fractional (non-integer) order differentiation that generalize power law dynamics can be used to describe complex temporal voltage dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
The main characteristic of FLIF model is that it depends on all past values of the voltage that causes long-term memory.	Semantic Scholar
The model produces spikes with high interspike interval variability and displays several spiking properties such as upward spike-frequency adaptation and long spike latency in response to a constant stimulus.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the subthreshold voltage and the firing rate of the fractional-order model make transitions from exponential to power law dynamics when the fractional order α decreases from 1 to smaller values.	Semantic Scholar
The firing rate displays different types of spike timing adaptation caused by changes on initial values.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that the voltage-memory trace and fractional coefficient are the causes of these different types of spiking properties.	Semantic Scholar
The voltage-memory trace that represents the long-term memory has a feedback regulatory mechanism and affects spiking activity.	Semantic Scholar
The results suggest that fractional-order models might be appropriate for understanding multiple time scale neuronal dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
Overall, a neuron with fractional dynamics displays history dependent activities that might be very useful and powerful for effective information processing.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel method for real-time face alignment in videos based on a recurrent encoder–decoder network model.	Semantic Scholar
Our proposed model predicts 2D facial point heat maps regularized by both detection and regression loss, while uniquely exploiting recurrent learning at both spatial and temporal dimensions.	Semantic Scholar
At the spatial level, we add a feedback loop connection between the combined output response map and the input, in order to enable iterative coarse-to-fine face alignment using a single network model, instead of relying on traditional cascaded model ensembles.	Semantic Scholar
At the temporal level, we first decouple the features in the bottleneck of the network into temporal-variant factors, such as pose and expression, and temporal-invariant factors, such as identity information.	Semantic Scholar
Temporal recurrent learning is then applied to the decoupled temporal-variant features.	Semantic Scholar
We show that such feature disentangling yields better generalization and significantly more accurate results at test time.	Semantic Scholar
We perform a comprehensive experimental analysis, showing the importance of each component of our proposed model, as well as superior results over the state of the art and several variations of our method in standard datasets.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, the path planning problem for a single autonomous robot treading on a static terrain is solved using optimal control theory.	Semantic Scholar
The performance measure selected for the optimal control formulation is the path length between a predefined initial and final position on an inertial frame of reference.	Semantic Scholar
The terrain features are assumed to be known a priori and is represented using a b-spline surface.	Semantic Scholar
The terrain tractability constraint is decoupled from the dynamic stability equation of the robot and absorbed as a terrain feature.	Semantic Scholar
The results indicate that the target is reached optimally and the trajectory is smooth.	Semantic Scholar
The smoothness of the trajectory eliminates the need for post processing for trajectory tracking.	Semantic Scholar
This formulation can be applied to path planning problems related to aerial and ground vehicles with minimum modifications to take care of the real time requirements.	Semantic Scholar
The cycling wheelchair, which is pedaled like a bicycle, is an effective device for improving its user's activities of daily living.	Semantic Scholar
It is commercially available in Japan, and is currently being used by hospitals and rehabilitation facilities.	Semantic Scholar
However, many patients, particularly those with lower-limb disabilities, would like to use it both indoors and outdoors.	Semantic Scholar
Indoor use requires relatively slow forward and backward movement combined with a small turning radius, all of which increase maneuverability in confined spaces.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast, outdoor use requires the cycling wheelchair to move faster with bicycle-like mobility and a freewheel mechanism for comfortable driving, although the latter precludes pedaling backward.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the user would like to ascend slopes easily and descend them safely.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, the cycling wheelchair requires a transmission system that can change the gear ratio based on the environment, and an automatic braking system.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we discuss in more detail the assistive functions required of the cycling wheelchair, and we realize them by developing a new cycling wheelchair with a continuously variable transmission and clutch.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we conduct experiments to illustrate the validity of the proposed cycling wheelchair and its control method.	Semantic Scholar
Most existing person re-identification (re-id) methods are unsuitable for real-world deployment due to two reasons: Unscalability to large population size, and Inadaptability over time.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we present a unified solution to address both problems.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we propose to construct an identity regression space (IRS) based on embedding different training person identities (classes) and formulate re-id as a regression problem solved by identity regression in the IRS.	Semantic Scholar
The IRS approach is characterised by a closed-form solution with high learning efficiency and an inherent incremental learning capability with human-in-the-loop.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on four benchmarking datasets (VIPeR, CUHK01, CUHK03 and Market-1501) show that the IRS model not only outperforms state-of-the-art re-id methods, but also is more scalable to large re-id population size by rapidly updating model and actively selecting informative samples with reduced human labelling effort.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a strategy to enable a team of mobile robots to adaptively sample and track a dynamic process.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a distributed strategy, where robots collect sparse sensor measurements, create a reduced-order model of a spatio-temporal process, and use this model to estimate field values for areas without sensor measurements of the dynamic process.	Semantic Scholar
The robots then use these estimates of the field, or inferences about the process, to adapt the model and reconfigure their sensing locations.	Semantic Scholar
The key contributions of this process are twofold: first, leveraging the dynamics of the process of interest to determine where to sample and how to estimate the process; and second, maintaining fully distributed models, sensor measurements, and estimates of the time-varying process.	Semantic Scholar
We illustrate the application of the proposed solution in simulation and compare it to centralized and global approaches.	Semantic Scholar
We also test our approach with physical marine robots sampling a process in a water tank.	Semantic Scholar
For older adults, familiarity plays an important role in reducing driving errors, improving wayfinding, and maintaining driving confidence.	Semantic Scholar
However, only a few studies have explored the influence of familiarity on driving behavior, route risk, and route choice among older drivers.	Semantic Scholar
The vehicles of 29 drivers age 65 and older were instrumented with on-board diagnostic devices for four months to record their routes driven, and risky driving behavior events.	Semantic Scholar
For each route driven, trip diaries were used to provide participants with retrospective feedback of their risky driving behaviors, alternate low-risk routes, and record answers to three questions pertaining to: familiarity with the route driven, suggested low-risk route alternative, and reasons for choosing a route.	Semantic Scholar
When familiarity responses were regressed on the number of risky driving behavior events, results showed that for every 10% increase in familiarity with driven routes, a 0.07 increase in risky driving behavior incidents per trip was estimated.	Semantic Scholar
Results from the generalized mixed effects regression showed that older drivers were less likely to drive a suggested low-risk route when they were more familiar with the alternate routes.	Semantic Scholar
Content analysis conducted on the reasons for choosing a familiar route showed that older drivers preferred routes that were direct, had less traffic, and depended on the trip purpose, such as running multiple errands.	Semantic Scholar
These results provide important insights on the influence of familiarity on route choice, preferences, and driving behaviors of older drivers and provide opportunities for developing targeted route choice models for navigation systems that can include factors such as familiarity.	Semantic Scholar
We consider scenarios where we have zero instances of real pedestrian data (e.g., a newly installed surveillance system in a novel location in which no labeled real data or unsupervised real data exists yet) and a pedestrian detector must be developed prior to any observations of pedestrians.	Semantic Scholar
Given a single image and auxiliary scene information in the form of camera parameters and geometric layout of the scene, our approach infers and generates a large variety of geometrically and photometrically accurate potential images of synthetic pedestrians along with purely accurate ground-truth labels through the use of computer graphics rendering engine.	Semantic Scholar
We first present an efficient discriminative learning method that takes these synthetic renders and generates a unique spatially-varying and geometry-preserving pedestrian appearance classifier customized for every possible location in the scene.	Semantic Scholar
"In order to extend our approach to multi-task learning for further analysis (i.e., estimating pose and segmentation of pedestrians besides detection), we build a more generalized model employing a fully convolutional neural network architecture for multi-task learning leveraging the “free"" ground-truth annotations that can be obtained from our pedestrian synthesizer."	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate that when real human annotated data is scarce or non-existent, our data generation strategy can provide an excellent solution for an array of tasks for human activity analysis including detection, pose estimation and segmentation.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that our approach (1) outperforms classical models and hybrid synthetic-real models, (2) outperforms various combinations of off-the-shelf state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors and pose estimators that are trained on real data, and (3) surprisingly, our method using purely synthetic data is able to outperform models trained on real scene-specific data when data is limited.	Semantic Scholar
The urban road networks undergo frequent traffic congestions during the peak hours and around the city center.	Semantic Scholar
Capturing the spatiotemporal evolution of the congestion scenario in real-time in an urban-scale can aid in developing smart traffic management systems, and guiding commuters in making informed decision about route choice.	Semantic Scholar
The congestion scenario is often represented by a set of distinguishable network partitions that have a homogeneous level of congestion inside them but are heterogeneous to others.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the dynamic nature of traffic, these partitions evolve with time in terms of their structure and location.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework to capture the evolution by incrementally updating the partitions in an efficient manner using a two-layer approach.	Semantic Scholar
The physical layer maintains a set of small-sized road network building blocks in a fine granularity, and performs low-level computations to incrementally update them, whereas the logical layer performs high-level computations in order to serve as an interface to query the physical layer about the congested partitions in a coarse granularity.	Semantic Scholar
We also propose an in-memory index called Bin that compactly stores the historical sets of building blocks in the main memory with no information loss, and facilitates their efficient retrieval.	Semantic Scholar
Our experimental results show that the proposed method is much efficient than the existing re-partitioning methods without significant sacrifice in accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed Bin consumes a minimum space with least redundancy at different time stamps.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we introduce Mixture of Attractors, a novel movement primitive representation that allows for learning complex object-relative movements.	Semantic Scholar
The movement primitive representation inherently supports multiple coordinate frames, enabling the system to generalize a skill to unseen object positions and orientations.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to most other approaches, a skill is learned by solving a convex optimization problem.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, the quality of the skill does not depend on a good initial estimate of parameters.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting movements are automatically smooth and can be of arbitrary shape.	Semantic Scholar
The approach is evaluated and compared to other movement primitive representations on data from the Omniglot handwriting dataset and on real demonstrations of a handwriting task.	Semantic Scholar
The evaluations show that the presented approach outperforms other state-of-the-art concepts in terms of generalization capabilities and accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
In the first part of this paper we present a formalization in Agda of the James construction in homotopy type theory.	Semantic Scholar
We include several fragments of code to show what the Agda code looks like, and we explain several techniques that we used in the formalization.	Semantic Scholar
In the second part, we use the James construction to give a constructive proof that $$\pi _4(\mathbb {S}^{3})$$ π4(S3) is of the form $$\mathbb {Z}/n\mathbb {Z}$$ Z/nZ (but we do not compute the n here).	Semantic Scholar
Imitating the behaviors of an arbitrary visual tracking algorithm enables many higher level tasks such as tracker identification and efficient tracker-fusion.	Semantic Scholar
It is also useful for discovering the features essential in a black-box tracker or learning from several trackers to form a super-tracker.	Semantic Scholar
"In this study, we propose a non-linear feature fusion framework, ""MIMIC"" that imitates many popular trackers by mixing a pool of heterogeneous features."	Semantic Scholar
The MIMIC framework consists of two subtasks, feature selection and feature weight tuning.	Semantic Scholar
These subtasks, however, tended to suffer from an overfitting problem when the number of videos available for training is limited.	Semantic Scholar
To address this issue, we incorporated Dropout algorithm into the training, which grants the trained MIMIC tracker a high degree of generalization.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments testified the effectiveness of the proposed framework so that its applications would be promoted into different related tasks in visual tracking.	Semantic Scholar
Localizing an object accurately with respect to a robot is a key step for autonomous robotic manipulation.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we propose to tackle this task knowing only 3D models of the robot and object in the particular case where the scene is viewed from uncalibrated cameras—a situation which would be typical in an uncontrolled environment, e.g., on a construction site.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate that this localization can be performed very accurately, with millimetric errors, without using a single real image for training, a strong advantage since acquiring representative training data is a long and expensive process.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach relies on a classification Convolutional Neural Network trained using hundreds of thousands of synthetically rendered scenes with randomized parameters.	Semantic Scholar
To evaluate our approach quantitatively and make it comparable to alternative approaches, we build a new rich dataset of real robot images with accurately localized blocks.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a 2-degree-of-freedom (DOF) joint with coupled variable output stiffness that makes use of three actuators, i.e., two for the 2-D joint motions and one for the joint stiffness adjustment.	Semantic Scholar
By base-mounting the actuators and the variable stiffness module that contains the passive elastic elements, the design is compact and has low actuated inertia.	Semantic Scholar
Since the joint has coupled variable stiffness characteristic in the 2-DOF motions, the number of required actuators is reduced.	Semantic Scholar
The 2-DOF variable stiffness joint has been realized and experimentally tested.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present selected benchmark aerial manipulation tasks using an aerial vehicle endowed with multi-degree of freedom manipulators.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed tasks analyze environmental coupling and are broken into three general categories: momentary, loose, and strong coupling.	Semantic Scholar
A classical control structure is derived, tuned, and verified through experiments, conducted for benchmarking purposes to include pick-and-place, insertion, and valve-turning tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Although other nonlinear controllers may prove more effective, the classical control approach has been selected in order to analyze contact stability and provide benchmark results for future reference.	Semantic Scholar
An analysis of system stability is conducted and implemented into the controller.	Semantic Scholar
A vision-based high-level controller fuses motion tracking data in order to provide control of both the aircraft and the manipulators, allowing the system to become coupled to the environment and perform the required operation.	Semantic Scholar
We present recent results validating our framework using the proposed aircraft-arm system.	Semantic Scholar
Feature selection approaches based on mutual information can be roughly categorized into two groups.	Semantic Scholar
The first group minimizes the redundancy of features between each other.	Semantic Scholar
The second group maximizes the new classification information of features providing for the selected subset.	Semantic Scholar
A critical issue is that large new information does not signify little redundancy, and vice versa.	Semantic Scholar
Features with large new information but with high redundancy may be selected by the second group, and features with low redundancy but with little relevance with classes may be highly scored by the first group.	Semantic Scholar
Existing approaches fail to balance the importance of both terms.	Semantic Scholar
As such, a new information term denoted as Independent Classification Information is proposed in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
It assembles the newly provided information and the preserved information negatively correlated with the redundant information.	Semantic Scholar
Redundancy and new information are properly unified and equally treated in the new term.	Semantic Scholar
This strategy helps find the predictive features providing large new information and little redundancy.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, independent classification information is proved as a loose upper bound of the total classification information of feature subset.	Semantic Scholar
Its maximization is conducive to achieve a high global discriminative performance.	Semantic Scholar
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approach.	Semantic Scholar
Multi-Task Learning (MTL) can enhance a classifier’s generalization performance by learning multiple related tasks simultaneously.	Semantic Scholar
Conventional MTL works under the offline or batch setting, and suffers from expensive training cost and poor scalability.	Semantic Scholar
To address such inefficiency issues, online learning techniques have been applied to solve MTL problems.	Semantic Scholar
However, most existing algorithms of online MTL constrain task relatedness into a presumed structure via a single weight matrix, which is a strict restriction that does not always hold in practice.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a robust online MTL framework that overcomes this restriction by decomposing the weight matrix into two components: The first one captures the low-rank common structure among tasks via a nuclear norm and the second one identifies the personalized patterns of outlier tasks via a group lasso.	Semantic Scholar
Theoretical analysis shows the proposed algorithm can achieve a sub-linear regret with respect to the best linear model in hindsight.	Semantic Scholar
Even though the above framework achieves good performance, the nuclear norm that simply adds all nonzero singular values together may not be a good low-rank approximation.	Semantic Scholar
To improve the results, we use a log-determinant function as a non-convex rank approximation.	Semantic Scholar
The gradient scheme is applied to optimize log-determinant function and can obtain a closed-form solution for this refined problem.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on a number of real-world applications verify the efficacy of our method.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, two upper limbs of an exoskeleton robot are operated within a constrained region of the operational space with unidentified intention of the human operator's motion as well as uncertain dynamics including physical limits.	Semantic Scholar
The new human-cooperative strategies are developed to detect the human subject's movement efforts in order to make the robot behavior flexible and adaptive.	Semantic Scholar
The motion intention extracted from the measurement of the subject's muscular effort in terms of the applied forces/torques can be represented to derive the reference trajectory of his/her limb using a viable impedance model.	Semantic Scholar
Then, adaptive online estimation for impedance parameters is employed to deal with the nonlinear and variable stiffness property of the limb model.	Semantic Scholar
In order for the robot to follow a specific impedance target, we integrate the motion intention estimation into a barrier Lyapunov function based adaptive impedance control.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments have been carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed dual-arm coordination control scheme, in terms of desired motion and force tracking.	Semantic Scholar
We present a formalization of classical algorithms for computing the maximum flow in a network: the Edmonds–Karp algorithm and the push–relabel algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
We prove correctness and time complexity of these algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Our formal proof closely follows a standard textbook proof, and is accessible even without being an expert in Isabelle/HOL—the interactive theorem prover used for the formalization.	Semantic Scholar
Using stepwise refinement techniques, we instantiate the generic Ford–Fulkerson algorithm to Edmonds–Karp algorithm, and the generic push–relabel algorithm of Goldberg and Tarjan to both the relabel-to-front and the FIFO push–relabel algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Further refinement then yields verified efficient implementations of the algorithms, which compare well to unverified reference implementations.	Semantic Scholar
Product yield directly affects production cost.	Semantic Scholar
Thus manufacturers seek to quickly enhance product yield during the development and mass-production processes.	Semantic Scholar
In other words, when a yield loss occurs, the root causes should be found rapidly in both the development and mass-production phases.	Semantic Scholar
When a yield loss is encountered, the traditional yield enhancement approach is to collect all production-related data to perform big data analysis in order to find out the root causes of affecting yield and remedy them.	Semantic Scholar
However, production-related data are extremely large and complicated, which makes it hard to search for the root causes of a yield loss.	Semantic Scholar
This leads to the problem of high-dimensional variable selection.	Semantic Scholar
To solve this problem, a scheme of Key-variable Search Algorithms (KSAs) is proposed in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
The inputs of this KSA scheme include production routes, process data, inline data, defects, and final inspection results; while the outputs are search results and their corresponding reliance indices.	Semantic Scholar
The search results are the key stages that cause the yield loss or the key variables that are the root causes of the yield loss.	Semantic Scholar
The thin film transistor-liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) process is adopted as the illustrative example to demonstrate the KSA scheme.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a new conversion of multivalued decision diagrams (MDD) to binary decision diagrams (BDD) which can be used to improve MDD-based fil- tering algorithms such as MDDC or MDD-4R.	Semantic Scholar
We also propose BDDF, an algorithm that copies modified parts of the BDD “on the fly” during the search of a solution, and yields a better incrementality than a pure MDDC-like approach.	Semantic Scholar
MDDC is not very efficient when used to represent poorly structured positive table constraints.	Semantic Scholar
Our new representation combined with BDDF retains the properties of the MDD representation and has comparable performances to the STR2 algorithm by Ullmann (2007) and Lecoutre (Constraints, 16.4, 341–371 2011).	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a novel rotational variable stiffness joint that relies on one motor and a set of variable stiffness springs.	Semantic Scholar
The variable stiffness springs are leaf springs with a layered design, i.e., an electro-active layer of electrospun aligned nanofibers of poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE)] surrounded by two electrodes of aluminum and held together by inactive material.	Semantic Scholar
To achieve a variable stiffness, different voltages and, therefore, different electric fields, are applied to the springs.	Semantic Scholar
The variable stiffness springs are electromechanically analyzed to highlight the voltage-deflection and force-deflection characteristics.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the springs are used in the design of a proof-of-concept variable stiffness joint prototype.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on the variable stiffness joint confirm the viability of the proposed solution.	Semantic Scholar
We study the necessary and sufficient complexity of ReLU neural networks - in terms of depth and number of weights - which is required for approximating classifier functions in an Lp-sense.	Semantic Scholar
"As a model class, we consider the set Eβ(Rd) of possibly discontinuous piecewise Cβ functions f:[-12,12]d→R, where the different ""smooth regions"" of f are separated by Cβ hypersurfaces."	Semantic Scholar
For given dimension d≥2, regularity β>0, and accuracy ε>0, we construct artificial neural networks with ReLU activation function that approximate functions from Eβ(Rd) up to an L2 error of ε.	Semantic Scholar
The constructed networks have a fixed number of layers, depending only on d and β, and they have O(ε-2(d-1)∕β) many nonzero weights, which we prove to be optimal.	Semantic Scholar
For the proof of optimality, we establish a lower bound on the description complexity of the class Eβ(Rd).	Semantic Scholar
By showing that a family of approximating neural networks gives rise to an encoder for Eβ(Rd), we then prove that one cannot approximate a general function f∈Eβ(Rd) using neural networks that are less complex than those produced by our construction.	Semantic Scholar
In addition to the optimality in terms of the number of weights, we show that in order to achieve this optimal approximation rate, one needs ReLU networks of a certain minimal depth.	Semantic Scholar
Precisely, for piecewise Cβ(Rd) functions, this minimal depth is given - up to a multiplicative constant - by β∕d.	Semantic Scholar
Up to a log factor, our constructed networks match this bound.	Semantic Scholar
This partly explains the benefits of depth for ReLU networks by showing that deep networks are necessary to achieve efficient approximation of (piecewise) smooth functions.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we analyze approximation in high-dimensional spaces where the function f to be approximated can be factorized into a smooth dimension reducing feature map τ and classifier function g - defined on a low-dimensional feature space - as f=g∘τ.	Semantic Scholar
We show that in this case the approximation rate depends only on the dimension of the feature space and not the input dimension.	Semantic Scholar

In this letter, we present a new robotic harvester (Harvey) that can autonomously harvest sweet pepper in protected cropping environments.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach combines effective vision algorithms with a novel end-effector design to enable successful harvesting of sweet peppers.	Semantic Scholar
Initial field trials in protected cropping environments, with two cultivar, demonstrate the efficacy of this approach achieving a 46% success rate for unmodified crop, and 58% for modified crop.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, for the more favourable cultivar we were also able to detach 90% of sweet peppers, indicating that improvements in the grasping success rate would result in greatly improved harvesting performance.	Semantic Scholar

Handwritten digits recognition is a challenging problem in recent years.	Semantic Scholar
Although many deep learning-based classification algorithms are studied for handwritten digits recognition, the recognition accuracy and running time still need to be further improved.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, an adaptive deep Q-learning strategy is proposed to improve accuracy and shorten running time for handwritten digit recognition.	Semantic Scholar
The adaptive deep Q-learning strategy combines the feature-extracting capability of deep learning and the decision-making of reinforcement learning to form an adaptive Q-learning deep belief network (Q-ADBN).	Semantic Scholar
First, Q-ADBN extracts the features of original images using an adaptive deep auto-encoder (ADAE), and the extracted features are considered as the current states of Q-learning algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Second, Q-ADBN receives Q-function (reward signal) during recognition of the current states, and the final handwritten digits recognition is implemented by maximizing the Q-function using Q-learning algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, experimental results from the well-known MNIST dataset show that the proposed Q-ADBN has a superiority to other similar methods in terms of accuracy and running time.	Semantic Scholar
We present fundamental progress on parallel self-assembly using large swarms of microscale particles in complex environments, controlled not by individual navigation, but by a uniform, global, external force with the same effect on each particle.	Semantic Scholar
Consider a 2-D grid world, in which all obstacles and particles are unit squares, and for each actuation, particles move maximally until they collide with an obstacle or another particle.	Semantic Scholar
We present algorithms that, given an arbitrary 2-D structure, design an obstacle layout.	Semantic Scholar
When actuated, this layout generates copies of the input 2-D structure.	Semantic Scholar
We analyze the movement and spatial complexity of the factory layouts.	Semantic Scholar
We present hardware results on both a macroscale, gravity-based system, and a microscale, magnetically actuated system.	Semantic Scholar
A robot introduced into an animal group, accepted by the animals as conspecifics, and capable of interacting with them is a very efficient tool for ethological research, particularly in studies of collective and social behavior.	Semantic Scholar

We discuss the design of the robot and of the experimental setup that we built to run animal-robot experiments.	Semantic Scholar
The robot design was experimentally validated, it was demonstrated that the robot can be socially integrated into animal groups.	Semantic Scholar
The designed system opens new opportunities in the study of behavior in domestic fowl by using mobile robots.	Semantic Scholar
Being socially integrated into the animal group, mobile robots can profit from the positive feedback mechanism that plays key roles in animal collective behavior.	Semantic Scholar
They have potential applications in various domains, from pure scientific research to applied areas such as control and ensuring welfare of poultry.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we derive an algorithm for enabling a single robotic unmanned aerial vehicle to herd a flock of birds away from a designated volume of space, such as the air space around an airport.	Semantic Scholar
The herding algorithm, referred to as the $m$-waypoint algorithm, is designed using a dynamic model of bird flocking based on Reynolds’ rules.	Semantic Scholar
We derive bounds on its performance using a combination of reduced-order modeling of the flock's motion, heuristics, and rigorous analysis.	Semantic Scholar
A unique contribution of the paper is the experimental demonstration of several facets of the herding algorithm on flocks of live birds reacting to a robotic pursuer.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments allow us to estimate several parameters of the flocking model, and especially the interaction between the pursuer and the flock.	Semantic Scholar
The herding algorithm is also demonstrated using numerical simulations.	Semantic Scholar
Traditional rigid robotic arms have been widely used in various industries.	Semantic Scholar
They own the merits of high force output, precise control, and high efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
However, a rigid robotic arm is seldom used by people in daily life, as the cost is usually high and, most importantly, its rigidity, large weight, and noncompliance can cause safety concerns when it comes to human–robot interaction.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we want to build a robotic arm that is cheap, lightweight, and provides safe interaction with humans.	Semantic Scholar
This soft inflatable robotic arm, which is made from low-cost fabrics and flexible plastics, is a promising solution for a domestic robotic arm.	Semantic Scholar
The softness and natural compliance can guarantee safe interaction with people.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present our soft robotic arm (SRA) made from nylon fabric.	Semantic Scholar
The SRA contains two joints that can bend the arm vertically and horizontally, and a gripper as an end-effector that can pick up objects of different shapes and sizes.	Semantic Scholar
The SRA has the advantages of low cost, good portability, and adequate force output.	Semantic Scholar
We characterized the bending modality and force output and demonstrated the functionality of the SRA in object manipulation.	Semantic Scholar
This fabric-based soft robotic arm is promising for use in assisting people's daily activities, for example, mounting on a wheelchair to enable a wheelchair bound person to reach objects from a distance.	Semantic Scholar
Mobile ground robots operating on unstructured terrain must predict which areas of the environment they are able to pass in order to plan feasible paths.	Semantic Scholar
We address traversability estimation as a heightmap classification problem: we build a convolutional neural network that, given an image representing the heightmap of a terrain patch, predicts whether the robot will be able to traverse such patch from left to right.	Semantic Scholar
The classifier is trained for a specific robot model (wheeled, tracked, legged, snake-like) using simulation data on procedurally generated training terrains; the trained classifier can be applied to unseen large heightmaps to yield oriented traversability maps, and then plan traversable paths.	Semantic Scholar
We extensively evaluate the approach in simulation on six real-world elevation dataset, and run a real-robot validation in one indoor and one outdoor environment.	Semantic Scholar
The variational auto-encoder (VAE) is a powerful and scalable deep generative model.	Semantic Scholar
Under the architecture of VAE, the choice of the approximate posterior distribution is one of the crucial issues, and it has a significant impact on tractability and flexibility of the VAE.	Semantic Scholar
Generally, latent variables are assumed to be normally distributed with a diagonal covariance matrix, however, it is not flexible enough to match the true complex posterior distribution.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce a novel approach to design a flexible and arbitrarily complex approximate posterior distribution.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike VAE, firstly, an initial density is constructed by a Gaussian mixture model, and each component has a diagonal covariance matrix.	Semantic Scholar
Then this relatively simple distribution is transformed into a more flexible one by applying a sequence of invertible Householder transformations until the desired complexity has been achieved.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, we also give a detailed theoretical and geometric interpretation of Householder transformations.	Semantic Scholar
Lastly, due to this change of approximate posterior distribution, the Kullback-Leibler distance between two mixture densities is required to be calculated, but it has no closed form solution.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we redefine a new variational lower bound by virtue of its upper bound.	Semantic Scholar
Compared with other generative models based on similar VAE architecture, our method achieves new state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, Omniglot and Histopathology data a more challenging medical images dataset, the experimental results show that our method can improve the flexibility of posterior distribution more effectively.

Our technique features dexterous manipulation actions that combine into a complete insertion operation, as also commonly demonstrated by humans performing the battery insertion task.	Semantic Scholar
The quasistatic stability of the presented insertion process is shown by constructing the space of force-closure grasps and manipulation primitives to navigate the space by changing the grasps.	Semantic Scholar

In this paper, we present a novel procedure for constructing a topological map of an unknown environment from data collected by a swarm of robots with limited sensing capabilities and no communication or global localization.	Semantic Scholar
Topological maps are sparse roadmap representations of environments that can be used to identify collision-free trajectories for robots to navigate through a domain.	Semantic Scholar
Our method uses uncertain position data obtained by robots during the course of random exploration to construct a probability function over the explored region that indicates the presence of obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
Techniques from topological data analysis, in particular the concept of persistent homology, are applied to the probability map to segment the obstacle regions.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, a graph-based wave propagation algorithm is applied to the obstacle-free region to construct the topological map of the domain in the form of an approximate generalized Voronoi diagram.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a variety of simulated domains and in multirobot experiments on a domain with two obstacles.	Semantic Scholar

The overarching vision of TGDS is to introduce scientific consistency as an essential component for learning generalizable models.	Semantic Scholar
Further, by producing scientifically interpretable models, TGDS aims to advance our scientific understanding by discovering novel domain insights.	Semantic Scholar
Indeed, the paradigm of TGDS has started to gain prominence in a number of scientific disciplines such as turbulence modeling, material discovery, quantum chemistry, bio-medical science, bio-marker discovery, climate science, and hydrology.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we formally conceptualize the paradigm of TGDS and present a taxonomy of research themes in TGDS.	Semantic Scholar
We describe several approaches for integrating domain knowledge in different research themes using illustrative examples from different disciplines.	Semantic Scholar
We also highlight some of the promising avenues of novel research for realizing the full potential of theory-guided data science.	Semantic Scholar
Multicamera tracking of humans and animals in outdoor environments is a relevant and challenging problem.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach to it involves a team of cooperating microaerial vehicles (MAVs) with on-board cameras only.	Semantic Scholar
Deep neural networks (DNNs) often fail at detecting small-scale objects or those that are far away from the camera, which are typical characteristics of a scenario with aerial robots.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, the core problem addressed in this letter is how to achieve on-board, online, continuous, and accurate vision-based detections using DNNs for visual person tracking through MAVs.	Semantic Scholar
Our solution leverages cooperation among multiple MAVs and active selection of most informative regions of image.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach through simulations with up to 16 robots and real-robot experiments involving two aerial robots tracking a person, while maintaining an active perception-driven formation.	Semantic Scholar

Explaining causal reasoning in the form of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) yields nodal structures with multivariate relationships.	Semantic Scholar
In real-world phenomena, these effects can be seen as multiple feature dependency with unmeasured external influences or noises.	Semantic Scholar
The bivariate models for causal discovery simply miss to find the multiple feature dependency criteria in the causal models.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we propose a multivariate additive noise model (MANM) to solve these issues while analyzing and presenting a multi-nodal causal structure.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce new criteria of causal independence for qualitative analysis of causal models and causal influence factor (CIF) for the successful discovery of causal directions in the multivariate system.	Semantic Scholar
The scores of CIF provide the information for the goodness of casual inference.	Semantic Scholar
The identifiability of the proposed model to discover linear, non-linear causal relations is verified in simulated, real-world datasets and the ability to construct the complete causal model.	Semantic Scholar
In comparison test, MANM has out performed Independent Component Analysis based Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model (ICA-LiNGAM), Greedy DAG Search (GDS) and Regression with Sub-sequent Independent Test (RESIT), and performed better for Gaussian and non-Gaussian mixture models with both correlated and uncorrelated feature relations.	Semantic Scholar
In performance test, different model fitting errors which occur during causal model construction are discussed and the performance of MANM in comparison to ICA-LiNGAM, GDS and RESIT is provided.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that MANM has better causal model construction ability, producing few extra sets of direction with no missing or wrong directions and can estimate every possible causal direction in complex feature sets.	Semantic Scholar

We also present an underactuated prototype, demonstrating the versatility of our design and actuation methods.	Semantic Scholar
Robots that exploit their embodiment promise to be more robust, energy-efficient, and adaptable.	Semantic Scholar
However, the majority of systems designed in this way are only capable of exploiting their embodiment when performing a single task in a single environment.	Semantic Scholar
For such robots to be capable of adapting to a range of tasks or environments, they must be capable of adjusting their morphology online and have an understanding of how adjustments in both control and morphology affect their behavior.	Semantic Scholar

This system allows us to perform an initial investigation into how navigating the CM space affects the behavior of a robot.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the behavior of the system is not only the result of selecting a particular location within the CM space, but also the route taken to arrive at that point.	Semantic Scholar
We also demonstrate locations within the space where a shift in behavior can be caused entirely by smooth online changes in morphology.	Semantic Scholar

Based on the concept of random frequency modulation, gaussian linear state-space models for oscillation components are developed.	Semantic Scholar
In this model, the frequency of an oscillator fluctuates by noise.	Semantic Scholar
Time series decomposition is accomplished by this model like the Bayesian seasonal adjustment method.	Semantic Scholar
Since the model parameters are estimated from data by the empirical Bayes’ method, the amplitudes and the frequencies of oscillation components are determined in a data-driven manner.	Semantic Scholar
Also, the appropriate number of oscillation components is determined with the Akaike information criterion (AIC).	Semantic Scholar
In this way, the proposed method provides a natural decomposition of the given time series into oscillation components.	Semantic Scholar
In neuroscience, the phase of neural time series plays an important role in neural information processing.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method can be used to estimate the phase of each oscillation component and has several advantages over a conventional method based on the Hilbert transform.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, the proposed method enables an investigation of the phase dynamics of time series.	Semantic Scholar

In the field of rehabilitation robots and human support robot, exoskeleton robots have been widely studied both for upper and lower limbs.	Semantic Scholar
Applying the exoskeleton to a wrist joint remains challenging because the wrist has two degrees of freedom in a structure smaller than the structures of other upper and lower limb joints and the center of rotation moves according to motion owing to the complex anatomical structure.	Semantic Scholar
To tackle this problem, we developed a wrist exoskeleton mechanism that consists of two elastic elements that largely deform during motion in transmitting forces from two linear actuators implemented on the user's forearm and in transforming the forces to wrist flexion/extension and adduction/abduction.

We develop a support system for indoor use that depends on the user's state, such as sitting or standing.	Semantic Scholar
Although it is useful for assistive devices to be able to select how to support users based on sensor data, it is difficult to utilize many expensive and sophisticated sensors for accurate estimation of the user's state.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we propose an estimation method of the user's state utilizing a few inexpensive and simple sensors.	Semantic Scholar
First, we propose the method to calculate the CoG candidates using a human link model.	Semantic Scholar
The CoG candidates are then used to develop a state estimation method for sit-to-stand motion; this motion consists of three contiguous states: sitting, rising, and standing.	Semantic Scholar
A support vector machine is used to estimate the user state and the methods were experimentally validated using the developed assistive robot.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results show that the estimations are correct except in the vicinities of state transitions.	Semantic Scholar
The average state transition time errors are 0.175 and 0.145 s for sit-to-rise and rise-to-stand, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
Since sit-to-stand motion is contiguous, the user's state is ambiguous and can be both states at the boundaries.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, the accuracy of the state estimation is reasonable.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a new method for picking objects through quasistatic in-hand manipulation with end-effectors that have no degrees of freedom.	Semantic Scholar
Our stable manipulation/grasp planning is achieved with two contacts at fixed distance and the force of gravity, and is provably complete and correct.	Semantic Scholar
Practically, our robotic in-hand manipulation technique can facilitate low-cost manipulation and render simple end-effectors such as the parallel-jaw gripper more dexterous in picking, placing, and handing-off objects in case, for example, failing actuated grippers become frozen and it is impossible to exert sufficiently large internal forces.	Semantic Scholar
Our picking technique can also be applied to placing objects.	Semantic Scholar
Implementation and experimentation on a custom-made direct-drive manipulator and a conventional manipulator are presented.	Semantic Scholar
Many experiments were performed for both picking and placing and the results demonstrate usefulness of this method for manipulating a variety of common objects, with different geometries and surface conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Sports video research is a popular topic that has been applied to many prominent sports for a large spectrum of applications.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we introduce a technology platform which has been developed for the tennis context, able to extract action sequences and provide support to coaches for players performance analysis during training and official matches.	Semantic Scholar
The system consists of an hardware architecture, devised to acquire data in the tennis context and for the specific domain requirements, and a number of processing modules which are able to track both the ball and the players, to extract semantic information from their interactions and automatically annotate video sequences.	Semantic Scholar
The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that the proposed combination of hardware and software modules is able to extract 3D ball trajectories robust enough to evaluate ball changes of direction recognizing serves, strokes and bounces.	Semantic Scholar
Starting from these information, a finite state machine based decision process can be employed to evaluate the score of each action of the game.	Semantic Scholar
The entire platform has been tested in real experiments during both training sessions and matches, and results show that automatic annotation of key events along with 3D positions and scores can be used to support coaches in the extraction of valuable information about players intentions and behaviours.

We study content-based learning to rank from the perspective of learning distance functions.	Semantic Scholar
Standardly, the two key issues of learning to rank, feature mappings and score functions, are usually modeled separately, and the learning is usually restricted to modeling a linear distance function such as the Mahalanobis distance.	Semantic Scholar
However, the modeling of feature mappings and score functions are mutually interacted, and the patterns underlying the data are probably complicated and nonlinear.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, as a general nonlinear distance family, the Bregman distance is a suitable distance function for learning to rank, due to its strong generalization ability for distance functions, and its nonlinearity for exploring the general patterns of data distributions.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study learning to rank as a structural learning problem, and devise a Bregman distance function to build the ranking model based on structural SVM.	Semantic Scholar
To improve the model robustness to outliers, we develop a robust structural learning framework for the ranking model.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed model Robust Structural Bregman distance functions Learning to Rank (RSBLR) is a general and unified framework for learning distance functions to rank.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments of data ranking on real-world datasets show the superiority of this method to the state-of-the-art literature, as well as its robustness to the noisily labeled outliers.	Semantic Scholar
The possibility of using a quantum computer D-Wave 2X with more than 1000 qubits to determine the global minimum of the energy landscape of trained restricted Boltzmann machines is investigated.	Semantic Scholar
In order to overcome the problem of limited interconnectivity in the D-Wave architecture, the proposed RBM embedding combines multiple qubits to represent a particular RBM unit.	Semantic Scholar
The results for the lowest-energy (the ground state) and some of the higher-energy states found by the D-Wave 2X were compared with those of the classical simulated annealing (SA) algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
In many cases, the D-Wave machine successfully found the same RBM lowest-energy state as that found by SA.	Semantic Scholar
In some examples, the D-Wave machine returned a state corresponding to one of the higher-energy local minima found by SA.	Semantic Scholar
The inherently nonperfect embedding of the RBM into the Chimera lattice explored in this work (i.e., multiple qubits combined into a single RBM unit were found not to be guaranteed to be all aligned) and the existence of small, persistent biases in the D-Wave hardware may cause a discrepancy between the D-Wave and the SA results.	Semantic Scholar
In some of the investigated cases, introduction of a small bias field into the energy function or optimization of the chain-strength parameter in the D-Wave embedding successfully addressed difficulties of the particular RBM embedding.	Semantic Scholar
With further development of the D-Wave hardware, the approach will be suitable for much larger numbers of RBM units.	Semantic Scholar
Stairs are one of the most common structures present in human-made scenarios, but also one of the most dangerous for those with vision problems.	Semantic Scholar
In this work we propose a complete method to detect, locate and parametrise stairs with a wearable RGB-D camera.	Semantic Scholar
Our algorithm uses the depth data to determine if the horizontal planes in the scene are valid steps of a staircase judging their dimensions and relative positions.	Semantic Scholar
As a result we obtain a scaled model of the staircase with the spatial location and orientation with respect to the subject.	Semantic Scholar
The visual odometry is also estimated to continuously recover the current position and orientation of the user while moving.	Semantic Scholar
This enhances the system giving the ability to come back to previously detected features and providing location awareness of the user during the climb.	Semantic Scholar
Simultaneously, the detection of the staircase during the traversal is used to correct the drift of the visual odometry.	Semantic Scholar
A comparison of results of the stair detection with other state-of-the-art algorithms was performed using public dataset.	Semantic Scholar
Additional experiments have also been carried out, recording our own natural scenes with a chest-mounted RGB-D camera in indoor scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm is robust enough to work in real-time and even under partial occlusions of the stair.	Semantic Scholar
The emergence of assistive robots presents the possibility of restoring vital degrees of independence to the elderly and impaired in activities of daily living (ADL).	Semantic Scholar
However, one of the main challenges is the lack of a means for effective and intuitive human–robot interaction (HRI).	Semantic Scholar
While humans can express their intentions in different ways (e.g., physical gestures or motions, or speech or language patterns), gaze-based implicit intention communication is still underdeveloped.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, a novel nonverbal implicit communication framework based on eye gaze is introduced for HRI.	Semantic Scholar
In this framework, a user's eye-gaze movements are proactively tracked and analyzed to infer the user's intention in ADL.	Semantic Scholar
Then, the inferred intention can be used to command assistive robots for proper service.	Semantic Scholar
The advantage of this framework is that gaze-based communication can be handled by most of the people, as it requires very little effort, and most of the elderly and impaired retain visual capability.	Semantic Scholar
This framework is expected to simplify HRI, consequently enhancing the adoption of assistive technologies and improving users’ independence in daily living.	Semantic Scholar
The testing results of this framework confirmed that a human's subtle gaze cues on visualized objects could be effectively used for human-intention communication.	Semantic Scholar
Results also demonstrated that the gaze-based intention communication is easy to learn and use.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, the relationship of visual behaviors with the mental process during human intention expression was studied for the first time to build a fundamental understanding of this process.	Semantic Scholar
These findings are expected to guide further design of accurate intention inference algorithms and intuitive HRI.	Semantic Scholar
This work proposes a method to segment a 3D point cloud of a scene while simultaneously reconstructing it via Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM).	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method incrementally merges segments obtained from each input depth image in an unified global model leveraging the camera pose estimated via SLAM.	Semantic Scholar
Differently from other approaches, our method is able to yield segmentation of scenes reconstructed from multiple views in real-time and with a complexity that does not depend on the size of the global model.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we endow our system with two additional contributions: a loop closure approach and a failure recovery and re-localization approach, both specifically designed so to enforce global consistency between merged segments, thus making our system suitable for large scale and long standing reconstruction and segmentation.	Semantic Scholar
We validate our proposal against the state of the art in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy on several benchmark datasets, as well as by showing how our method enables real-time reconstruction and segmentation of diverse real indoor environments.	Semantic Scholar
An operating system (OS) kernel forms the lowest level of any system software stack.	Semantic Scholar
The correctness of the OS kernel is the basis for the correctness of the entire system.	Semantic Scholar
Recent efforts have demonstrated the feasibility of building formally verified general-purpose kernels, but it is unclear how to extend their work to verify the functional correctness of device drivers, due to the non-local effects of interrupts.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a novel compositional framework for building certified interruptible OS kernels with device drivers.	Semantic Scholar
We provide a general device model that can be instantiated with various hardware devices, and a realistic formal model of interrupts, which can be used to reason about interruptible code.	Semantic Scholar
We have realized this framework in the Coq proof assistant.	Semantic Scholar
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our new approach, we have successfully extended an existing verified non-interruptible kernel with our framework and turned it into an interruptible kernel with verified device drivers.	Semantic Scholar
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first verified interruptible operating system with device drivers.	Semantic Scholar
The success of myoelectric pattern recognition (M-PR) mostly relies on the features extracted and classifier employed.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes and evaluates a fast classifier, extreme learning machine (ELM), to classify individual and combined finger movements on amputees and non-amputees.	Semantic Scholar
ELM is a single hidden layer feed-forward network (SLFN) that avoids iterative learning by determining input weights randomly and output weights analytically.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, it can accelerate the training time of SLFNs.	Semantic Scholar
In addition to the classifier evaluation, this paper evaluates various feature combinations to improve the performance of M-PR and investigate some feature projections to improve the class separability of the features.	Semantic Scholar
Different from other studies on the implementation of ELM in the myoelectric controller, this paper presents a complete and thorough investigation of various types of ELMs including the node-based and kernel-based ELM.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, this paper provides comparisons of ELMs and other well-known classifiers such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbour (kNN), support vector machine (SVM) and least-square SVM (LS-SVM).	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results show the most accurate ELM classifier is radial basis function ELM (RBF-ELM).	Semantic Scholar
The comparison of RBF-ELM and other well-known classifiers shows that RBF-ELM is as accurate as SVM and LS-SVM but faster than the SVM family; it is superior to LDA and kNN.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results also indicate that the accuracy gap of the M-PR on the amputees and non-amputees is not too much with the accuracy of 98.55% on amputees and 99.5% on the non-amputees using six electromyography (EMG) channels.	Semantic Scholar
Representing and managing temporal knowledge, in the form of temporal constraints, is a crucial task in many areas, including knowledge representation, planning, and scheduling.	Semantic Scholar
The current literature in the area is moving from the treatment of “crisp” temporal constraints to fuzzy or probabilistic constraints, to account for preferences and\or uncertainty.	Semantic Scholar
Given a set of temporal constraints, the evaluation of the <italic>tightest</italic> implied constraints is a fundamental task, which is essential also to provide <italic>reliable query-answering facilities</italic>.	Semantic Scholar
However, while such tasks have been widely addressed for “crisp” temporal constraints, they have not attracted enough attention in the “non-crisp” context yet.	Semantic Scholar
We overcome such a limitation, by (i) extending quantitative temporal constraints to cope with <italic>preferences</italic>, (ii) defining a <italic>temporal reasoning algorithm</italic> which evaluates the <italic>tightest</italic> temporal constraints, and (iii) providing suitable <italic>query-answering facilities</italic> based on it.

This work studies rearrangement problems involving the sorting of robots or objects in stack-like containers, which can be accessed only from one side.	Semantic Scholar
Two scenarios are considered: one where every robot or object needs to reach a particular stack, and a setting in which each robot has a distinct position within a stack.	Semantic Scholar
In both cases, the goal is to minimize the number of stack removals that need to be performed.	Semantic Scholar
Stack rearrangement is shown to be intimately connected to pebble motion problems, a useful abstraction in multi-robot path planning.	Semantic Scholar
Through this connection, feasibility of stack rearrangement can be readily addressed.	Semantic Scholar
Lower and upper bounds on optimality are established, which differ only by a logarithmic factor, in terms of stack removals.	Semantic Scholar
An algorithmic solution is then developed that produces suboptimal paths much quicker than a pebble motion solver.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, informed search-based methods are proposed for finding high-quality solutions.	Semantic Scholar
The efficiency and desirable scalability of the methods are demonstrated in simulation.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a robust Gaussian mixture model registration technique to enable mapping and navigation in dark, complex, unstructured domains such as caves and mines.	Semantic Scholar
Subterranean environments are often unmapped and challenged by low-lighting conditions and communication constraints.	Semantic Scholar
Prior works that leverage direct and image-based techniques with active illumination fail when taking tight turns due to sensor washout, dense methods are sensitive to initialization, and state-of-the-art registration methods that leverage probabilistic models are neither real-time viable nor thoroughly evaluated with real-world data.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach minimizes the squared L2 norm between two distributions through an on-manifold parameterization of the objective function.	Semantic Scholar
The contribution of this letter is a robust, real-time viable distribution-to-distribution registration methodology that considers all possible correspondences between mixture components.	Semantic Scholar
The approach is evaluated in a feature-scarce mine, unstructured cave, and on open-source data of an office environment with both light detection and ranging (LIDAR) and depth sensors.	Semantic Scholar
The results demonstrate superior performance as compared to the state of the art.	Semantic Scholar
Beyond cave and mine environments, the method readily extends to solving the problem of registration in cluttered domains.	Semantic Scholar
The evaluation of driver's steering comfort, which is mainly concerned with the haptic driver–vehicle interaction, is important for the optimization of advanced driver assistance systems.	Semantic Scholar
The current approaches to investigating steering comfort are mainly based on the driver's subjective evaluation, which is time-consuming, expensive, and easily influenced by individual variations.	Semantic Scholar
This paper makes some tentative investigation of objective evaluation, which is based on the electromyogram (EMG) and movement trajectory of the driver's upper limbs during steering maneuvers.	Semantic Scholar
First, a steering experiment with 21 subjects is conducted, and EMG and movement trajectories of the driver's upper limbs are measured, together with their subjective evaluation of steering comfort.	Semantic Scholar
Second, five evaluation indices including EMG and movement information are defined based on the measurements from the first step.	Semantic Scholar
Correlation analyses are conducted between each evaluation index and steering comfort rating (SCR), and the results show that all of the indices have significant correlations with SCR.	Semantic Scholar
Then, an artificial neural network model is devised based on the aforementioned indices and its predicting performance of SCR is demonstrated as acceptable.	Semantic Scholar
The results reveal that it may be feasible to establish an objective evaluation approach for vehicle steering comfort.	Semantic Scholar
Lifelong autonomous operation has gained much attention in the field of mobile robotics in recent years.	Semantic Scholar
In the context of robot navigation based on vision, lifelong applications include scenarios with substantial perceptual changes due to changes in season, illumination and weather.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present an approach to localize a mobile robot, equipped with a low frequency camera, with respect to an image sequence recorded in a different season.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach employs a discrete Bayes filter with a sensor model based on whole image descriptors.	Semantic Scholar
We compute a similarity matrix over all image descriptors and leverage the sequential nature of typical image streams with a flexible transition scheme in the Bayes filter framework.	Semantic Scholar
Since we compute a probability distribution over the entire state space, our approach can handle complex trajectories that may include same season loop-closures as well as fragmented sub-sequences.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we show that decorrelating the similarity matrix results in an improved localization performance.	Semantic Scholar
Through an extensive experimental evaluation on challenging datasets we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-theart techniques.	Semantic Scholar
Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is primarily a linear dimensionality reduction technique that factorizes a nonnegative data matrix into two smaller nonnegative matrices: one that represents the basis of the new subspace and the second that holds the coefficients of all the data points in that new space.	Semantic Scholar
In principle, the nonnegativity constraint forces the representation to be sparse and parts based.	Semantic Scholar
Instead of extracting holistic features from the data, real parts are extracted that should be significantly easier to interpret and analyze.	Semantic Scholar
The size of the new subspace selects how many features will be extracted from the data.	Semantic Scholar
An effective choice should minimize the noise while extracting the key features.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a mechanism for selecting the subspace size by using a minimum description length technique.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate that our technique provides plausible estimates for real data as well as accurately predicting the known size of synthetic data.	Semantic Scholar
We provide an implementation of our code in a Matlab format.	Semantic Scholar
Object handover is a common physical interaction between humans.	Semantic Scholar
It is thus also of significant interest for human–robot interaction.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we are focused on robot-to-human object handover.	Semantic Scholar
The main challenge in this case is how to reduce the failure rate, i.e., to ensure that the object does not fall (object safety), while at the same time allowing the human to easily acquire the object (smoothness).	Semantic Scholar
To endow the robot with a failure recovery mechanism, we investigated how humans detect failure during the transfer phase of the handover.	Semantic Scholar
We conducted a human study that showed that a human giver primarily relies on vision rather than haptic sensing to detect the fall of the object.	Semantic Scholar
Motivated by this study, a robotic handover system is proposed that consists of a motion sensor attached to the robot's gripper, a force sensor at the base of the gripper, and a controller that is capable of regrasping the object if it starts falling.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed system is implemented on a Baxter robot and is shown to achieve a smooth and safe handover.	Semantic Scholar
Two core competencies of a mobile robot are to build a map of the environment and to estimate its own pose on the basis of this map and incoming sensor readings.	Semantic Scholar
To account for the uncertainties in this process, one typically employs probabilistic state estimation approaches combined with a model of the specific sensor.	Semantic Scholar
Over the past years, lidar sensors have become a popular choice for mapping and localization.	Semantic Scholar
However, many common lidar models perform poorly in unstructured, unpredictable environments, they lack a consistent physical model for both mapping and localization, and they do not exploit all the information the sensor provides, e.g.	Semantic Scholar
out-of-range measurements.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we introduce a consistent physical model that can be applied to mapping as well as to localization.	Semantic Scholar
It naturally deals with unstructured environments and makes use of both out-of-range measurements and information about the ray path.	Semantic Scholar
The approach can be seen as a generalization of the well-established reflection model, but in addition to counting ray reflections and traversals in a specific map cell, it considers the distances that all rays travel inside this cell.	Semantic Scholar
We prove that the resulting map maximizes the data likelihood and demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art sensor models in extensive real-world experiments.	Semantic Scholar

In this letter, we first theoretically prove the conditions and boundaries of resolution completeness for deterministic roadmap methods with a discretized workspace.	Semantic Scholar
A novel variant of such methods, the hierarchical dynamic roadmap (HDRM), is then proposed for solving complex planning problems.	Semantic Scholar
A unique hierarchical structure to efficiently encode the configuration-to-workspace occupation information is introduced and allows the robot to check the collision state of tens of millions of samples on-the-fly—the number of which was previously strictly limited by available memory.	Semantic Scholar
The hierarchical structure also significantly reduces the time for path searching, hence, the robot is able to find feasible motion plans in real-time in extremely constrained environments.	Semantic Scholar
A rigorous benchmarking shows that HDRM is robust and computationally fast compared with classical dynamic roadmap methods and other state-of-the-art planning algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on the seven degree-of-freedom KUKA LWR robotic arm integrated with live perception further validate the effectiveness of HDRM in complex environments.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents the development and evaluation of concurrent control of a robotic system for less-invasive treatment of osteolytic lesions behind an acetabular implant.	Semantic Scholar
This system implements safety constraints including a remote center of motion, virtual walls, and joint limits while operating through the screw holes of the acetabular implant.	Semantic Scholar
The formulated linear constrained optimization problem ensures these constraints are satisfied while maintaining precise control of the tip of a Continuum Dexterous Manipulator attached to a positioning robot.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments evaluated the performance of the tip control method within an acetabular cup.	Semantic Scholar
The controller reliably reached a series of goal points with a mean error of 0.42 mm and a worst-case error of straying 1.0 mm from our path.	Semantic Scholar

Optimization Modulo Theories ( $$\text {OMT}$$ OMT ) is an extension of SMT which allows for finding models that optimize given objectives.	Semantic Scholar
OptiMathSAT is an OMT solver which allows for solving a list of optimization problems on SMT formulas with linear objective functions—on the Boolean, the rational and the integer domains, and on their combination thereof—including (partial weighted) MaxSMT .	Semantic Scholar
Multiple and heterogeneous objective functions can be combined together and handled either independently, or lexicographically, or in linear or min–max /max–min combinations.	Semantic Scholar
OptiMathSAT provides an incremental interface, it supports both an extended version of the SMT-LIBv2 language and a subset of the FlatZinc language, and can be interfaced via an API.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we describe OptiMathSAT and its usage in full detail.	Semantic Scholar
Brain activity evolves through time, creating trajectories of activity that underlie sensorimotor processing, behavior, and learning and memory.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, understanding the temporal nature of neural dynamics is essential to understanding brain function and behavior.	Semantic Scholar
In vivo studies have demonstrated that sequential transient activation of neurons can encode time.	Semantic Scholar
However, it remains unclear whether these patterns emerge from feedforward network architectures or from recurrent networks and, furthermore, what role network structure plays in timing.	Semantic Scholar
We address these issues using a recurrent neural network (RNN) model with distinct populations of excitatory and inhibitory units.	Semantic Scholar
Consistent with experimental data, a single RNN could autonomously produce multiple functionally feedforward trajectories, thus potentially encoding multiple timed motor patterns lasting up to several seconds.	Semantic Scholar
Importantly, the model accounted for Weber's law, a hallmark of timing behavior.	Semantic Scholar
Analysis of network connectivity revealed that efficiency—a measure of network interconnectedness—decreased as the number of stored trajectories increased.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, the balance of excitation (E) and inhibition (I) shifted toward excitation during each unit's activation time, generating the prediction that observed sequential activity relies on dynamic control of the E/I balance.	Semantic Scholar
Our results establish for the first time that the same RNN can generate multiple functionally feedforward patterns of activity as a result of dynamic shifts in the E/I balance imposed by the connectome of the RNN.	Semantic Scholar
We conclude that recurrent network architectures account for sequential neural activity, as well as for a fundamental signature of timing behavior: Weber's law.	Semantic Scholar
Most current textual reasoning models cannotlearn human-like reasoning process, and thus lack interpretability and logical accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
To help address this issue, we propose a novel reasoning model which learns to activate logic rules explicitly via deep reinforcement learning.	Semantic Scholar
"It takes the form of Memory Networks but features a special memory that stores relational tuples, mimicking the ""Image Schema"" in human cognitive activities."	Semantic Scholar
We redefine textual reasoning as a sequential decision-making process modifying or retrieving from the memory, where logic rules serve as state-transition functions.	Semantic Scholar
Activating logic rules for reasoning involves two problems: variable binding and relation activating, and this is a first step to solve them jointly.	Semantic Scholar
Our model achieves an average error rate of 0.7% on bAbI-20, a widely-used synthetic reasoning benchmark, using less than 1k training samples and no supporting facts.	Semantic Scholar

The problem of target tracking with multiple robots consists of actively planning the motion of the robots to track the targets.	Semantic Scholar
A major challenge for practical deployments is to make the robots resilient to failures.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, robots may be attacked in adversarial scenarios, or their sensors may fail or get occluded.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we introduce planning algorithms for multi-target tracking that are resilient to such failures.	Semantic Scholar
In general, resilient target tracking is computationally hard.	Semantic Scholar
Contrary to the case where there are no failures, no scalable approximation algorithms are known for resilient target tracking when the targets are indistinguishable, or unknown in number, or with unknown motion model.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we provide the first such algorithm, which also has the following properties: First, it achieves maximal resiliency, since the algorithm is valid for any number of failures.	Semantic Scholar
Second, it is scalable, as our algorithm terminates with the same running time as state-of-the-art algorithms for (non-resilient) target tracking.	Semantic Scholar
Third, it provides provable approximation bounds on the tracking performance, since our algorithm guarantees a solution that is guaranteed to be close to the optimal.	Semantic Scholar
We quantify our algorithm's approximation performance using a novel notion of curvature for monotone set functions subject to matroid constraints.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm through MATLAB and Gazebo simulations and a sensitivity analysis; we focus on scenarios that involve a known number of distinguishable targets.	Semantic Scholar
Building contextual models for new “smart” environments is not considered cost effective if data for model training must be collected from scratch.	Semantic Scholar
It is more practical to transfer as much learned knowledge as possible from an existing environment to the new target environment in order to reduce the data collection effort.	Semantic Scholar
In order to reuse learned knowledge from an original environment, this study proposed a feature-based knowledge transfer framework.	Semantic Scholar
The framework makes use of transfer learning, which relaxes the constraint requiring model training and testing datasets to be highly similar in distribution.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that this framework can successfully help extract and transfer knowledge between two different smart-home environments.	Semantic Scholar
Models trained via the proposed framework can even outperform nontransfer-learning models by up to 8% in accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the flexibility of the proposed framework enables used as a test bed for evaluating different methods and models in order to improve the service quality of human-centric context-aware applications.	Semantic Scholar
In this work we focus on the problem of colorization for image compression.	Semantic Scholar
Since color information occupies a large proportion of the total storage size of an image, a method that can predict accurate color from its grayscale version can produce a dramatic reduction in image file size.	Semantic Scholar
But colorization for compression poses several challenges.	Semantic Scholar
First, while colorization for artistic purposes simply involves predicting plausible chroma, colorization for compression requires generating output colors that are as close as possible to the ground truth.	Semantic Scholar
Second, many objects in the real world exhibit multiple possible colors.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, in order to disambiguate the colorization problem some additional information must be stored to reproduce the true colors with good accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
To account for the multimodal color distribution of objects we propose a deep tree-structured network that generates for every pixel multiple color hypotheses, as opposed to a single color produced by most prior colorization approaches.	Semantic Scholar
We show how to leverage the multimodal output of our model to reproduce with high fidelity the true colors of an image by storing very little additional information.	Semantic Scholar
In the experiments we show that our proposed method outperforms traditional JPEG color coding by a large margin, producing colors that are nearly indistinguishable from the ground truth at the storage cost of just a few hundred bytes for high-resolution pictures!	Semantic Scholar
Autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs) are typically deployed for long periods of time in the ocean to monitor different physical, chemical, and biological processes.	Semantic Scholar
Given their limited energy budgets, it makes sense to consider motion plans that leverage the dynamics of the surrounding flow field so as to minimize energy usage for these vehicles.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a graph-search-based method to compute energy optimal paths for AMVs in 2-D time-varying flows.	Semantic Scholar
The novelty of the proposed algorithm lies in the use of an adaptive discretization scheme to construct the search graph.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the proposed algorithm by computing optimal energy paths using an analytical time-varying flow model and using time-varying ocean flow data provided by the Regional Ocean Model System.	Semantic Scholar
We compare the output paths with those computed via an optimal control formulation and numerically demonstrate that the proposed method can overcome problems inherent in existing fixed discretization schemes.	Semantic Scholar
Robotic walkers are assistive robotic devices that provide mobility assistance, in a domestic or clinical scenario, to individuals suffering from a gait disorder, being age related or due to injuries, surgery, or diseases.	Semantic Scholar
Walkers also provide a significant potential for lower limb rehabilitation.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a novel multimodal robotic walker platform, the ISR-AIWALKER, where innovative contributions were made both in the human–machine interface (HMI) and in a gait analysis system placed on board the platform.	Semantic Scholar
Taking into account the application potential of these devices, an effort was made to use low-cost sensors without sacrificing the overall performance of the system.	Semantic Scholar
A change was made in the HMI paradigm, moving from a force-sensing to a vision-based approach, while maintaining a natural user interaction and adding complementary safety features like correct gripping enforcement.	Semantic Scholar
To cope with the close proximity of the user's body, a multimodal sensor setup was considered.	Semantic Scholar
Using both RGB and depth map data, a kinematic model of the user's lower limbs is obtained, allowing the identification of a set of features that are used in a machine learning approach to discriminate gait asymmetries.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments made with several subjects revealed that the proposed HMI is able to correctly estimate the user intention in a natural and intuitive way.	Semantic Scholar
The gait analysis system was also evaluated and evidenced a good discrimination capability to distinguish between different gait patterns.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose an end-to-end deep architecture that jointly learns to detect obstacles and estimate their depth for MAV flight applications.	Semantic Scholar
Most of the existing approaches rely either on Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems or on depth estimation models to build three-dimensional maps and detect obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
However, for the task of avoiding obstacles this level of complexity is not required.	Semantic Scholar
Recent works have proposed multitask at its first ocurrence in the text.	Semantic Scholar
"""?> architectures to perform both scene understanding and depth estimation."	Semantic Scholar
We follow their path and propose a specific architecture to jointly estimate depth and obstacles, without the need to compute a global map, but maintaining compatibility with a global SLAM system if needed.	Semantic Scholar
The network architecture is devised to jointly exploit the information learned from the obstacle detection task, which produces reliable bounding boxes, and the depth estimation one, increasing the robustness of both to scenario changes.	Semantic Scholar
We call this architecture J-MOD2.	Semantic Scholar
We test the effectiveness of our approach with experiments on sequences with different appearance and focal lengths and compare it to SotA multitask methods that perform both semantic segmentation and depth estimation.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we show the integration in a full system using a set of simulated navigation experiments, where a micro aerial vehicle explores an unknown scenario and plans safe trajectories by using our detection model.	Semantic Scholar
Imbalance problem occurs when the majority class instances outnumber the minority class instances.	Semantic Scholar
Conventional extreme learning machine (ELM) treats all instances with same importance leading to the prediction accuracy biased towards the majority class.	Semantic Scholar
To overcome this inherent drawback, many variants of ELM have been proposed like Weighted ELM, class-specific cost regulation ELM (CCR-ELM) etc.	Semantic Scholar
to handle the class imbalance problem effectively.	Semantic Scholar
This work proposes class-specific extreme learning machine (CS-ELM), a variant of ELM for handling binary class imbalance problem more effectively.	Semantic Scholar
This work differs from weighted ELM as it does not require assigning weights to the training instances.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed work also has lower computational complexity compared to weighted ELM.	Semantic Scholar
This work uses class-specific regularization parameters.	Semantic Scholar
CCR-ELM also uses class-specific regularization parameters.	Semantic Scholar
In CCR-ELM the computation of regularization parameters does not consider class distribution and class overlap.	Semantic Scholar
This work uses class-specific regularization parameters which are computed using class distribution.	Semantic Scholar
This work also differ from CCR-ELM in the computation of the output weight, β.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed work has lower computational overhead compared to CCR-ELM.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed work is evaluated using benchmark real world imbalanced datasets downloaded from the KEEL dataset repository.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that the proposed work has better performance than weighted ELM, CCR-ELM , EFSVM, FSVM, SVM for class imbalance learning.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we consider the cooperative decision-making problem for multi-target tracking in multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems.	Semantic Scholar
The multi-UAV decision-making problem is modeled in the framework of distributed multi-agent partially observable Markov decision processes (MPOMDPs).	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, the state of the targets is represented by the joint multi-target probability distribution (JMTPD), which is estimated by a distributed information fusion strategy.	Semantic Scholar
In the information fusion process, the most accurate estimation is selected to propagate through the whole network in finite time.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a max-consensus protocol to guarantee the consistency of the JMTPD.	Semantic Scholar
It is proven that the max-consensus can be achieved in the connected communication graph after a limited number of iterations.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the consistent JMTPD, the distributed partially observable Markov decision algorithm is used to make tracking decisions.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method uses the Fisher information to bid for targets in a distributed auction.	Semantic Scholar
The bid is based upon the reward value of the individual UAV’s POMDPs, thereby removing the need to optimize the global reward in the MPOMDPs.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the cooperative decision-making approach is deployed in a simulation of a multi-target tracking problem.	Semantic Scholar
We compare our proposed algorithm with the centralized method and the greedy approach.	Semantic Scholar
The simulation results show that the proposed distributed method has a similar performance to the centralized method, and outperforms the greedy approach.	Semantic Scholar
Many real-world brain–computer interface (BCI) applications rely on single-trial classification of event-related potentials (ERPs) in EEG signals.	Semantic Scholar
However, because different subjects have different neural responses to even the same stimulus, it is very difficult to build a generic ERP classifier whose parameters fit all subjects.	Semantic Scholar
The classifier needs to be calibrated for each individual subject, using some labeled subject-specific data.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes both online and offline weighted adaptation regularization (wAR) algorithms to reduce this calibration effort, i.e., to minimize the amount of labeled subject-specific EEG data required in BCI calibration, and hence to increase the utility of the BCI system.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate using a visually evoked potential oddball task and three different EEG headsets that both online and offline wAR algorithms significantly outperform several other algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, through source domain selection, we can reduce their computational cost by about  $\text{50}\%$, making them more suitable for real-time applications.	Semantic Scholar

Individuals with lower limb amputation have a high fall risk, which could be partially due to a lack of stabilizing control in conventional prostheses.	Semantic Scholar
Inspired by walking robots, we hypothesized that modulating prosthetic ankle push-off could help improve amputee balance.	Semantic Scholar
We developed a three-dimensional walking model, found limit cycles at two speeds, and designed state-feedback controllers that made once-per-step adjustments to ankle push-off work, fore-aft and medial-lateral foot placement, and ankle roll resistance.	Semantic Scholar
To assess balance, we applied increasing levels of random changes in ground height and lateral impulses until the model fell down within 100 steps.	Semantic Scholar
Although foot placement is known to be important for balance, we found that push-off control was at least twice as effective at recovering from both disturbances at both speeds.	Semantic Scholar
Push-off work affected both fore-aft and mediolateral motions, leading to good controllability, and was particularly well suited to recovery from steps up or down.	Semantic Scholar
Our results suggest that discrete control of ankle push-off may be more important than previously thought, and may guide the design of robotic prostheses that improve balance.	Semantic Scholar
Recent studies show that the handling of thin wafers in the photovoltaic industry can lead to unacceptable yields due to cell scratching and breaking.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents the concept and design of a novel modular conveyor that is intended for handling planar fragile objects at a high speed without contact.	Semantic Scholar
Each element of the conveyor is a square block that is able to generate tilted air jets that lift and push the object in a single direction.	Semantic Scholar
Various handling functions can thus be achieved by the assembly of several blocks.	Semantic Scholar
To manage the complexity of assembling systems composed of hundreds of blocks, an automatized design methodology is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
This process gives the best topology of the conveyor that meets expected specifications such as trajectory, speed, and travel time.	Semantic Scholar
The optimization relies on the physical model of the modular system describing the motion of the object pushed by directed air jets.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental comparisons show that the simulation predicts accurately the motion of a glass wafer according to the arrangement of the blocks and the volume of air flow.	Semantic Scholar
A maximal speed of 0.3 m/s was experimentally observed and, on larger simulated conveyors, the speed of the wafer could theoretically reach 2.9 m/s.	Semantic Scholar
Faces in natural images are often occluded by a variety of objects.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a fully automated, probabilistic and occlusion-aware 3D morphable face model adaptation framework following an analysis-by-synthesis setup.	Semantic Scholar
The key idea is to segment the image into regions explained by separate models.	Semantic Scholar
Our framework includes a 3D morphable face model, a prototype-based beard model and a simple model for occlusions and background regions.	Semantic Scholar
The segmentation and all the model parameters have to be inferred from the single target image.	Semantic Scholar
Face model adaptation and segmentation are solved jointly using an expectation–maximization-like procedure.	Semantic Scholar
During the E-step, we update the segmentation and in the M-step the face model parameters are updated.	Semantic Scholar
For face model adaptation we apply a stochastic sampling strategy based on the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
For segmentation, we apply loopy belief propagation for inference in a Markov random field.	Semantic Scholar
Illumination estimation is critical for occlusion handling.	Semantic Scholar
Our combined segmentation and model adaptation needs a proper initialization of the illumination parameters.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a RANSAC-based robust illumination estimation technique.	Semantic Scholar
By applying this method to a large face image database we obtain a first empirical distribution of real-world illumination conditions.	Semantic Scholar
The obtained empirical distribution is made publicly available and can be used as prior in probabilistic frameworks, for regularization or to synthesize data for deep learning methods.	Semantic Scholar
Indoor localization systems are applicable to labyrinth-like environments where mobile and robotic operators require precise direction and location.	Semantic Scholar
Existing indoor localization systems require additional equipment, such as WiFi receivers and distributed beacons to capture the necessary information to accurately calculate direction and location.	Semantic Scholar
Image-based localization is mostly used in outdoor environments to compensate for the deficiency of weak GPS signals in large building areas.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a new indoor localization method that significantly reduces the dependency of external hardware resource by utilizing multiple-view configuration.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed algorithm initially extracts the self-similarity matrix features to represent the video that captures the user’s spatio-temporal information.	Semantic Scholar
We then perform the image and video retrieval based on the trained multi-task classifiers to determine scene location and orientation.	Semantic Scholar
Our method generates accurate location and orientation estimation.	Semantic Scholar
In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), prescriptions are the daughters of doctors’ clinical experiences, which have been the main way to cure diseases in China for several thousand years.	Semantic Scholar
In the long Chinese history, a large number of prescriptions have been invented based on TCM theories.	Semantic Scholar
Regularities in the prescriptions are important for both clinical practice and novel prescription development.	Semantic Scholar
Previous works used many methods to discover regularities in prescriptions, but rarely described how a prescription is generated using TCM theories.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we propose a topic model which characterizes the generative process of prescriptions in TCM theories and further incorporate domain knowledge into the topic model.	Semantic Scholar
Using 33,765 prescriptions in TCM prescription books, the model can reflect the prescribing patterns in TCM.	Semantic Scholar
Our method can outperform several previous topic models and group recommendation methods on generalization performance, herbs recommendation, symptoms suggestion, and prescribing patterns discovery.	Semantic Scholar
This paper reports on a model-assisted bundle adjustment (BA) framework in which visually-derived features are fused with an underlying three-dimensional (3D) mesh provided a priori.	Semantic Scholar
By using an approach inspired by the expectationmaximization (EM) class of algorithms, we introduce a hidden binary label for each visual feature that indicates if that feature is considered part of the nominal model, or if the feature corresponds to 3D structure that is absent from the model.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, in addition to improved estimates of the feature locations, we can identify visual features that correspond to foreign structure on the ship hull.	Semantic Scholar
We show that this framework is a special case of the Gaussian maxmixtures framework, which can be efficiently incorporated into state-of-the-art graph-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) solvers.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the precision of our bundle adjustment framework allows the identification of structural deviations between 3D structure inferred from bundle-adjusted camera imagery and the prior model.	Semantic Scholar
These structural deviations are clustered into shapes, which allow us to fuse camera-derived structure back into the 3D mesh.	Semantic Scholar
This augmented model can be used within a 3D photomosaicing pipeline, providing a visually intuitive 3D reconstruction of the ship hull.	Semantic Scholar

In addition to more consistent visual reconstructions, we can update the prior mesh with 3D information corresponding to underwater structure, such as biofouling or manually-placed cylindrical shapes with known dimensions.	Semantic Scholar
The task of object viewpoint estimation has been a challenge since the early days of computer vision.	Semantic Scholar
To estimate the viewpoint (or pose) of an object, people have mostly looked at object intrinsic features, such as shape or appearance.	Semantic Scholar
Surprisingly, informative features provided by other, extrinsic elements in the scene, have so far mostly been ignored.	Semantic Scholar
At the same time, contextual cues have been proven to be of great benefit for related tasks such as object detection or action recognition.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we explore how information from other objects in the scene can be exploited for viewpoint estimation.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we look at object configurations by following a relational neighbor-based approach for reasoning about object relations.	Semantic Scholar
We show that, starting from noisy object detections and viewpoint estimates, exploiting the estimated viewpoint and location of other objects in the scene can lead to improved object viewpoint predictions.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that object configurations can indeed be used as a complementary cue to appearance-based viewpoint estimation.	Semantic Scholar
Our analysis reveals that the proposed context-based method can improve object viewpoint estimation by reducing specific types of viewpoint estimation errors commonly made by methods that only consider local information.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, considering contextual information produces superior performance in scenes where a high number of object instances occur.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, our results suggest that, following a cautious relational neighbor formulation brings improvements over its aggressive counterpart for the task of object viewpoint estimation.	Semantic Scholar
Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is a chronic neurological impairment that affects motor coordination in 5%–8% of school-aged children.	Semantic Scholar
Diagnostic criteria for DCD are vague and focus on ruling out other conditions, leading to a lack of standardization in DCD diagnosis.	Semantic Scholar
This lack of standardization makes identification of the impairment, and therefore development of interventional tools, difficult.	Semantic Scholar
This study was conducted to investigate a set of potential quantitative models to identify DCD based on a robotic assessment, and to compare the performance of participants with DCD to normative models of typically developed motor function.	Semantic Scholar
An exploratory factor analysis achieved strong differentiation between control participants and participants with DCD.	Semantic Scholar
This demonstrates the feasibility of a robotic assessment as a diagnostic tool for DCD.	Semantic Scholar
This letter focuses on a multimodal language understanding method for carry-and-place tasks with domestic service robots.	Semantic Scholar
We address the case of ambiguous instructions, that is, when the target area is not specified.	Semantic Scholar
For instance “put away the milk and cereal” is a natural instruction where there is ambiguity regarding the target area, considering environments in daily life.	Semantic Scholar
Conventionally, this instruction can be disambiguated from a dialogue system, but at the cost of time and cumbersome interaction.	Semantic Scholar
Instead, we propose a multimodal approach, in which the instructions are disambiguated using the robot's state and environment context.	Semantic Scholar
We develop the Multi-Modal Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (MMC-GAN) to predict the likelihood of different target areas considering the robot's physical limitation and the target clutter.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach, MMC-GAN, significantly improves accuracy compared with baseline methods that use instructions only or simple deep neural networks.	Semantic Scholar

Different from the widely-studied full-order state estimator design, this paper focuses on dealing with the reduced-order state estimation problem for delayed recurrent neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
By employing an integral inequality, a delay-dependent design approach is proposed, and global asymptotical stability of the resulting error system is guaranteed.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown that the gain matrix of the reduced-order state estimator is determined by the solution of a linear matrix inequality.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed result.	Semantic Scholar
Continuum robots are increasingly used in minimally invasive surgeries.	Semantic Scholar
To date, the concentric tube mechanism and the cable-driven mechanism have been two prevalent mechanisms for constructing continuum robots.	Semantic Scholar
As these two mechanisms complement each other, it is worth exploring the possibility of combining them together.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we investigate the dexterity of three continuum robots combining both mechanisms.	Semantic Scholar
Indices based on the concept of orientability are introduced to analyze the distribution of the dexterity.	Semantic Scholar
A Monte Carlo method is used to calculate the dexterity distribution across the workspace.	Semantic Scholar
Particularly, directional dexterity indices are put forward to describe the dexterity along different axes.	Semantic Scholar
Results imply that evenly allocating degrees of freedom (DOFs) among the segments achieves the best workspace and dexterity.	Semantic Scholar
Otherwise, assigning more DOFs to the proximal segment tends to enlarge the workspace and adding more DOFs to the distal segment tends to improve the dexterity.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the dexterity along different axes can vary significantly and thus requires special attention when applying the robot to specific surgical procedures.	Semantic Scholar
Robots are designed to tackle specific problems or are designed as a multipurpose platform that achieves a concept.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we approach the hardware design problem from practice and evaluation through numerous competitions including the Darpa Robotics Challenge, the Amazon Picking Challenge, and other competitions that were held in Japan.	Semantic Scholar
The paper aims to answer the question what hardware design would we achieve if we continuously refine designs through competitions?	Semantic Scholar
We show that competitions lead to a more compact but capable platform design that is durable and has more end effector solutions.	Semantic Scholar
We also point out the limitations and benefits of using competitions for designing robot platforms.	Semantic Scholar
Our platform began from a human-inspired design for teleoperation and has evolved to mix both human-like and industrial robot structure.	Semantic Scholar

Traditionally, recommender systems modelled the physical and cyber contextual influence on people’s moving, querying, and browsing behaviors in isolation.	Semantic Scholar
Yet, searching, querying, and moving behaviors are intricately linked, especially indoors.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we introduce a tripartite location-query-browse graph (LQB) for nuanced contextual recommendations.	Semantic Scholar
The LQB graph consists of three kinds of nodes: locations, queries, and Web domains.	Semantic Scholar
Directed connections only between heterogeneous nodes represent the contextual influences, while connections of homogeneous nodes are inferred from the contextual influences of the other nodes.	Semantic Scholar
This tripartite LQB graph is more reliable than any monopartite or bipartite graph in contextual location, query, and Web content recommendations.	Semantic Scholar
We validate this LQB graph in an indoor retail scenario with extensive dataset of three logs collected from over 120,000 anonymized, opt-in users over a 1-year period in a large inner-city mall in Sydney, Australia.	Semantic Scholar
We characterize the contextual influences that correspond to the arcs in the LQB graph, and evaluate the usefulness of the LQB graph for location, query, and Web content recommendations.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results show that the LQB graph successfully captures the contextual influence and significantly outperforms the state of the art in these applications.	Semantic Scholar
The past decade has witnessed significant progress in object detection and tracking in videos.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a collaborative model between a pre-trained object detector and a number of singleobject online trackers within the particle filtering framework.	Semantic Scholar
For each frame, we construct an association between detections and trackers, and treat each detected image region as a key sample, for online update, if it is associated to a tracker.	Semantic Scholar
We present a motion model that incorporates the associated detections with object dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we propose an effective sample selection scheme to update the appearance model of each tracker.	Semantic Scholar
We use discriminative and generative appearance models for the likelihood function and data association, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that the proposed scheme generally outperforms state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar

Pose-invariant face alignment is a very challenging problem in computer vision, which is used as a prerequisite for many facial analysis tasks, e.g., face recognition, expression recognition, and 3D face reconstruction.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, there have been a few attempts to tackle this problem, but still more research is needed to achieve higher accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a face alignment method that aligns an image with arbitrary poses, by combining the powerful cascaded CNN regressors, 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), and mirrorability constraint.	Semantic Scholar
The core of our proposed method is a novel 3DMM fitting algorithm, where the camera projection matrix parameters and 3D shape parameters are estimated by a cascade of CNN-based regressors.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we impose the mirrorability constraint during the CNN learning by employing a novel loss function inside the siamese network.	Semantic Scholar
The dense 3D shape enables us to design pose-invariant appearance features for effective CNN learning.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments are conducted on the challenging large-pose face databases (AFLW and AFW), with comparison to the state of the art.	Semantic Scholar

Electrophysiological studies in animals may provide a great insight into developing brain-like models of spatial cognition for robots.	Semantic Scholar
These studies suggest that the spatial ability of animals requires proper functioning of the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex (EC).	Semantic Scholar
The involvement of the hippocampus in spatial cognition has been extensively studied, both in animal as well as in theoretical studies, such as in the brain-based models by Edelman and colleagues.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we extend these earlier models, with a particular focus on the spatial coding properties of the EC and how it functions as an interface between the hippocampus and the neocortex, as proposed by previous work.	Semantic Scholar
By realizing the cognitive memory and mapping functions of the hippocampus and the EC, respectively, we develop a neurobiologically-inspired system to enable a mobile robot to perform task-based navigation in a maze environment.	Semantic Scholar
Knowledge based approaches developed for AI planning can convert an intractable planning problem to a tractable one.	Semantic Scholar
Current techniques often use temporal logics to express Search Control Knowledge (SCK) in logic based planning.	Semantic Scholar
However, traditional temporal logics are limited in expressiveness since they are unable to express spatial constraints which are as important as temporal ones in many planning domains.	Semantic Scholar

Modeling self-organization of neural networks for unsupervised learning using Hebbian and anti-Hebbian plasticity has a long history in neuroscience.	Semantic Scholar
Yet derivations of single-layer networks with such local learning rules from principled optimization objectives became possible only recently, with the introduction of similarity matching objectives.	Semantic Scholar
What explains the success of similarity matching objectives in deriving neural networks with local learning rules?	Semantic Scholar
Here, using dimensionality reduction as an example, we introduce several variable substitutions that illuminate the success of similarity matching.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the full network objective may be optimized separately for each synapse using local learning rules in both the offline and online settings.	Semantic Scholar
We formalize the long-standing intuition of the rivalry between Hebbian and anti-Hebbian rules by formulating a min-max optimization problem.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce a novel dimensionality reduction objective using fractional matrix exponents.	Semantic Scholar
To illustrate the generality of our approach, we apply it to a novel formulation of dimensionality reduction combined with whitening.	Semantic Scholar
We confirm numerically that the networks with learning rules derived from principled objectives perform better than those with heuristic learning rules.	Semantic Scholar
To properly evaluate the ability of robots to operate autonomously in the real world, it is necessary to develop methods for quantifying their self-righting capabilities.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we improve upon a sampling-based framework for evaluating self-righting capabilities that was previously validated in two dimensions.	Semantic Scholar
To apply this framework to realistic robots in three dimensions, we require algorithms capable of scaling to high-dimensional configuration spaces.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we introduce a novel adaptive sampling approach that biases queries toward the transitional states of the system, thus, identifying the critical transitions of the system using substantially fewer samples.	Semantic Scholar
To demonstrate this improvement, we compare our approach to results that were generated via the previous framework and were validated on hardware platforms.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we apply our technique to a high-fidelity three-dimensional model of a US Navy bomb-defusing robot, which was too complex for the previous framework to analyze.	Semantic Scholar
This paper is concerned with event-triggered H∞ filtering for delayed neural networks via sampled data.	Semantic Scholar
A novel event-triggered scheme is proposed, which can lead to a significant reduction of the information communication burden in the network; the feature of this scheme is that whether or not the sampled data should be transmitted is determined by the current sampled data and the error between the current sampled data and the latest transmitted data.	Semantic Scholar
By constructing a proper Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, utilizing the reciprocally convex combination technique and Jensen's inequality sufficient conditions are derived to ensure that the resultant filtering error system is asymptotically stable.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the derived H∞ performance analysis results, the H∞ filter design is formulated in terms of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs).	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the proposed stability conditions are demonstrated with numerical example.	Semantic Scholar
We formally define the foundations of the Mizar system as an object logic in the Isabelle logical framework.	Semantic Scholar
For this, we propose adequate mechanisms to represent the various components of Mizar.	Semantic Scholar
We express Mizar types in a uniform way, provide a common type intersection operation, allow reasoning about type inhabitation, and develop a type inference mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
We provide Mizar-like definition mechanisms which require the same proof obligations and provide same derived properties.	Semantic Scholar
Structures and set comprehension operators can be defined as definitional extensions.	Semantic Scholar
Re-formalized proofs from various parts of the Mizar Library show the practical usability of the specified foundations.	Semantic Scholar
When using a camera to estimate the pose of a moving target, measurements may only be available intermittently, due to feature tracking losses from occlusions or the limited field of view of the camera.	Semantic Scholar
Results spanning back to the Kalman filter have demonstrated the utility of using a predictor to update state estimates when measurements are not available, but target velocity measurements or a motion model must be known to implement a predictor for image-based pose estimation.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a novel estimator and predictor are developed to simultaneously learn a motion model, and estimate the pose, of a moving target from a moving camera.	Semantic Scholar
A stability analysis is provided to prove convergence of the state estimates and function approximation without requiring the restrictive persistent excitation condition.	Semantic Scholar
Two experiments illustrate the performance of the developed estimator and predictor.	Semantic Scholar
One experiment involves a stationary camera observing a mobile robot with sporadic feature tracking losses, and a second experiment involves a quadcopter moving between two mobile robots on a road network.	Semantic Scholar
Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that output pixel-level brightness changes instead of standard intensity frames.	Semantic Scholar
They offer significant advantages over standard cameras, namely a very high dynamic range, no motion blur, and a latency in the order of microseconds.	Semantic Scholar
However, because the output is composed of a sequence of asynchronous events rather than actual intensity images, traditional vision algorithms cannot be applied, so that a paradigm shift is needed.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce the problem of event-based multi-view stereo (EMVS) for event cameras and propose a solution to it.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike traditional MVS methods, which address the problem of estimating dense 3D structure from a set of known viewpoints, EMVS estimates semi-dense 3D structure from an event camera with known trajectory.	Semantic Scholar
Our EMVS solution elegantly exploits two inherent properties of an event camera: (1) its ability to respond to scene edges—which naturally provide semi-dense geometric information without any pre-processing operation—and (2) the fact that it provides continuous measurements as the sensor moves.	Semantic Scholar
Despite its simplicity (it can be implemented in a few lines of code), our algorithm is able to produce accurate, semi-dense depth maps, without requiring any explicit data association or intensity estimation.	Semantic Scholar
We successfully validate our method on both synthetic and real data.	Semantic Scholar
Our method is computationally very efficient and runs in real-time on a CPU.	Semantic Scholar
Collaborative virtual environments (VEs) require interaction models for resolving conflicts and promoting multiuser collaboration.	Semantic Scholar
Common models, such as the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) model, which grants interaction opportunities to the most agile user, and the static priority model, which gives interaction opportunities to the user with the highest predefined priority, disregard the importance of perceiving equality in interaction (EII) among all users.	Semantic Scholar
One exception is the dynamic priority (DP) model, as proposed in our earlier work, which grants interaction opportunities to a user based on the recency of his/her gained opportunities.	Semantic Scholar
To date, few research efforts have investigated the effect of interaction models on multiuser satisfaction.	Semantic Scholar
This paper hence presents an assessment of the DP model's effect on multiuser satisfaction within a collaborative VE.	Semantic Scholar
We first verified that the DP model allowed multiple users to perceive EII.	Semantic Scholar
We then conducted an experiment to examine the effect of the DP and FCFS models on multiuser satisfaction under a quasi-practical scenario that mimicked a decision-making meeting of experts.	Semantic Scholar
The framework of the examination was based on several metrics, which we proposed for the components of the ISO/IEC 25010:2011 standard.	Semantic Scholar
This framework resolved issues with existing metrics that measure user satisfaction by analyzing individual experience, thus omitting EII desired by multiple users.	Semantic Scholar
The results of the experiment indicated that the DP model fulfilled the metrics of the framework significantly better than the FCFS model.	Semantic Scholar
This observation implies a potential application of the DP model in collaborative VEs where multiuser satisfaction is the key to productive collaboration.	Semantic Scholar
Natural systems, like the hydrological, climatological, atmospheric, or any other environmental processes, are extremely complex as well as dynamic in nature.	Semantic Scholar
It is therefore difficult to forecast, analyze, and quantify these processes by using simple empirical equations.	Semantic Scholar
Modeling and forecasting of reservoir water dynamics are not exceptions in this respect, as these involve various challenges due to the effect of meteorological factors, natural processes of stream flow, climatic change, and so on.	Semantic Scholar
The intent of our present work is to propose a novel forecasting model, FORWARD, that handles some of these issues in complex reservoir dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
FORWARD is based on a variant of spatial Bayesian network (SpaBN), having inherent capability of modeling impact of spatial variability of meteorological factors over the river catchment.	Semantic Scholar
The forecasting efficiency of FORWARD has been compared with four other linear and non-linear techniques based on six different statistical performance measures.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results show the superiority of FORWARD over the other techniques.	Semantic Scholar
Though FORWARD has been demonstrated with respect to a case study on forecasting reservoir live capacity, the model possesses a generic structure that can also be applied in other domains by introducing minimal augmentation.	Semantic Scholar
This letter explores the design and development of a class of robust diver detection algorithms for autonomous diver-following applications.	Semantic Scholar
By considering the operational challenges for underwater visual tracking in diverse real-world settings, we formulate a set of desired features of a generic diver-following algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
We attempt to accommodate these features and maximize general tracking performance by exploiting the state-of-the-art deep object detection models.	Semantic Scholar
We fine tune the building blocks of these models with a goal of balancing the tradeoff between robustness and efficiency in an on-board setting under real-time constraints.	Semantic Scholar
Subsequently, we design an architecturally simple convolutional neural network based diver detection model that is much faster than the state-of-the-art deep models yet provides comparable detection performances.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we validate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed model through a number of diver-following experiments in closed-water and open-water environments.	Semantic Scholar
Selective weed treatment is a critical step in autonomous crop management as related to crop health and yield.	Semantic Scholar
However, a key challenge is reliable and accurate weed detection to minimize damage to surrounding plants.	Semantic Scholar

We use the recently developed encoder–decoder cascaded convolutional neural network, SegNet, that infers dense semantic classes while allowing any number of input image channels and class balancing with our sugar beet and weed datasets.	Semantic Scholar
To obtain training datasets, we established an experimental field with varying herbicide levels resulting in field plots containing only either crop or weed, enabling us to use the normalized difference vegetation index as a distinguishable feature for automatic ground truth generation.

These cross-fertilizations have been made possible thanks to CP flexibility, one of the main features of constraint programming languages.	Semantic Scholar
Constraint programming global constraints are in fact, a very powerful modeling tool, but also enable the embedding of sophisticated algorithms inherited by other disciplines.	Semantic Scholar
Real-time, accurate, and robust pupil detection is an essential prerequisite to enable pervasive eye-tracking and its applications – e.g., gaze-based human computer interaction, health monitoring, foveated rendering, and advanced driver assistance.	Semantic Scholar
However, automated pupil detection has proved to be an intricate task in real-world scenarios due to a large mixture of challenges such as quickly changing illumination and occlusions.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we introduce the Pupil Reconstructor (PuRe), a method for pupil detection in pervasive scenarios based on a novel edge segment selection and conditional segment combination schemes; the method also includes a confidence measure for the detected pupil.	Semantic Scholar

Moreover, we advance the evaluation protocol of pupil detection algorithms by also considering eye images in which pupils are not present.	Semantic Scholar
In this aspect, PuRe improved precision and specificity w.r.t.	Semantic Scholar

A novel robotic gripper with soft surfaces and underactuated joints was proposed.	Semantic Scholar
The soft surface was fabricated from a deformable rubber bag filled with incompressible fluid and a microgripper inside the fluid.	Semantic Scholar
A ratchet was installed at the underactuated joint so that the joint's rotation caused by contact with an environment, such as a supporting surface, can be preserved, and the actions of scooping and enveloping an object are realized.	Semantic Scholar
With one actuator, the gripper realized three modes, i.e., parallel gripper, pinching, and enveloping.	Semantic Scholar
The range of graspable objects was wide and included soft, rigid, deformable, fragile, small (boundary length less than 30 mm), large (more than 80 mm long), thin (less than 0.5 mm), and heavy (more than 3 kg) objects.	Semantic Scholar
This paper mainly contributes in the achievement of a new control architecture designed for an electric wheelchair moves in a three-dimension (3D) indoor environment.	Semantic Scholar
This control system aims to provide autonomy to all disabled people.	Semantic Scholar
Even if we confine ourselves to a wheelchair, this work contributes to the field of mobile robotics with the proposed reactive control architecture based on a set of reactive behaviours, which operate in parallel and result rapid solution in a cluttered environment.	Semantic Scholar
Various automatic operations were planned during the design of this architecture, such as wheelchair goal tracking in free environment, perception, avoiding unplanned 3D obstacles and wheelchair hybrid localization.	Semantic Scholar
The conducted experiments demonstrates the performance of the proposed reactive control architecture for a wheelchair.	Semantic Scholar
Augmented reality (AR) systems have been proposed for medical needle procedures as alternatives to restore the physician's natural perspective and head motion parallax that are lost when using standard imaging methods.	Semantic Scholar
AR systems have assumed a rigid needle, but in practice, a needle can experience large deflections that can lead to significant errors.	Semantic Scholar
We combine an instrumented needle that measures bending deflections with optical tracking of the needle base for precision and an AR system to provide users with precise three-dimensional rendering of needle motion and deflection inside a body.	Semantic Scholar
In controlled tests, users guided a needle through 7 cm of tissue phantom to reach a 2-mm diameter target.	Semantic Scholar
We found that displaying needle shape allows users significantly reduce placement errors when compared to the rigid needle assumption.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, a new display technique called tip tangent extrapolation, based on the sensed needle endpoint and direction, allowed users to further reduce errors resulting in 26% less error when compared to a rigid needle assumption.	Semantic Scholar

We formalise second-order ZF set theory in the dependent type theory of Coq.	Semantic Scholar
Assuming excluded middle, we prove Zermelo’s embedding theorem for models, categoricity in all cardinalities, and the categoricity of extended axiomatisations fixing the number of Grothendieck universes.	Semantic Scholar
These results are based on an inductive definition of the cumulative hierarchy eliminating the need for ordinals and set-theoretic transfinite recursion.	Semantic Scholar
Following Aczel’s sets-as-trees interpretation, we give a concise construction of an intensional model of second-order ZF with a weakened replacement axiom.	Semantic Scholar
Whereas this construction depends on no additional logical axioms, we obtain intensional and extensional models with full replacement assuming a description operator for trees and a weak form of proof irrelevance.	Semantic Scholar
In fact, these assumptions yield large models with n Grothendieck universes for every number n.	Semantic Scholar
Manual dexterity is one of the most important surgical skills, and yet there are limited instruments to evaluate this ability objectively.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a system designed to track surgeons’ hand movements during simulated open surgery tasks and to evaluate their manual expertise.	Semantic Scholar
Eighteen participants, grouped according to their surgical experience, performed repetitions of two basic surgical tasks, namely single interrupted suture and simple running suture.	Semantic Scholar
Subjects’ hand movements were measured with a sensory glove equipped with flex and inertial sensors, tracking flexion/extension of hand joints, and wrist movement.	Semantic Scholar
The participants’ level of experience was evaluated discriminating manual performances using linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines, and artificial neural network classifiers.	Semantic Scholar
Artificial neural networks showed the best performance, with a median error rate of 0.61% on the classification of single interrupted sutures and of 0.57% on simple running sutures.	Semantic Scholar
Strategies to reduce sensory glove complexity and increase its comfort did not affect system performances substantially.	Semantic Scholar
Descriptive clustering consists of automatically organizing data instances into clusters and generating a descriptive summary for each cluster.	Semantic Scholar
The description should inform a user about the contents of each cluster without further examination of the specific instances, enabling a user to rapidly scan for relevant clusters.	Semantic Scholar
Selection of descriptions often relies on heuristic criteria.	Semantic Scholar
We model descriptive clustering as an auto-encoder network that predicts features from cluster assignments and predicts cluster assignments from a subset of features.	Semantic Scholar
The subset of features used for predicting a cluster serves as its description.	Semantic Scholar
For text documents, the occurrence or count of words, phrases, or other attributes provides a sparse feature representation with interpretable feature labels.	Semantic Scholar
In the proposed network, cluster predictions are made using logistic regression models, and feature predictions rely on logistic or multinomial regression models.	Semantic Scholar
Optimizing these models leads to a completely self-tuned descriptive clustering approach that automatically selects the number of clusters and the number of features for each cluster.	Semantic Scholar
We applied the methodology to a variety of short text documents and showed that the selected clustering, as evidenced by the selected feature subsets, are associated with a meaningful topical organization.	Semantic Scholar
Many combinatorial problems in various fields can be translated to Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) problems.	Semantic Scholar
Although the general problem is NP $\mathcal {N}\mathcal {P}$-hard, more and more practical problems may be solved due to the significant effort which has been devoted to the development of efficient solvers.	Semantic Scholar
The art of constraints encoding is as important as the art of devising algorithms for MaxSAT.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present several encoding methods of pseudo-Boolean constraints into Boolean satisfiability problems in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) formula, which are based on the idea of modular arithmetic and only generate auxiliary variables for each unique combination of weights.	Semantic Scholar
These techniques are efficient in encoding and solving MaxSAT problems.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, our solvers won the partial MaxSAT industrial category from 2010 through 2012 and ranked second in the 2017 main weighted track of the MaxSAT evaluation.	Semantic Scholar
We prove the correctness and the pseudo-polynomial space complexity of our encodings and also give a heuristics of the base selection for modular arithmetic.	Semantic Scholar
Our experimental results show that our encoding compactly encodes the constraints, and the obtained clauses are efficiently handled by a state-of-the-art SAT solver.	Semantic Scholar
A novel approach to the autonomous generation of trajectories for multiple aerial vehicles is presented, whereby an artificial kinematic field provides autonomous control in a distributed and highly scalable manner.	Semantic Scholar
The kinematic field is generated relative to a central target and is modified when a vehicle is in close proximity of another to avoid collisions.	Semantic Scholar
This control scheme is then applied to the mock visual inspection of a nuclear intermediate level waste storage drum.	Semantic Scholar
The inspection is completed using two commercially available quadcopters, in a laboratory environment, with the acquired visual inspection data processed and photogrammetrically meshed to generate a threedimensional surface-meshed model of the drum.	Semantic Scholar
This paper contributes to the field of multi-agent coverage path planning for structural inspection and provides experimental validation of the control and inspection results.	Semantic Scholar
Recordings of neural network activity in vitro are increasingly being used to assess the development of neural network activity and the effects of drugs, chemicals and disease states on neural network function.	Semantic Scholar
The high-content nature of the data derived from such recordings can be used to infer effects of compounds or disease states on a variety of important neural functions, including network synchrony.	Semantic Scholar
Historically, synchrony of networks in vitro has been assessed either by determination of correlation coefficients (e.g.	Semantic Scholar
Pearson's correlation), by statistics estimated from cross-correlation histograms between pairs of active electrodes, and/or by pairwise mutual information and related measures.	Semantic Scholar
The present study examines the application of Normalized Multiinformation (NMI) as a scalar measure of shared information content in a multivariate network that is robust with respect to changes in network size.	Semantic Scholar
Theoretical simulations are designed to investigate NMI as a measure of complexity and synchrony in a developing network relative to several alternative approaches.	Semantic Scholar
The NMI approach is applied to these simulations and also to data collected during exposure of in vitro neural networks to neuroactive compounds during the first 12 days in vitro, and compared to other common measures, including correlation coefficients and mean firing rates of neurons.	Semantic Scholar
NMI is shown to be more sensitive to developmental effects than first order synchronous and nonsynchronous measures of network complexity.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, NMI is a scalar measure of global (rather than pairwise) mutual information in a multivariate network, and hence relies on less assumptions for cross-network comparisons than historical approaches.	Semantic Scholar
Visual servoing in telerobotics provides information to the operator about the remote location and assists in the task execution to reduce stress on the user.	Semantic Scholar
Occlusions in this scenario can, on the one hand, lead to the visual servoing failure, and, on the other hand, degrade the user experience and navigation performance due to the obstructed vision of elements of interest.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we consider a teleoperation system composed of two robot arms where one is remotely operated, while the other is autonomous and equipped with an eye-in-hand camera sensor.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a reactive unified convex optimization based controller that allows the execution of occlusion-free tasks by autonomously adjusting the camera robot, so as to keep the teleoperated one in the field of view.	Semantic Scholar
The occlusion avoidance is formulated inside the optimization as a constraint in the image space, it is formally derived from a collision avoidance analogy and made robust against noisy measurements and dynamic environment.	Semantic Scholar

Intensive summer schools often provide strong students with career-changing impact, teaching them the art of the trade, letting them understand the logical underbelly of a field, and connecting them with an elite circle of peers and field leaders.	Semantic Scholar
Indeed, many professors attribute considerable aspects of their growth as a scientist to such schools.	Semantic Scholar
Such summer schools are an essential service to the community.	Semantic Scholar
A well-run summer school combines many of the aspects that jointly define students overall success.	Semantic Scholar
Eight years of organizing the annual two-week Computational Sensory-Motor Neuroscience (CoSMo, http://www.compneurosci.com/CoSMo) summer school has allowed us to experiment with different approaches and evaluate teaching outcomes, and we have seen rather clear patterns.	Semantic Scholar
Many new schools are started each year, only some move on to ongoing success, and the vast majority take a while until they reach very good ratings (our ratings are still increasing but approaching 10/10).	Semantic Scholar
Focusing on the student experience, we present a set of 10 simple rules to help you organize better summer schools that are more useful to students.	Semantic Scholar
We present a new type of artificial neural network that generalizes on anatomical and dynamical aspects of the mammal brain.	Semantic Scholar
Its main novelty lies in its topological structure which is built as an array of interacting elementary motifs shaped like loops.	Semantic Scholar
These loops come in various types and can implement functions such as gating, inhibitory or executive control, or encoding of task elements to name a few.	Semantic Scholar
Each loop features two sets of neurons and a control region, linked together by non-recurrent projections.	Semantic Scholar
The two neural sets do the bulk of the loop's computations while the control unit specifies the timing and the conditions under which the computations implemented by the loop are to be performed.	Semantic Scholar
By functionally linking many such loops together, a neural network is obtained that may perform complex cognitive computations.	Semantic Scholar
To demonstrate the potential offered by such a system, we present two neural network simulations.	Semantic Scholar
The first illustrates the structure and dynamics of a single loop implementing a simple gating mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
The second simulation shows how connecting four loops in series can produce neural activity patterns that are sufficient to pass a simplified delayed-response task.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that this network reproduces electrophysiological measurements gathered in various regions of the brain of monkeys performing similar tasks.	Semantic Scholar
We also demonstrate connections between this type of neural network and recurrent or long short-term memory network models, and suggest ways to generalize them for future artificial intelligence research.	Semantic Scholar

Kinship verification is receiving increasing attention among computer vision researchers due to interesting applications ranging from family album management to searching missing family members.	Semantic Scholar
Existing approaches have focused on using face images to decode kinship information.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast, this paper explores the effectiveness of periocular region in verifying kinship from images captured in the wild.	Semantic Scholar
Further, we also propose a block-based neighborhood repulsed metric learning (BNRML) framework, an extension of NRML, to yield more discriminative power.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method learns multiple local distance metrics from different blocks of the images represented by local ternary patterns.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, to contemplate diversity in discrimination power of different blocks, weighted score-level fusion scheme is used to obtain a similarity score of image pair.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on KinFaceW-I and KinFaceW-II datasets demonstrated the potential of periocular features for kinship verification.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the fusion of periocular and face traits under BNRML framework provided highly competitive results as compared to state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
Obtaining an accurate mechanical model of a soft deformable robot compatible with the computation time imposed by robotic applications is often considered an unattainable goal.	Semantic Scholar
This paper should invert this idea.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed methodology offers the possibility to dramatically reduce the size and the online computation time of a finite element model (FEM) of a soft robot.	Semantic Scholar
After a set of expensive offline simulations based on the whole model, we apply snapshot-proper orthogonal decomposition to sharply reduce the number of state variables of the soft-robot model.	Semantic Scholar
To keep the computational efficiency, hyperreduction is used to perform the integration on a reduced domain.	Semantic Scholar
The method allows to tune the error during the two main steps of complexity reduction.	Semantic Scholar
The method handles external loads (contact, friction, gravity, etc.)	Semantic Scholar
with precision as long as they are tested during the offline simulations.	Semantic Scholar
The method is validated on two very different examples of FEMs of soft robots and on one real soft robot.	Semantic Scholar
It enables acceleration factors of more than 100, while saving accuracy, in particular compared to coarsely meshed FEMs and provides a generic way to control soft robots.	Semantic Scholar
To efficiently learn from feedback, cortical networks need to update synaptic weights on multiple levels of cortical hierarchy.	Semantic Scholar
An effective and well-known algorithm for computing such changes in synaptic weights is the error backpropagation algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
However, in this algorithm, the change in synaptic weights is a complex function of weights and activities of neurons not directly connected with the synapse being modified, whereas the changes in biological synapses are determined only by the activity of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons.	Semantic Scholar
Several models have been proposed that approximate the backpropagation algorithm with local synaptic plasticity, but these models require complex external control over the network or relatively complex plasticity rules.	Semantic Scholar
Here we show that a network developed in the predictive coding framework can efficiently perform supervised learning fully autonomously, employing only simple local Hebbian plasticity.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, for certain parameters, the weight change in the predictive coding model converges to that of the backpropagation algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
This suggests that it is possible for cortical networks with simple Hebbian synaptic plasticity to implement efficient learning algorithms in which synapses in areas on multiple levels of hierarchy are modified to minimize the error on the output.	Semantic Scholar
A well-known and powerful constraint model reformulation is to compute the solutions to a model part, say a custom constraint predicate, and tabulate them within an extensional constraint that replaces that model part.	Semantic Scholar
Despite the possibility of achieving higher solving performance, this tabling reformulation is often not tried, because it is tedious to perform; further, if successful, it obfuscates the original model.	Semantic Scholar
In order to encourage modellers to try tabling, we extend the MiniZinc toolchain to perform the automatic tabling of suitably annotated predicate definitions, without requiring any changes to solvers, thereby eliminating both the tedium and the obfuscation.	Semantic Scholar
Our experiments show that automated tabling yields the same tables as manual tabling, and that tabling is beneficial for solvers of several solving technologies.	Semantic Scholar
We consider the problem of distributing a large group of heterogeneous robots among a set of tasks that require specialized capabilities in order to be completed.	Semantic Scholar
We model the system of heterogeneous robots as a community of species, in which each species (robot type) is defined by the traits (capabilities) that it owns.	Semantic Scholar
In order to solve the distribution problem, we develop centralized as well as decentralized methods to efficiently control the heterogeneous swarm of robots.	Semantic Scholar
Our methods assume knowledge of the underlying task topology and are based on a continuous model of the system that defines transition rates to and from tasks, for each robot species.	Semantic Scholar
Our optimization of the transition rates is fully scalable with respect to the number of robots, number of species, and number of traits.	Semantic Scholar
Building on this result, we propose a real-time optimization method that enables an online adaptation of transition rates as a function of the state of the current robot distribution.	Semantic Scholar
We also show how the robot distribution can be approximated based on local information only, consequently enabling the development of a decentralized controller.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our methods by means of microscopic simulations and show how the performance of the latter is well predicted by the macroscopic equations.	Semantic Scholar
Importantly, our framework also includes a diversity metric that enables an evaluation of the impact of swarm heterogeneity on performance.	Semantic Scholar
The metric defines the notion of minspecies, i.e., the minimum set of species that are required to achieve a given goal.	Semantic Scholar
We show that two distinct goal functions lead to two specializations of minspecies, which we term as eigenspecies and coverspecies.	Semantic Scholar
Quantitative results show the relation between diversity and performance.	Semantic Scholar
In recent years soft wearable exoskeletons, commonly referred to as exosuits, have been widely exploited in human assistance.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, a shared approach for a systematic and exhaustive control architecture is extremely important.	Semantic Scholar
Most of the exosuits developed so far employ a bowden cable transmission to conveniently place the actuator away from the end-effector.	Semantic Scholar
While having many advantages this actuation strategy presents some intrinsic limitations caused by the presence of nonlinearities, such as friction and backlash of the cables, which make it difficult to predict and control the dynamics between the device and the user.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a novel hierarchical control paradigm for a cable-driven upper limb exosuits that aims at evaluating and consequently deliver the appropriate assistive torque to the user's elbow joint.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed control method comprises three main layers: an active impedance control which estimates the user's arm motion intention and guarantees an intuitive response of the suit to the wearer's motion; a mid-level controller which compensates for the backlash in the transmission and converts the reference arm motion to the desired position of the actuator; a low-level controller which is responsible for driving the actuation stage by compensating for the nonlinear dynamics occurring in the bowden cable to provide the desired assistive torque at the joint.	Semantic Scholar
Tests on healthy subjects show that wearing the exosuit reduces by  $48.3\%$ the muscular effort required to lift 1 kg and that the controller is able to modulate its level of assistance to the wearer's motor ability.	Semantic Scholar
Traditional relational topic models provide a successful way to discover the hidden topics from a document network.	Semantic Scholar
Many theoretical and practical tasks, such as dimensional reduction, document clustering, and link prediction, could benefit from this revealed knowledge.	Semantic Scholar
However, existing relational topic models are based on an assumption that the number of hidden topics is known a priori, which is impractical in many real-world applications.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, in order to relax this assumption, we propose a nonparametric relational topic model using stochastic processes instead of fixed-dimensional probability distributions in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, each document is assigned a Gamma process, which represents the topic interest of this document.	Semantic Scholar
Although this method provides an elegant solution, it brings additional challenges when mathematically modeling the inherent network structure of typical document network, i.e., two spatially closer documents tend to have more similar topics.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we require that the topics are shared by all the documents.	Semantic Scholar
In order to resolve these challenges, we use a subsampling strategy to assign each document a different Gamma process from the global Gamma process, and the subsampling probabilities of documents are assigned with a Markov Random Field constraint that inherits the document network structure.	Semantic Scholar
Through the designed posterior inference algorithm, we can discover the hidden topics and its number simultaneously.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world network datasets demonstrate the capabilities of learning the hidden topics and, more importantly, the number of topics.	Semantic Scholar
Today AUVs operation still remains restricted to very particular tasks with low real autonomy due to battery restrictions.	Semantic Scholar
Efficient path planning and mission scheduling are principle requirement toward advance autonomy and facilitate the vehicle to handle long-range operations.	Semantic Scholar
A single vehicle cannot carry out all tasks in a large scale terrain; hence, it needs a certain degree of autonomy in performing robust decision making and awareness of the mission/environment to trade-off between tasks to be completed, managing the available time, and ensuring safe deployment at all stages of the mission.	Semantic Scholar
In this respect, this research introduces a modular control architecture including higher/lower level planners, in which the higher level module is responsible for increasing mission productivity by assigning prioritized tasks while guiding the vehicle toward its final destination in a terrain covered by several waypoints; and the lower level is responsible for vehicle’s safe deployment in a smaller scale encountering time-varying ocean current and different uncertain static/moving obstacles similar to actual ocean environment.	Semantic Scholar
Synchronization between higher and lower level modules is efficiently configured to manage the mission time and to guarantee on-time termination of the mission.	Semantic Scholar
The performance and accuracy of two higher and lower level modules are tested and validated using ant colony and firefly optimization algorithm, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
After all, the overall performance of the architecture is investigated in 10 different mission scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
The analysis of the captured results from different simulated missions confirm the efficiency and inherent robustness of the introduced architecture in efficient time management, safe deployment, and providing beneficial operation by proper prioritizing the tasks in accordance with mission time.

This paper presents an extension of Gaussian process implicit surfaces (GPIS) by the introduction of geometric object priors.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method enhances the probabilistic reconstruction of objects from three-dimensional (3-D) pointcloud data, providing a rigorous way of incorporating prior knowledge about objects expected in a scene.	Semantic Scholar
The key ideas, including the systematic use of surface normal information, are illustrated with one-dimensional and two-dimensional examples, and then applied to simulated and real pointcloud data for 3-D objects.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of our method is demonstrated in two different application scenarios, using complete and partial surface observations.	Semantic Scholar
Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results reveals the superiority of the proposed approach over existing GPIS configurations that do not exploit prior knowledge.	Semantic Scholar
Saliency detection, finding the most important parts of an image, has become increasingly popular in computer vision.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical Cellular Automata (HCA)—a temporally evolving model to intelligently detect salient objects.	Semantic Scholar
HCA consists of two main components: Single-layer Cellular Automata (SCA) and Cuboid Cellular Automata (CCA).	Semantic Scholar
As an unsupervised propagation mechanism, Single-layer Cellular Automata can exploit the intrinsic relevance of similar regions through interactions with neighbors.	Semantic Scholar
Low-level image features as well as high-level semantic information extracted from deep neural networks are incorporated into the SCA to measure the correlation between different image patches.	Semantic Scholar
With these hierarchical deep features, an impact factor matrix and a coherence matrix are constructed to balance the influences on each cell’s next state.	Semantic Scholar
The saliency values of all cells are iteratively updated according to a well-defined update rule.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we propose CCA to integrate multiple saliency maps generated by SCA at different scales in a Bayesian framework.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, single-layer propagation and multi-scale integration are jointly modeled in our unified HCA.	Semantic Scholar
Surprisingly, we find that the SCA can improve all existing methods that we applied it to, resulting in a similar precision level regardless of the original results.	Semantic Scholar
The CCA can act as an efficient pixel-wise aggregation algorithm that can integrate state-of-the-art methods, resulting in even better results.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art conventional methods and is competitive with deep learning based approaches.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents the effect of meaningful learning contexts and hands-on activities, facilitated using two robots that work with people (co-robots), in broadening and sustaining pre-college student engagement in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).	Semantic Scholar
The two co-robots are: 1) a Glider for Underwater Problem-solving and Promotion of Interest in Engineering or GUPPIE and 2) a Neurally controlled manipulator called Neu-pulator.	Semantic Scholar
The co-robots are easy and inexpensive to manufacture, with readily available lightweight and durable components.	Semantic Scholar
They are also modular to accommodate a variety of learning activities that help young students to learn crosscutting concepts and engineering practice.	Semantic Scholar
The early assessment results show that students’ interests in activities related to robotics depend on their perception of the difficulty and their confidence level.	Semantic Scholar
The key is to start early when the students are young.	Semantic Scholar
The challenge is to break the barriers and define tasks as fun activities with a learn and play approach that can be rewarding.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, using a meaningful context – as in co-robots that help humans– in a hands-on project-based program that integrates different aspect of design, science, and technology is found effective in increasing students’ enthusiasm and participation.	Semantic Scholar
The co-robots and the hands-on activities can be easily adopted in classrooms by teachers with no engineering background who seek innovative ways to connect interdisciplinary core ideas and standards to the concepts they need to teach.	Semantic Scholar
An important function in modern routers and switches is to perform a lookup for a key.	Semantic Scholar
Hash-based methods, and in particular cuckoo hash tables, are popular for such lookup operations, but for large structures stored in off-chip memory, such methods have the downside that they may require more than one off-chip memory access to perform the key lookup.	Semantic Scholar
Although the number of off-chip memory accesses can be reduced using on-chip approximate membership structures such as Bloom filters, some lookups may still require more than one off-chip memory access.	Semantic Scholar
This can be problematic for some hardware implementations, as having only a single off-chip memory access enables a predictable processing of lookups and avoids the need to queue pending requests.	Semantic Scholar
We provide a data structure for hash-based lookups based on cuckoo hashing that uses only one off-chip memory access per lookup, by utilizing an on-chip pre-filter to determine which of multiple locations holds a key.	Semantic Scholar
We make particular use of the flexibility to move elements within a cuckoo hash table to ensure the pre-filter always gives the correct response.	Semantic Scholar
While this requires a slightly more complex insertion procedure and some additional memory accesses during insertions, it is suitable for most packet processing applications where key lookups are much more frequent than insertions.	Semantic Scholar
An important feature of our approach is its simplicity.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach is based on simple logic that can be easily implemented in hardware, and hardware implementations would benefit most from the single off-chip memory access per lookup.	Semantic Scholar

In this study, we present an approach for the decentralized event-triggered synchronization of Markovian jumping neutral-type neural networks with mixed delays.	Semantic Scholar
We present a method for designing decentralized event-triggered synchronization, which only utilizes locally available information, in order to determine the time instants for transmission from sensors to a central controller.	Semantic Scholar
By applying a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, as well as using the reciprocal convex combination method and some inequality techniques such as Jensen's inequality, we obtain several sufficient conditions in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) under which the delayed neural networks are stochastically stable in terms of the error systems.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we conclude that the drive systems synchronize stochastically with the response systems.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the proposed stability criteria can be verified easily using the numerically efficient Matlab LMI toolbox.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness and feasibility of the results obtained are verified by numerical examples.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we investigate a more general sparse signal recovery minimization model and a smoothing neural network optimal method for compress sensing problem, where the objective function is a Lp-q minimization model which includes nonsmooth, nonconvex, and non-Lipschitz quasi-norm Lp norms 1≥p>0 and nonsmooth Lq norms 2≥p>1, and its feasible set is a closed convex subset of Rn.	Semantic Scholar
Firstly, under the restricted isometry property (RIP) condition, the uniqueness of solution for the minimization model with a given sparsity s is obtained through the theoretical analysis.	Semantic Scholar
With a mild condition, we get that the larger of the q, the more effective of the sparse recovery model under sensing matrix satisfies RIP conditions at fixed p. Secondly, using a smoothing approximate method, we propose the smoothing inertial projection neural network (SIPNN) algorithm for solving the proposed general model.	Semantic Scholar
Under certain conditions, the proposed algorithm can converge to a stationary point.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, convergence behavior and successful recover performance experiments and a comparison experiment confirm the effectiveness of the proposed SIPNN algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
In rehabilitation for neurological injuries, gravity compensation or deweighting of the upper limb is often performed, as it allows patients with limited muscle activities to realize movements.	Semantic Scholar
Deweighting cancels the gravitational effect of the human arm allowing the available muscle forces to produce acceleration, and thus movement of the arm.	Semantic Scholar
In robotic devices designed for rehabilitation, deweighting is performed by applying forces to the arm, either joint-by-joint (e.g., with exoskeletons) or at a single point (e.g., with end-effector-based manipulanda).	Semantic Scholar
This paper formulates the gravity compensation strategy for spatial (three-dimensional) manipulanda, considers the effect of the force applied by the robotic device on the generalized dynamics of the upper limb and critically evaluates the advantages and limitations of this approach.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, the proposed strategy is validated on the EMU robot, designed with the emphasis on its dynamically transparent mechanical transmission to allow an impedance control approach.	Semantic Scholar
The configuration of the EMU robot used in this letter only has 3 degrees of actuation, making it underactuated with respect to the task of regulating a human arm up to the wrist modeled with 4 degrees of freedom.	Semantic Scholar
The underactuation resulted in an uncompensated gravity induced moment about the swivel angle axis, which is a line connecting the shoulder and wrist points of the human arm.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed gravity compensation technique in cancelling the effect of gravity on the user's arm.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a novel and continuously differentiable convex loss function based on natural logarithm of hyperbolic cosine function, namely lncosh loss, is introduced to obtain Support Vector Regression (SVR) models which are optimal in the maximum likelihood sense for the hyper-secant error distributions.	Semantic Scholar
Most of the current regression models assume that the distribution of error is Gaussian, which corresponds to the squared loss function and has helpful analytical properties such as easy computation and analysis.	Semantic Scholar
However, in many real world applications, most observations are subject to unknown noise distributions, so the Gaussian distribution may not be a useful choice.	Semantic Scholar
The developed SVR model with the parameterized lncosh loss provides a possibility of learning a loss function leading to a regression model which is maximum likelihood optimal for a specific input-output data.	Semantic Scholar
The SVR models obtained with different parameter choices of lncosh loss with ε-insensitiveness feature, possess most of the desirable characteristics of well-known loss functions such as Vapnik's loss, the Squared loss, and Huber's loss function as special cases.	Semantic Scholar
In other words, it is observed in the extensive simulations that the mentioned lncosh loss function is entirely controlled by a single adjustable λ parameter and as a result, it allows switching between different losses depending on the choice of λ.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness and feasibility of lncosh loss function are validated through a number of synthetic and real world benchmark data sets for various types of additive noise distributions.	Semantic Scholar
Single hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) with fixed weights possess the universal approximation property provided that approximated functions are univariate.	Semantic Scholar
But this phenomenon does not lay any restrictions on the number of neurons in the hidden layer.	Semantic Scholar
The more this number, the more the probability of the considered network to give precise results.	Semantic Scholar
In this note, we constructively prove that SLFNs with the fixed weight 1 and two neurons in the hidden layer can approximate any continuous function on a compact subset of the real line.	Semantic Scholar
The proof is implemented by a step by step construction of a universal sigmoidal activation function.	Semantic Scholar
This function has nice properties such as computability, smoothness and weak monotonicity.	Semantic Scholar
The applicability of the obtained result is demonstrated in various numerical examples.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we show that SLFNs with fixed weights cannot approximate all continuous multivariate functions.	Semantic Scholar
Miniaturized grippers that possess an untethered structure are suitable for a wide range of tasks, ranging from micromanipulation and microassembly to minimally invasive surgical interventions.	Semantic Scholar
In order to robustly perform such tasks, it is critical to properly estimate their overall configuration.	Semantic Scholar
Previous studies on tracking and control of miniaturized agents estimated mainly their 2D pixel position, mostly using cameras and optical images as a feedback modality.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a novel solution to the problem of estimating and tracking the 3D position, orientation and configuration of the tips of submillimeter grippers from marker-less visual observations.	Semantic Scholar
We consider this as an optimization problem, which is solved using a variant of the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach has been implemented in a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) which allows a user to track the submillimeter agents online.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach has been evaluated on several image sequences obtained from a camera and on B-mode ultrasound images obtained from an ultrasound probe.	Semantic Scholar
The sequences show the grippers moving, rotating, opening/closing and grasping biological material.	Semantic Scholar
Qualitative results obtained using both hydrogel (soft) and metallic (hard) grippers with different shapes and sizes ranging from 750 microns to 4 mm (tip to tip), demonstrate the capability of the proposed method to track the agent in all the video sequences.	Semantic Scholar
Quantitative results obtained by processing synthetic data reveal a tracking position error of 25 ± 7 μm and orientation error of 1.7 ± 1.3 degrees.	Semantic Scholar
We believe that the proposed technique can be applied to different stimuli responsive miniaturized agents, allowing the user to estimate the full configuration of complex agents from visual marker-less observations.	Semantic Scholar
Quality control of additive manufacturing applications is required to improve the shape fidelity of the products, which relies on increasing the predictive performance of statistical deviation models for any new shape.	Semantic Scholar
Building a single comprehensive model for a wide range of shapes is a very challenging problem, since the error generating mechanism of additive manufacturing applications is usually of high complexity, the amount of training data is usually limited, and the connection among different shapes is unknown.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, a novel shape deviation modeling scheme is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
In this scheme, the dimensional error of the product is modeled in a parameter-based transfer learning approach.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the shape deviation is decomposed into two components: the shape-independent error and the shape-specific error.	Semantic Scholar
The shape-independent error is described by a statistical model that incorporates the engineering knowledge.	Semantic Scholar
Guidelines to investigate modeling of the shape-specific error are also given.	Semantic Scholar

Coil springs are a common element in compliant actuators.	Semantic Scholar
For closed-loop control, the force of the coil spring has to be measured.	Semantic Scholar
Typically, deflection sensors indirectly measure this force.	Semantic Scholar
Implicitly, this assumes that the coil spring is a pure stiffness, without any mass.	Semantic Scholar
In reality, internal oscillations can occur due to impacts or other excitations of the spring's resonance frequencies.	Semantic Scholar
This letter investigates the reliability of different force-sensing methods for coil springs that are oscillating internally.	Semantic Scholar
In addition to standard sensing via strain gauges or deflection sensors, also a new type of sensing is included, namely force estimation via the spring's own electrical inductance.	Semantic Scholar
First, a lumped-mass model is used in simulations of three realistic conditions a coil spring might be subjected to in robotic applications.	Semantic Scholar
Second, a hardware experiment is conducted for one condition.	Semantic Scholar
Key effects predicted by the model are also found in the experiment, confirming the model's validity.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that for all sensors, the increase in measuring uncertainty due to internal oscillations is of the same order of magnitude as typical sensors’ measuring uncertainty.	Semantic Scholar
Social robots are becoming a companion in everyday life.	Semantic Scholar
To be well accepted by humans, they should efficiently understand meanings of their partners’ motions and body language and respond accordingly.	Semantic Scholar
Learning concepts by imitation brings them this ability in a user-friendly way.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a fast and robust model for incremental learning of concepts by imitation (ILoCI).	Semantic Scholar
In ILoCI, observed multimodal spatiotemporal demonstrations are incrementally abstracted and generalized based on their perceptual and functional similarities during the imitation.	Semantic Scholar
Perceptually similar demonstrations are abstracted by a dynamic model of the mirror neuron system.	Semantic Scholar
The functional similarities of demonstrations are also learned through a limited number of interactions with the teacher.	Semantic Scholar
Incremental relearning of acquired concepts together through memory rehearsal enables the learner to gradually extract and utilize the common structural relations among demonstrations to expedite the learning process especially at the initial stages.	Semantic Scholar
Performance of ILoCI is assessed using a standard benchmark dataset and a human–robot interaction task in which a humanoid robot learns to abstract teacher's hand motions during imitation.	Semantic Scholar
Its performance is also evaluated on occluded observations that are probable in real environments.	Semantic Scholar
The results show efficiency of ILoCI in concept acquisition, recognition, prediction, and generation in addition to its robustness to occlusions and high variability in observations.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present two computational approaches for synthesizing decentralized density-feedback laws that asymptotically stabilize a strictly positive target equilibrium distribution of a swarm of agents among a set of states.	Semantic Scholar
The agents’ states evolve according to a continuous-time Markov chain on a bidirected graph, and the density-feedback laws are designed to prevent the agents from switching between states at equilibrium.	Semantic Scholar
First, we use classical linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based tools to synthesize linear feedback laws that (locally) exponentially stabilize the desired equilibrium distribution of the corresponding mean-field model.	Semantic Scholar
Since these feedback laws violate positivity constraints on the control inputs, we construct rational feedback laws that respect these constraints and have the same stabilizing properties as the original feedback laws.	Semantic Scholar
Next, we present a sum-of-squares (SOS)-based approach to constructing polynomial feedback laws that globally stabilize an equilibrium distribution and also satisfy the positivity constraints.	Semantic Scholar
We validate the effectiveness of these control laws through numerical simulations with different agent populations and graph sizes and through multirobot experiments on spatial redistribution among four regions.	Semantic Scholar
Robotic and animal mapping systems share many challenges and characteristics: they must function in a wide variety of environmental conditions, enable the robot or animal to navigate effectively to find food or shelter, and be computationally tractable from both a speed and storage perspective.	Semantic Scholar
With regards to map storage, the mammalian brain appears to take a diametrically opposed approach to all current robotic mapping systems.	Semantic Scholar
Where robotic mapping systems attempt to solve the data association problem to minimize representational aliasing, neurons in the brain intentionally break data association by encoding large (potentially unlimited) numbers of places with a single neuron.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a novel method based on supervised learning techniques that seeks out regularly repeating visual patterns in the environment with mutually complementary co-prime frequencies, and an encoding scheme that enables storage requirements to grow sublinearly with the size of the environment being mapped.	Semantic Scholar
To improve robustness in challenging real-world environments while maintaining storage growth sublinearity, we incorporate both multiexemplar learning and data augmentation techniques.	Semantic Scholar
Using large benchmark robotic mapping datasets, we demonstrate the combined system achieving high-performance place recognition with sublinear storage requirements and characterize the performance-storage growth tradeoff curve.	Semantic Scholar
The work serves as the first robotic mapping system with sublinear storage scaling properties, as well as the first large-scale demonstration in real-world environments of one of the proposed memory benefits of these neurons.	Semantic Scholar
Over the past several decades, as affordable computational power has increased, simulation has become increasingly important in robot analysis, planning, and control.	Semantic Scholar
Smooth robot dynamics can be simulated efficiently and accurately, and therefore, readily used in model-based control schemes.	Semantic Scholar
However, some of the most difficult and important problems in robotics, such as running, grasping, and parts assembly, involve intermittent frictional contacts, which introduce extreme nonlinearities into the dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
Numerous approaches have been developed to simulate contact dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
Even though real bodies are not rigid, idealized rigid contact models have been used widely and productively for decades.	Semantic Scholar
However, the resulting nonsmooth dynamics can be computationally difficult to solve or use in model-based planning and control, motivating researchers to propose various relaxations of the idealized contact models.	Semantic Scholar
The varied origins and formulations of these approaches can obscure their similarities and differences.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we identify and explain differences between four contact models.	Semantic Scholar
We present the models in the context of one solver that is applicable to all of them, namely Projected Gauss-Seidel, in order to highlight their common structure and to avoid confounding their comparison with differences in the solution methods.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation results from sliding, wedging, grasping, and stacking experiments illustrate consequences of the differences.	Semantic Scholar
The results can help inform roboticists when comparing and selecting models for their specific applications.	Semantic Scholar
Achieving cutting-edge mechanical properties of metal parts realized by additive manufacturing (AM) demands articulated process control strategies, due to the multitude of physical phenomena involved in this kind of manufacturing processes.	Semantic Scholar
Complexity is even higher for what concerns the direct energy deposition (DED) technique, which offers much more potential flexibility and efficiency with respect to other metal AM technologies, at the cost of more difficult process control.	Semantic Scholar
The present work presents a multisensor approach able to combine online signals, collected while monitoring the deposition process, and data coming from offline inspection devices, during the built part quality check phase.	Semantic Scholar
This data fusion approach constitutes the foundation for the process modeling phase and, consequently, for the implementation of an intelligent control strategy that would act online by adjusting the machine process parameters chasing part dimensional, mechanical, and quality targets.	Semantic Scholar
The benefits of the proposed solution are assessed through a dedicated experimental campaign on a DED machine.	Semantic Scholar
The detection of anomalous executions is valuable for reducing potential hazards in assistive manipulation.	Semantic Scholar
Multimodal sensory signals can be helpful for detecting a wide range of anomalies.	Semantic Scholar
However, the fusion of high-dimensional and heterogeneous modalities is a challenging problem for model-based anomaly detection.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce a long short-term memory-based variational autoencoder (LSTM-VAE) that fuses signals and reconstructs their expected distribution by introducing a progress-based varying prior.	Semantic Scholar
Our LSTM-VAE-based detector reports an anomaly when a reconstruction-based anomaly score is higher than a state-based threshold.	Semantic Scholar
For evaluations with 1555 robot-assisted feeding executions, including 12 representative types of anomalies, our detector had a higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.8710 than 5 other baseline detectors from the literature.	Semantic Scholar
We also show the variational autoencoding and state-based thresholding are effective in detecting anomalies from 17 raw sensory signals without significant feature engineering effort.	Semantic Scholar
This paper discusses motion planning for anthropomorphic dual-arm robots.	Semantic Scholar
It introduces a measure of the similarity of the movements needed to solve two given tasks.	Semantic Scholar

In this work, we were interested in creating a robot service for offering help to people who appear to be in need for guidance.	Semantic Scholar
In order to achieve that, we first developed a technique to detect pedestrians who walk in an atypical way (e.g., people who do not know their way).	Semantic Scholar
In our approach, a motion model of typical pedestrians developed in our previous work was used, and a novel predictability feature was defined that quantifies how well can a person's future position be predicted using that model.	Semantic Scholar
The classification method based on this feature gave accurate results and outperformed alternative methods.	Semantic Scholar
Using this detection method, we created a robot service for offering guidance to people who were classified as atypical.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments done in a shopping mall have shown that the robot was successful in choosing the people to approach, and the reactions from users in the interviews were very positive.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents the design, modeling, and control of a meso-scale torsion actuator based on shape memory alloy (SMA) for image-guided surgical procedures.	Semantic Scholar
Developing a miniature torsion actuator is challenging, but it opens the possibility of significantly enhancing the robot agility and maneuverability.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed torsion actuator is bidirectionally actuated by a pair of antagonistic SMA torsion springs through alternate Joule heating and natural cooling.	Semantic Scholar
The torsion actuator is integrated into a surgical robot prototype to demonstrate its working performance in the humid environment under C-Arm CT image guidance.	Semantic Scholar
The aim of this letter is to propose a theory of deep restricted kernel machines offering new foundations for deep learning with kernel machines.	Semantic Scholar
From the viewpoint of deep learning, it is partially related to restricted Boltzmann machines, which are characterized by visible and hidden units in a bipartite graph without hidden-to-hidden connections and deep learning extensions as deep belief networks and deep Boltzmann machines.	Semantic Scholar
From the viewpoint of kernel machines, it includes least squares support vector machines for classification and regression, kernel principal component analysis (PCA), matrix singular value decomposition, and Parzen-type models.	Semantic Scholar
A key element is to first characterize these kernel machines in terms of so-called conjugate feature duality, yielding a representation with visible and hidden units.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown how this is related to the energy form in restricted Boltzmann machines, with continuous variables in a nonprobabilistic setting.	Semantic Scholar
In this new framework of so-called restricted kernel machine (RKM) representations, the dual variables correspond to hidden features.	Semantic Scholar
Deep RKM are obtained by coupling the RKMs.	Semantic Scholar
The method is illustrated for deep RKM, consisting of three levels with a least squares support vector machine regression level and two kernel PCA levels.	Semantic Scholar
In its primal form also deep feedforward neural networks can be trained within this framework.	Semantic Scholar
We consider the problem in which a supervisor or remote pilot provides a real-time linear velocity reference to a multirotor aerial robot, either through a traditional remote control handset, a modern haptic interface, or semi-autonomous guidance control system.	Semantic Scholar
In all such cases, the goal is to servo-control the vehicle's velocity to the set point as quickly and as efficiently as possible.	Semantic Scholar
The challenge is to achieve this robustly in the presence of unknown wind disturbances and in situations in which the vehicle moves into global position system (GPS) denied environments (indoors, urban canyons, forests) where estimation of the vehicle's velocity is challenging.	Semantic Scholar
These situations include unclutterred environments, poor visibility environments caused by poor lighting, and poorly textured visual environments where laser- and vision-based sensors become unreliable.	Semantic Scholar
The approach taken is to develop a coupled nonlinear complementary velocity aided attitude filter that provides estimates of both the inertial and body-fixed frame linear velocities, as well as the attitude of a multirotor aerial vehicle, that functions effectively even when only the inertial measurement unit and barometric sensor measurements are available.	Semantic Scholar
When full inertial velocity measurements are available (from GPS, Vicon, or a vision system), the filter additionally estimates the external wind speed.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we formally present the proposed filter along with experimental results and a comparison of the filter to recent results in the literature and in situations in which inertial reference frame velocities are available intermittently.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed filter is computationally simple to implement, easy to calibrate and tune, and provides an excellent base level functionality for modern multirotor aerial robotic systems that will be required to function robustly in a variety of environments.	Semantic Scholar

Humanoids are, by definition, robotic systems for which the control of interaction forces with the environment is elemental for the accomplishment of any loco-manipulation task.	Semantic Scholar
Any feedback controller of the interaction forces would invariably require some form of measure or estimation of the forces actually exchanged between the robot and the environment.	Semantic Scholar
This paper describes a method for estimating the contact forces for humanoids physically interacting with the environment.	Semantic Scholar
While analogous problems have been solved in the case of serial chain manipulators, the same study is missing for humanoids.	Semantic Scholar
With respect to the estimation problem for manipulators, these robotic systems introduce some peculiar challenges related to the presence of redundantly actuated kinematic loops.	Semantic Scholar
The considered interaction is not limited to specific points of the humanoid body since the proposed method also allows localization of the contact point without resorting to other sensing techniques, like, e.g., vision.	Semantic Scholar
The method has been extensively tested on the humanoid NAO.	Semantic Scholar
Limitations of approximation capabilities of shallow perceptron networks are investigated.	Semantic Scholar
Lower bounds on approximation errors are derived for binary-valued functions on finite domains.	Semantic Scholar
It is proven that unless the number of network units is sufficiently large (larger than any polynomial of the logarithm of the size of the domain) a good approximation cannot be achieved for almost any uniformly randomly chosen function on a given domain.	Semantic Scholar
The results are obtained by combining probabilistic Chernoff-Hoeffding bounds with estimates of the sizes of sets of functions exactly computable by shallow networks with increasing numbers of units.	Semantic Scholar
The ability to classify objects is fundamental for robots.	Semantic Scholar
Besides knowledge about their visual appearance, captured by the RGB channel, robots heavily need also depth information to make sense of the world.	Semantic Scholar
While the use of deep networks on RGB robot images has benefited from the plethora of results obtained on databases like ImageNet, using convnets on depth images requires mapping them into three-dimensional channels.	Semantic Scholar
This transfer learning procedure makes them processable by pretrained deep architectures.	Semantic Scholar
Current mappings are based on heuristic assumptions over preprocessing steps and on what depth properties should be most preserved, resulting often in cumbersome data visualizations, and in suboptimal performance in terms of generality and recognition results.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we take an alternative route and we attempt instead to learn an optimal colorization mapping for any given pretrained architecture, using as training data a reference RGB-D database.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a deep network architecture, exploiting the residual paradigm, that learns how to map depth data to three channel images.	Semantic Scholar
A qualitative analysis of the images obtained with this approach clearly indicates that learning the optimal mapping preserves the richness of depth information better than current hand-crafted approaches.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on the Washington, JHUIT-50 and BigBIRD public benchmark databases, using CaffeNet, VGG-16, GoogleNet, and ResNet50 clearly showcase the power of our approach, with gains in performance of up to 16% compared to state of the art competitors on the depth channel only, leading to top performances when dealing with RGB-D data.

The computational capabilities of today's smartphones make it possible to take advantage of mobile three-dimensional (3-D) maps to support navigation in the physical world.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, 3-D maps might be useful to facilitate indoor wayfinding in large and complex buildings, where the typical orientation cues (e.g., street names) and location tracking technologies that can be used outdoors are unavailable.	Semantic Scholar
The use of mobile 3-D maps for indoor wayfinding is still largely unexplored and research on how to best design such tools has been scarce to date.	Semantic Scholar
One overlooked but important design decision for 3-D maps concerns the perspective from which the map content should be displayed, with first-person and third-person perspectives being the two major options.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a user study involving wayfinding tasks in a large and complex building, comparing a mobile 3-D map with first-person perspective, a mobile 3-D map with third-person perspective, and a traditional mobile 2-D map.	Semantic Scholar
The first-person perspective shows the mobile 3-D map of the building from a floor-level egocentric point of view, whereas the third-person perspective shows the surroundings of the user from a fixed distance behind and above her position.	Semantic Scholar
Results of the study reveal that the mobile 3-D map with third-person perspective leads to shorter orientation time before walking, better clarity ratings, lower workload, mental demand and effort scores, and higher preference score compared to the mobile 3-D map with first-person perspective.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, it leads to shorter orientation time before walking, better pleasantness ratings, lower mental demand scores, and higher preference score compared to the mobile 2-D map.	Semantic Scholar
Cloud manufacturing (CMfg) has emerged as a next-generation manufacturing paradigm that has potential to revolutionize the manufacturing industry.	Semantic Scholar
In further promotion of CMfg, how to build CMfg services in an automatic and efficient manner is an essential and challenging subject.	Semantic Scholar
Currently, there is no literature addressing such issue.	Semantic Scholar
Aimed at facilitating rapid construction of CMfg services, this letter proposes a novel automated construction scheme for developing CMfg services, called Manufacturing Service Automated Construction Scheme (MSACS).	Semantic Scholar
First, we develop a three-phase workflow of MSACS to address the issues of how to construct CMfg services automatically using standalone software library package (SSLP).	Semantic Scholar
Next, we design a system architecture of MSACS to delineate how to implement MSACS.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we depict the designs of MSACS's core components.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we apply MSACS to conduct industrial case studies to build the automatic virtual metrology cloud service and intelligent yield management cloud service for an intelligent manufacturing platform.	Semantic Scholar
Testing results demonstrate that MSACS can automatically construct the target CMfg services in a very efficient manner after uploading the required SSLPs.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, MSACS can significantly alleviate the burden of engineers in building CMfg services, and in turn can facilitate the promotion of CMfg.	Semantic Scholar
A new approach to tracking control of industrial robot manipulators is presented in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
The highly coupled nonlinear dynamics of a six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) serial robot is decoupled by expressing its variables as a function of a flat output and its derivatives.	Semantic Scholar
Hence the derivation of the flat output for the 6-DOF robot is presented.	Semantic Scholar
With the flat output, trajectories for each of the generalised coordinates are easily designed and open loop control is made possible.	Semantic Scholar
Using MATLAB/Simulink S-functions combined with the differential flatness property of the robot, trajectory tracking is carried out in closed loop by using a linear flat controller.	Semantic Scholar
The merit of this approach reduces the computational complexity of the robot dynamics by allowing online computation of a high order system at a lower computational cost.	Semantic Scholar
Using the same processor, the run time for tracking arbitrary trajectories is reduced significantly to about 10 seconds as compared to 30 minutes in the original study(1).	Semantic Scholar
The design is taken further by including a Jacobian transformation for tracking of trajectories in cartesian space.	Semantic Scholar
Simulations using the ABB IRB140 industrial robot with full dynamics is used to validate the study.	Semantic Scholar
One-sided matching mechanisms are fundamental for assigning a set of indivisible objects to a set of self-interested agents when monetary transfers are not allowed.	Semantic Scholar
Two widely-studied randomized mechanisms in multiagent settings are the Random Serial Dictatorship (RSD) and the Probabilistic Serial Rule (PS).	Semantic Scholar
Both mechanisms require only that agents specify ordinal preferences and have a number of desirable economic and computational properties.	Semantic Scholar
However, the induced outcomes of the mechanisms are often incomparable and thus there are challenges when it comes to deciding which mechanism to adopt in practice.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we first consider the space of general ordinal preferences and provide empirical results on the (in)comparability of RSD and PS.	Semantic Scholar
We analyze their respective economic properties under general and lexicographic preferences.	Semantic Scholar
We then instantiate utility functions with the goal of gaining insights on the manipulability, efficiency, and envyfreeness of the mechanisms under different risk-attitude models.	Semantic Scholar
Our results hold under various preference distribution models, which further confirm the broad use of RSD in most practical applications.	Semantic Scholar

In autonomous drone racing, a drone is required to fly through the gates quickly without any collision.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, it is important to detect the gates reliably using computer vision.	Semantic Scholar
However, due to the complications such as varying lighting conditions and gates seen overlapped, traditional image processing algorithms based on color and geometry of the gates tend to fail during the actual racing.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we introduce a convolutional neural network to estimate the center of a gate robustly.	Semantic Scholar
Using the detection results, we apply a line-of-sight guidance algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed algorithm is implemented using low cost, off-the-shelf hardware for validation.	Semantic Scholar
All vision processing is performed in real time on the onboard NVIDIA Jetson TX2 embedded computer.	Semantic Scholar
In a number of tests our proposed framework successfully exhibited fast and reliable detection and navigation performance in indoor environment.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a new approach for indexing real feature vectors in high dimensional space.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach is developed based on Pair-wisely Optimized Clustering tree (POC-tree) that exploits the benefit of hierarchical clustering and Voronoi decomposition.	Semantic Scholar
The POC-tree maximizes the separation space of every pair of clusters at each level of decomposition, making a compact representation of the underlying data.	Semantic Scholar
Searching in the POC-tree is efficiently driven by the bandwidth search strategy.	Semantic Scholar
A single POC-tree can be used to create effective index of data for both exact and approximate nearest neighbour search.	Semantic Scholar
We also present a new method to combine multiple weak POC-trees for boosting the search performance for specific datasets in very high dimensional space.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the proposed approach in which it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for all the datasets used in our experiments.	Semantic Scholar

Uncertain data has posed a great challenge to traditional clustering algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, several algorithms have been proposed for clustering uncertain data, and among them density-based techniques seem promising for handling data uncertainty.	Semantic Scholar
However, some issues like losing uncertain information, high time complexity and nonadaptive threshold have not been addressed well in the previous density-based algorithm FDBSCAN and hierarchical density-based algorithm FOPTICS.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we firstly propose a novel density-based algorithm PDBSCAN, which improves the previous FDBSCAN from the following aspects: (1) it employs a more accurate method to compute the probability that the distance between two uncertain objects is less than or equal to a boundary value, instead of the sampling-based method in FDBSCAN; (2) it introduces new definitions of probability neighborhood, support degree, core object probability, direct reachability probability, thus reducing the complexity and solving the issue of nonadaptive threshold (for core object judgement) in FDBSCAN.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we modify the algorithm PDBSCAN to an improved version (PDBSCANi), by using a better cluster assignment strategy to ensure that every object will be assigned to the most appropriate cluster, thus solving the issue of nonadaptive threshold (for direct density reachability judgement) in FDBSCAN.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, as PDBSCAN and PDBSCANi have difficulties for clustering uncertain data with non-uniform cluster density, we propose a novel hierarchical density-based algorithm POPTICS by extending the definitions of PDBSCAN, adding new definitions of fuzzy core distance and fuzzy reachability distance, and employing a new clustering framework.	Semantic Scholar
POPTICS can reveal the cluster structures of the datasets with different local densities in different regions better than PDBSCAN and PDBSCANi, and it addresses the issues in FOPTICS.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithms over the existing algorithms in accuracy and efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
To meet the immediate needs of environmental monitoring or hazardous event detection, we consider the automatic deployment of a group of low-cost or disposable sensors by a drone.	Semantic Scholar
Introducing sensors by drones to an environment instead of humans has advantages in terms of worker safety and time requirements.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we define “sensor scattering (SS) ” as the problem of maximizing the information-theoretic gain from sensors scattered on the ground by a drone.	Semantic Scholar
SS is challenging due to its combinatorial explosion nature, because the number of possible combination of sensor positions increases exponentially with the increase in the number of sensors.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose an online planning method called submodular optimization sensor scattering (SuMo-SS).	Semantic Scholar
Unlike existing methods, the proposed method can deal with uncertainty in sensor positions.	Semantic Scholar
It does not suffer from combinatorial explosion but obtains a $(1-1/e)$ -approximation of the optimal solution.	Semantic Scholar
We built a physical drone that can scatter sensors in an indoor environment as well as a simulation environment based on the drone and the environment.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present the theoretical background of our proposed method and its experimental validation.	Semantic Scholar
This paper investigates the problem of globally exponential synchronization of coupled neural networks with hybrid impulses.	Semantic Scholar
Two new concepts on average impulsive interval and average impulsive gain are proposed to deal with the difficulties coming from hybrid impulses.	Semantic Scholar
By employing the Lyapunov method combined with some mathematical analysis, some efficient unified criteria are obtained to guarantee the globally exponential synchronization of impulsive networks.	Semantic Scholar
Our method and criteria are proved to be effective for impulsively coupled neural networks simultaneously with synchronizing impulses and desynchronizing impulses, and we do not need to discuss these two kinds of impulses separately.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, by using our average impulsive interval method, we can obtain an interesting and valuable result for the case of average impulsive interval Ta=∞.	Semantic Scholar
For some sparse impulsive sequences with Ta=∞, the impulses can happen for infinite number of times, but they do not have essential influence on the synchronization property of networks.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, numerical examples including scale-free networks are exploited to illustrate our theoretical results.	Semantic Scholar
Under the goal-driven paradigm, Yamins et al.	Semantic Scholar
(2014; Yamins & DiCarlo, 2016) have shown that by optimizing only the final eight-way categorization performance of a four-layer hierarchical network, not only can its top output layer quantitatively predict IT neuron responses but its penultimate layer can also automatically predict V4 neuron responses.	Semantic Scholar
Currently, deep neural networks (DNNs) in the field of computer vision have reached image object categorization performance comparable to that of human beings on ImageNet, a data set that contains 1.3 million training images of 1000 categories.	Semantic Scholar
We explore whether the DNN neurons (units in DNNs) possess image object representational statistics similar to monkey IT neurons, particularly when the network becomes deeper and the number of image categories becomes larger, using VGG19, a typical and widely used deep network of 19 layers in the computer vision field.	Semantic Scholar
Following Lehky, Kiani, Esteky, and Tanaka (2011, 2014), where the response statistics of 674 IT neurons to 806 image stimuli are analyzed using three measures (kurtosis, Pareto tail index, and intrinsic dimensionality), we investigate the three issues in this letter using the same three measures: (1) the similarities and differences of the neural response statistics between VGG19 and primate IT cortex, (2) the variation trends of the response statistics of VGG19 neurons at different layers from low to high, and (3) the variation trends of the response statistics of VGG19 neurons when the numbers of stimuli and neurons increase.	Semantic Scholar
We find that the response statistics on both single-neuron selectivity and population sparseness of VGG19 neurons are fundamentally different from those of IT neurons in most cases; by increasing the number of neurons in different layers and the number of stimuli, the response statistics of neurons at different layers from low to high do not substantially change; and the estimated intrinsic dimensionality values at the low convolutional layers of VGG19 are considerably larger than the value of approximately 100 reported for IT neurons in Lehky et al.	Semantic Scholar
(2014), whereas those at the high fully connected layers are close to or lower than 100.	Semantic Scholar
To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to analyze the response statistics of DNN neurons with respect to primate IT neurons in image object representation.	Semantic Scholar

Most behavioral evidence can be explained by the gradient account, but a key finding unexplained by gradients is intermediate transposition, where a central (of three) stimulus, “relationally correct response,” is generalized from training to test.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we introduce a dynamic neural field (DNF) model that captures intermediate transposition effects while using neural mechanisms closely resembling those of Spence's original proposal.	Semantic Scholar
The DNF model operates on dynamic rather than linear neural relationships, but it still functions by way of gradient interactions, and it does not invoke relational conceptual understanding in order to explain transposition behaviors.	Semantic Scholar
In addition to intermediate transposition, the DNF model also replicates the predictions of stimulus discrimination theory with respect to basic two-stimulus transposition.	Semantic Scholar
Effects of wider test item spacing were additionally captured.	Semantic Scholar
Overall, the DNF model captures a wider range of effects in transposition than stimulus discrimination theory, uses more fully specified neural mechanics, and integrates transposition into a wider modeling effort across cognitive tasks and phenomena.	Semantic Scholar
At the same time, the model features a similar low-level focus and emphasis on gradient interactions as Spence's, serving as a conceptual continuation and updating of Spence's work in the field of transposition.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a new theoretical design of nonlinear optimal control on achieving chaotic synchronization for coupled stochastic neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
To obtain an optimal control law, the proposed approach is developed rigorously by using Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, Lyapunov technique, and inverse optimality, and hence guarantees that the chaotic drive network synchronizes with the chaotic response network influenced by uncertain noise signals.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the paper provides four numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	Semantic Scholar
In the domain of multi-robot path-planning problems, robots must move from their start locations to their goal locations while avoiding collisions with each other.	Semantic Scholar
The research problem that we addressed is to find a complete solution for the multi-robot path-planning problem.	Semantic Scholar
Our first contribution is to recognize the solvable instances of the problem with our solvability test; the theoretical analysis has already been provided to show the validity of this test.	Semantic Scholar
Our second contribution is to solve this problem completely, in polynomial time, with the Push and Spin (PASp) algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Once the problem was solved, we found decisions within the complete solution that may improve the performance of the complete algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, our third contribution is to improve the performance by selecting the best path from the set of complete paths.	Semantic Scholar
We refer to the improved version of our algorithm as the improved PASp algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
In terms of the completeness evaluation, the mathematical proofs demonstrate that the PASp is a complete algorithm for a wider class of problem instances than the classes solved by the Push and Swap (PAS), Push and Rotate (PAR), Bibox or the tractable multi-robot path-planning (MAPP) algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, PASp solves any graph recognized to be solvable without any assumptions.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the theoretical proof of the PASp algorithm showed completive polynomial performance in terms of total-path-lengths and execution time.	Semantic Scholar
In our performance evaluation, the experimental results showed that the PASp performs competitively, in reasonable execution time, in terms of number of moves compared to the PAS, PAR, Bibox and MAPP algorithms on a set of benchmark problems from the video-game industry.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the results showed the scalability and robustness of PASp in problems that can be solved only by PASp.	Semantic Scholar
Such problems require high levels of coordination with an efficient number of moves and short execution time.	Semantic Scholar
In grid and bi-connected graphs with too many cycles, PASp required more moves and more time than the PAS, PAR and Bibox algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
However, PASp is the only algorithm capable of solving such instances with only one unoccupied vertex.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, adding heuristic search and smooth operation to the improved PASp showed significant further improvement by reducing the number of moves for all problem instances.	Semantic Scholar
PASp produced the best plans in a bit higher time.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the PASp algorithm solves a wider class of problems and performs more completely in very complex/crowded environments than other state-of-art algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, the Spin operation introduces a novel swapping technique to exchange two items and restore others in a graph for industrial applications.	Semantic Scholar
Localization in 3-D point clouds is a highly challenging task due to the complexity associated with extracting information from 3-D data.	Semantic Scholar
This letter proposes an incremental approach addressing this problem efficiently.	Semantic Scholar
The presented method first accumulates the measurements in a dynamic voxel grid and selectively updates the point normals affected by the insertion.	Semantic Scholar
An incremental segmentation algorithm, based on region growing, tracks the evolution of single segments, which enables an efficient recognition strategy using partitioning and caching of geometric consistencies.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the incremental method can perform global localization at 10 Hz in an urban driving environment, a speedup of $\times$7.1 over the compared batch solution.	Semantic Scholar
The efficiency of the method makes it suitable for applications where real-time localization is required and enables its usage on cheaper low-energy systems.	Semantic Scholar
Our implementation is available open source along with instructions for running the system.	Semantic Scholar
(The implementation is available at  https://github.com/ethz-asl/segmatch and a video demonstration is available at https://youtu.be/cHfs3HLzc2Y .)	Semantic Scholar
Sports, especially badminton, require participants to perform dynamic and skillful motions.	Semantic Scholar
Previous robots have had difficulty in performing like a human because of their severe limitations of low operating speed, heavy bodies, and simplistic mechanisms.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a new robot design that consists of a structure integrated with pneumatic actuators and noninterfering many-degree-of-freedom joints, for the realization of a high-speed and lightweight humanoid robot.	Semantic Scholar
We made a four-degree-of-freedom robot arm for badminton, which is an especially dynamic sport, aiming for maximum speed while meeting geometric requirements.	Semantic Scholar
The robot swung with a racket-head speed of 21 m/s, which is a value higher than speeds achieved by previous robotic arms.	Semantic Scholar
The robot also realized a skillful shot, namely the spin net shot, which cannot be performed by previous badminton robots having simple mechanisms.	Semantic Scholar
A pneumatic robot is considered difficult to control, especially in terms of feedback control.	Semantic Scholar
We found that the reproducibility of the robot was as fine as 10–40 mm at the racket head for four kinds of strong swings.	Semantic Scholar
Using feedforward control, we also conducted an experiment in which the robot hits a flying shuttle, and achieved a high hitting rate of 69.7% for powerful swings.	Semantic Scholar
We believe that this research expands the possibilities of the pneumatic robot and is the first step toward developing a skillful humanoid badminton robot.	Semantic Scholar
Serious games are recently becoming a common sight in rehabilitation settings to provide motivation for patients undergoing therapy to regain upper limb function after disability.	Semantic Scholar
These are often presented using a two-dimensional (2-D) monitor to the patient who uses a robotic device (haptic user interface) as the game controller.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we develop a 3-D spatial augmented reality (AR) display to colocate visual and haptic feedback to the user in three rehabilitative games.	Semantic Scholar
The same games are also displayed in a 2-D nonimmersive virtual reality (VR) and are compared against their AR counterpart in terms of user task performance to evaluate the benefit of the 3-D AR system.	Semantic Scholar
To simulate a rehabilitation scenario, able-bodied participants are put under cognitive load (CL) for simulating disability-induced cognitive deficiencies when performing the tasks.	Semantic Scholar
A within-subjects analysis of ten participants was carried out for the rehabilitative games.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that AR leads to the best user performance with or without cognitive loading.	Semantic Scholar
This result is most evident in dynamic exercises where the participants are required to have quick reaction times and fast movement.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, even while AR had a significant difference over VR, one of the tasks showed that the performance in AR between non-CL and CL cases was similar, thereby showing how AR can alleviate the negative effects of CL.	Semantic Scholar
Changes in the motor pattern have been shown to be useful advanced indicators of cognitive disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and cerebral small vessel disease (SVD).	Semantic Scholar
It would be highly advantageous to tap into data containing people's motor patterns from motion sensing devices to analyze subtle changes in cognitive abilities, thereby providing personalized interventions before the actual onset of such conditions.	Semantic Scholar
However, this goal is very challenging due to two main technical problems: 1) the size of data labeled by doctors is small, and 2) the available data tends to be highly imbalanced (the vast majority tend to be from normal subjects with only a small fraction from subjects with cognitive disorder).	Semantic Scholar
In order to effectively deal with these challenges to infer cognitive wellness from motor patterns with high accuracy, we propose the MOtor-Cognitive Analytics (MOCA) framework.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed MOCA first uses the random oversampling iterative random forest based feature selection method to reduce the feature space dimensionality and avoid overfitting, and then adds a bias in the optimization problem of weighted extreme learning machine to achieve good generalization ability in handling imbalanced small-sampling dataset.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on two real-world datasets including SVD and stroke patients show that MOCA can effectively reduce the rate of misdiagnosis and significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in inferring people's cognitive capabilities.	Semantic Scholar
This work opens up opportunities for population-level pre-screening using motion sensing devices and can inform current discussions on reforming the health-care infrastructure.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the lack of direct distance measurements, robust and accurate state estimation at high altitude but GPS-denied environments is a challenging task.	Semantic Scholar
A possible solution is monocular visual–inertial estimators, in which visual and inertial measurements are properly fused to recover the metric estimates.	Semantic Scholar
However, these estimators suffer from initialization under poor numerical conditioning or even degeneration, due to difficulties in retrieving observations of visual features with sufficient parallax, and the excessive period of inertial measurement integration.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we introduce the joint formulation into the spline-based high altitude estimator initialization method for monocular visual–inertial navigation system, in which the fitting of the spline and the alignment of visual measurements and inertial measurements are jointly optimized to recover metric estimates.	Semantic Scholar
The method ensures that sufficient excitation is contained in the inertial measurements when initialized, which eliminates the numerical issues.	Semantic Scholar
Compared with the work of Liu and Shen, the joint formulation makes our initialization method insensitive to the choice of spline parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, the adaptivity to various environments and motions is obtained, as well as higher accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
The method is applicable for both loosely coupled and tightly coupled visual–inertial estimators.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our approach.	Semantic Scholar
This paper focuses on stochastic exponential synchronization of delayed memristive neural networks (MNNs) by the aid of systems with interval parameters which are established by using the concept of Filippov solution.	Semantic Scholar
New intermittent controller and adaptive controller with logarithmic quantization are structured to deal with the difficulties induced by time-varying delays, interval parameters as well as stochastic perturbations, simultaneously.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, not only control cost can be reduced but also communication channels and bandwidth are saved by using these controllers.	Semantic Scholar
Based on novel Lyapunov functions and new analytical methods, several synchronization criteria are established to realize the exponential synchronization of MNNs with stochastic perturbations via intermittent control and adaptive control with or without logarithmic quantization.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, numerical simulations are offered to substantiate our theoretical results.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we address the multi-view subspace clustering problem.	Semantic Scholar
Our method utilizes the circulant algebra for tensor, which is constructed by stacking the subspace representation matrices of different views and then rotating, to capture the low rank tensor subspace so that the refinement of the view-specific subspaces can be achieved, as well as the high order correlations underlying multi-view data can be explored.	Semantic Scholar
By introducing a recently proposed tensor factorization, namely tensor-Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD) (Kilmer et al.	Semantic Scholar
in SIAM J Matrix Anal Appl 34(1):148–172, 2013), we can impose a new type of low-rank tensor constraint on the rotated tensor to ensure the consensus among multiple views.	Semantic Scholar
Different from traditional unfolding based tensor norm, this low-rank tensor constraint has optimality properties similar to that of matrix rank derived from SVD, so the complementary information can be explored and propagated among all the views more thoroughly and effectively.	Semantic Scholar
The established model, called t-SVD based Multi-view Subspace Clustering (t-SVD-MSC), falls into the applicable scope of augmented Lagrangian method, and its minimization problem can be efficiently solved with theoretical convergence guarantee and relatively low computational complexity.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experimental testing on eight challenging image datasets shows that the proposed method has achieved highly competent objective performance compared to several state-of-the-art multi-view clustering methods.	Semantic Scholar
Ball-shaped robots present a novel andwidely studied approach formobile robotics.	Semantic Scholar
Despite the essential benefit of the ball-robot that it cannot flip over or fall down, the robot’s physical construction often severely limits the ball mobility in uneven terrain.	Semantic Scholar
The customarily applied quasi-static motion model makes the anticipated theoretical robotmobility evenworse, because it completely ignores ball dynamics and therefore seriously under-estimates the robot’s obstacle-crossing capability.	Semantic Scholar
The energy-based model, sometimes applied instead of the quasi-static model, over-estimates ball mobility and becomes inconvenient when an active drivingmotor is added to the system.	Semantic Scholar
This paper introduces a new extended dynamic model for flexible pendulum-driven ball-shaped robots, as well as a simulation-based method to predict the robot’s step-crossing capability.	Semantic Scholar
The extended dynamic model allows rolling, bouncing and slipping of the robot, and it includes a simplified contact model for the ball-obstacle-interaction.	Semantic Scholar
The simulation results have been compared to experimental results obtained with a physical robot.	Semantic Scholar
The comparison shows that the new dynamic model and contact model outperform the traditionally applied quasi-static and energy-based models.	Semantic Scholar
The new dynamic model may be applied in mobility analysis of ball-robot designs, for path planning, as well as for control algorithm development.	Semantic Scholar

In order to address with the problem of the traditional or improved cuckoo search (CS) algorithm, we propose a dynamic adaptive cuckoo search with crossover operator (DACS-CO) algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Normally, the parameters of the CS algorithm are kept constant or adapted by empirical equation that may result in decreasing the efficiency of the algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
In order to solve the problem, a feedback control scheme of algorithm parameters is adopted in cuckoo search; Rechenberg’s 1/5 criterion, combined with a learning strategy, is used to evaluate the evolution process.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, there are no information exchanges between individuals for cuckoo search algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
To promote the search progress and overcome premature convergence, the multiple-point random crossover operator is merged into the CS algorithm to exchange information between individuals and improve the diversification and intensification of the population.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of the proposed hybrid algorithm is investigated through different nonlinear systems, with the numerical results demonstrating that the method can estimate parameters accurately and efficiently.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we compare the results with the standard CS algorithm, orthogonal learning cuckoo search algorithm (OLCS), an adaptive and simulated annealing operation with the cuckoo search algorithm (ACS-SA), a genetic algorithm (GA), a particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO), and a genetic simulated annealing algorithm (GA-SA).

This study considers the 3D human pose estimation problem in a single RGB image by proposing a conditional random field (CRF) model over 2D poses, in which the 3D pose is obtained as a byproduct of the inference process.	Semantic Scholar
The unary term of the proposed CRF model is defined based on a powerful heat-map regression network, which has been proposed for 2D human pose estimation.	Semantic Scholar
This study also presents a regression network for lifting the 2D pose to 3D pose and proposes the prior term based on the consistency between the estimated 3D pose and the 2D pose.	Semantic Scholar
To obtain the approximate solution of the proposed CRF model, the N-best strategy is adopted.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed inference algorithm can be viewed as sequential processes of bottom-up generation of 2D and 3D pose proposals from the input 2D image based on deep networks and top-down verification of such proposals by checking their consistencies.	Semantic Scholar
To evaluate the proposed method, we use two large-scale datasets: Human3.6M and HumanEva.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art 3D human pose estimation performance.	Semantic Scholar
In recent years, vision-aided inertial odometry for state estimation has matured significantly.	Semantic Scholar
However, we still encounter challenges in terms of improving the computational efficiency and robustness of the underlying algorithms for applications in autonomous flight with microaerial vehicles, in which it is difficult to use high-quality sensors and powerful processors because of constraints on size and weight.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a filter-based stereo visual inertial odometry that uses the multistate constraint Kalman filter.	Semantic Scholar
Previous work on the stereo visual inertial odometry has resulted in solutions that are computationally expensive.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate that our stereo multistate constraint Kalman filter (S-MSCKF) is comparable to state-of-the-art monocular solutions in terms of computational cost, while providing significantly greater robustness.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our S-MSCKF algorithm and compare it with state-of-the-art methods including OKVIS, ROVIO, and VINS-MONO on both the EuRoC dataset and our own experimental datasets demonstrating fast autonomous flight with a maximum speed of  $\text{17.5}$ m/s in indoor and outdoor environments.

This paper describes a lower limb exoskeleton control approach that facilitates a desired movement coordination between the hip and knee joints during the swing phase of gait.	Semantic Scholar
An important feature of the proposed controller is that it provides movement guidance while allowing a user to control step time and step length.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, control of step time is enabled by the use of time-invariant movement constraints, while control of step length is enabled by a real-time path-planning feature.	Semantic Scholar
As such, the controller provides movement coordination, but still enables a user to retain the step-to-step variability required to maintain balance during walking.	Semantic Scholar
The controller was implemented on a lower limb exoskeleton and tested on five healthy subjects.	Semantic Scholar
The subjects walked overground in the exoskeleton without a stability aid under two conditions: with the proposed coordination controller (i.e., with sagittal plane movement constraints) and with no control implemented (i.e., without sagittal plane movement constraints).	Semantic Scholar
Data from these assessments indicate that the controller provided substantial movement coordination while still allowing subjects substantive control of step time and length across a range of walking speeds.	Semantic Scholar
Modular robotic systems that integrate distally with commercially available endoscopic equipment have the potential to improve the standard-of-care in therapeutic endoscopy by granting clinicians with capabilities not present in commercial tools, such as precision dexterity and feedback sensing.

With the desire to integrate both sensing and actuation distally for closed-loop position control in fully deployable, endoscope-based robotic modules, commercial sensor and actuator options that acquiesce to the strict form-factor requirements are sparse or nonexistent.	Semantic Scholar
Herein, we describe a proprioceptive angle sensor for potential closed-loop position control applications in distal robotic modules.	Semantic Scholar
Fabricated monolithically using printed-circuit MEMS, the sensor employs a kinematic linkage and the principle of light intensity modulation to sense the angle of articulation with a high degree of fidelity.	Semantic Scholar
Onboard temperature and environmental irradiance measurements, coupled with linear regression techniques, provide robust angle measurements that are insensitive to environmental disturbances.	Semantic Scholar
The sensor is capable of measuring  $\pm$45 degrees of articulation with an RMS error of 0.98 degrees.	Semantic Scholar
An ex vivo demonstration shows that the sensor can give real-time proprioceptive feedback when coupled with an actuator module, opening up the possibility of fully distal closed-loop control.	Semantic Scholar

There have been a lot of methods to address the recognition of complete face images.	Semantic Scholar
However, in real applications, the images to be recognized are usually incomplete, and it is more difficult to realize such a recognition.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a novel convolution neural network frame, named a low-rank-recovery network (LRRNet), is proposed to conquer the difficulty effectively inspired by matrix completion and deep learning techniques.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed LRRNet first recovers the incomplete face images via an approach of matrix completion with the truncated nuclear norm regularization solution, and then extracts some low-rank parts of the recovered images as the filters.	Semantic Scholar
With these filters, some important features are obtained by means of the binaryzation and histogram algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, these features are classified with the classical support vector machines (SVMs).	Semantic Scholar
The proposed LRRNet method has high face recognition rate for the heavily corrupted images, especially for the images in the large databases.	Semantic Scholar

Mobile robots are valuable tools for education because of both the enthusiasm they raise and the multidisciplinary nature of robotics technology.	Semantic Scholar
Mobile robots give access to a wide range of fields, such as complex mechanics, sensors, wireless transmission, mathematics, and computer science.	Semantic Scholar
However, despite their potential as educational tools, robots are still not as widespread in schools as they could be.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we identify five key reasons: lack of diversity, high cost, noninclusive design, lack of educational material, and lack of stability over time.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we describe our answers to these problems, as we implemented them in the Thymio project: a mature mass-produced open-hardware robot, at a low price, with a multiage and gender-neutral feature set, and with a design promoting creativity, facilitating learning, and providing a wide range of interaction possibilities from built-in behaviors to text programming, passing through different visual programming environments.

This study alters various exemplar presentation parameters to determine their effects on human online category learning for a future system that combines humans and computer vision (CV).	Semantic Scholar
Online category learning is necessary in this system because we envision that humans will need to provide input to assist CV modules in determining category labels without reducing throughput and without necessarily having expert knowledge of each category.	Semantic Scholar
In our study, subjects participated in a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation paradigm in which they were asked to determine the target category from highlighted exemplar images interspersed among distractor images.	Semantic Scholar
In Experiment 1, the highlighting method was varied among four options and a negative (no-label) and positive (explicit, text-based) control.	Semantic Scholar
In Experiment 2, label accuracy was altered by incorrectly labeling some distractor and exemplar images.	Semantic Scholar
In both experiments, there were three levels of difficulty that varied the similarity between distractor and exemplar images.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that most highlighting methods resulted in equivalent accuracy to the positive control, but certain modalities were more effective at varying difficulty levels.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the subject accuracy was sensitive to distractors highlighted as targets, but not to nonhighlighted exemplars.	Semantic Scholar

This article describes a process theory based on active inference and belief propagation.	Semantic Scholar
Starting from the premise that all neuronal processing (and action selection) can be explained by maximizing Bayesian model evidence—or minimizing variational free energy—we ask whether neuronal responses can be described as a gradient descent on variational free energy.	Semantic Scholar
Using a standard (Markov decision process) generative model, we derive the neuronal dynamics implicit in this description and reproduce a remarkable range of well-characterized neuronal phenomena.	Semantic Scholar
These include repetition suppression, mismatch negativity, violation responses, place-cell activity, phase precession, theta sequences, theta-gamma coupling, evidence accumulation, race-to-bound dynamics, and transfer of dopamine responses.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the (approximately Bayes’ optimal) behavior prescribed by these dynamics has a degree of face validity, providing a formal explanation for reward seeking, context learning, and epistemic foraging.	Semantic Scholar
Technically, the fact that a gradient descent appears to be a valid description of neuronal activity means that variational free energy is a Lyapunov function for neuronal dynamics, which therefore conform to Hamilton’s principle of least action.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present the design of a shape-memory-alloy (SMA)-based compliant linear actuator [active cell (AC)] and the use of these in designing and modeling articulated meshes, which form the mechanical subsystem of a class of proposed modular active-cell robots (MACROs).	Semantic Scholar
The ACs are capable of undergoing ∼25% strain and groups of cells are connected via passively compliant nodes to produce articulated mesh networks.	Semantic Scholar
The deformation of compliant meshes of ACs is modeled by scale-invariant parametric equations derived from the physics of SMA deformations and a reduced-order model of the cells.	Semantic Scholar
Parameters of the implemented system were used to develop a simulation platform that predicts the mechanical deformation of the networked robot given electrical inputs at arbitrary nodes of the network.	Semantic Scholar
We provide results of several experimental trials used to validate and establish the accuracy of this deformation model.	Semantic Scholar
The error in predicting deformations in small meshes is shown to be under 10% over both time-varying inputs and at steady states.	Semantic Scholar
Extrinsic calibration is one of the most important problems in robotics, whose objective is to estimate the relative poses among the sensors and the robot.	Semantic Scholar
Currently, most on-line solutions of extrinsic calibration are based on the Gaussian filters, which estimate all the system states iteratively.	Semantic Scholar
However, a large number of the system states are not related to calibration.	Semantic Scholar
Estimating all these redundant states may highly increase the dimensionality of the problem, and therefore, undermine the calibration performance in both efficiency and robustness.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose an innovative on-line calibration algorithm, called constraint Gaussian filter with virtual measurements (VMCGF).	Semantic Scholar
The nature of VMCGF is a filter with a compact state vector containing only the states of interest, also called essential states.	Semantic Scholar
Violating the modeling principles of the traditional Gaussian filters, the measurements cannot be expressed by the observation function with the essential states solely.	Semantic Scholar
Exploiting the constraints between the measurements and the essential states, virtual measurements are generated according to the properties of the generalized chi-square distribution.	Semantic Scholar
Although originally developed to solve the calibration problem, VMCGF is a general filtering algorithm, that can be applied to solve other problems that might suffer from redundant states.	Semantic Scholar
The implementation of VMCGF on a camera odometry calibration problem is introduced, and its observability properties are analyzed.	Semantic Scholar
Both simulations and experiments are conducted to validate our algorithm.	Semantic Scholar

We train a binary decoder that can distinguish two different mental states, which is applied in a cascaded manner to efficiently control the exoskeleton in three different directions: walk front, turn left and turn right.	Semantic Scholar
This is realized by first classifying the user’s intention to walk front or change the direction.	Semantic Scholar
If the user decides to change the direction, a subsequent classification is performed to decide turn left or right.	Semantic Scholar
The user’s mental command is conditionally executed considering the possibility of obstacle collision.	Semantic Scholar

Among various excellent solutions, the co-association matrix based methods form a landmark, which redefines consensus clustering as a graph partition problem.	Semantic Scholar
Nevertheless, the relatively high time and space complexities preclude it from wide real-life applications.	Semantic Scholar
We, therefore, propose Spectral Ensemble Clustering (SEC) to leverage the advantages of co-association matrix in information integration but run more efficiently.	Semantic Scholar
We disclose the theoretical equivalence between SEC and weighted K-means clustering, which dramatically reduces the algorithmic complexity.	Semantic Scholar
We also derive the latent consensus function of SEC, which to our best knowledge is the first to bridge co-association matrix based methods to the methods with explicit global objective functions.	Semantic Scholar
Further, we prove in theory that SEC holds the robustness, generalizability, and convergence properties.	Semantic Scholar
We finally extend SEC to meet the challenge arising from incomplete basic partitions, based on which a row-segmentation scheme for big data clustering is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on various real-world data sets in both ensemble and multi-view clustering scenarios demonstrate the superiority of SEC to some state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, SEC seems to be a promising candidate for big data clustering.	Semantic Scholar
A rigorous numerical algorithm, formally verified with Isabelle/HOL, is used to certify the computations that Tucker used to prove chaos for the Lorenz attractor.	Semantic Scholar
The verification is based on a formalization of a diverse variety of mathematics and algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Formalized mathematics include ordinary differential equations and Poincaré maps.	Semantic Scholar
Algorithms include low level approximation schemes based on Runge–Kutta methods and affine arithmetic.	Semantic Scholar
On a high level, reachability analysis is guided by static hybridization and adaptive step-size control and splitting.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithms are systematically refined towards an implementation that can be executed on Tucker’s original input data.	Semantic Scholar
The complex-valued Cohen-Grossberg neural network is a special kind of complex-valued neural network.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, the synchronization problem of a class of complex-valued Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with known and unknown parameters is investigated.	Semantic Scholar
By using Lyapunov functionals and the adaptive control method based on parameter identification, some adaptive feedback schemes are proposed to achieve synchronization exponentially between the drive and response systems.	Semantic Scholar
The results obtained in this paper have extended and improved some previous works on adaptive synchronization of Cohen-Grossberg neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, two numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.	Semantic Scholar
Inspired by the human upper extremity, a musculoskeletal dual-arm manipulator is designed for light machining tasks such as hammering and sawing.	Semantic Scholar
We claim that musculoskeletal structure has the advantage over conventional robot structures in terms of less internal impulsive forces while performing these machining tasks.	Semantic Scholar
We investigated the advantages (in terms of external and internal impulses) of a musculoskeletal dual-arm model over a dual-arm model without muscles, musculoskeletal single arm model, and single arm model without muscles.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, to model the hardness of the material during these tasks, an effective mass model was newly developed and experimentally verified for two different (soft and hard) materials.	Semantic Scholar
In order to validate the proposed methodology, a belted ellipsoid denoting the external and internal impulse geometry is employed to analyze the sawing and hammering tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, it was found by performing a hammering task that the musculoskeletal dual-arm model is more effective in terms of generating more external impulse while experiencing less internal impulses at the joints.	Semantic Scholar
Comprehending different categories of facial expressions plays a great role in the design of computational model analyzing human perceived and affective state.	Semantic Scholar
Authoritative studies have revealed that facial expressions in human daily life are in multiple or co-occurring mental states.	Semantic Scholar
However, due to the lack of valid datasets, most previous studies are still restricted to basic emotions with single label.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a novel multi-label facial expression database, RAF-ML, along with a new deep learning algorithm, to address this problem.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, a crowdsourcing annotation of 1.2 million labels from 315 participants was implemented to identify the multi-label expressions collected from social network, then EM algorithm was designed to filter out unreliable labels.	Semantic Scholar
For all we know, RAF-ML is the first database in the wild that provides with crowdsourced cognition for multi-label expressions.	Semantic Scholar
Focusing on the ambiguity and continuity of blended expressions, we propose a new deep manifold learning network, called Deep Bi-Manifold CNN, to learn the discriminative feature for multi-label expressions by jointly preserving the local affinity of deep features and the manifold structures of emotion labels.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, a deep domain adaption method is leveraged to extend the deep manifold features learned from RAF-ML to other expression databases under various imaging conditions and cultures.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on the RAF-ML and other diverse databases (JAFFE, CK$$+$$ + , SFEW and MMI) show that the deep manifold feature is not only superior in multi-label expression recognition in the wild, but also captures the elemental and generic components that are effective for a wide range of expression recognition tasks.

The objective of this letter is to enhance the accuracy of the monocular visual odometry estimation.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach estimates pose of the camera via direct approach, by minimizing a novel photometric residue between the current image and warped version of the consecutive image.	Semantic Scholar
The novel photometric residue incorporates orientation information accessible from complementary sensor to overcome the inalienable nonlinearity of pose estimation, accordingly lessening the susceptibility to trajectory noise.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, this letter introduces a homography-based rotation motion estimation embedded into the photometric residue to reduce tracking failure amid rotations, which could be attributed to lesser number of features with parallax.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed methodology permits to integrate Gaussian mixture based prior into visual odometry estimation to cater for changes in motion type, from general to rotation and other way round.	Semantic Scholar
Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to exhibit the efficacy of the proposed solution over the best in class visual odometry and visual-inertial systems.	Semantic Scholar
Caging offers a robust strategy for grasping objects with robot hands.	Semantic Scholar
This letter utilizes caging for locking polygonal objects against a wall using minimalistic two-finger robot hands.	Semantic Scholar
From the object's perspective, the wall and two-finger hand form an equivalent three-finger hand.	Semantic Scholar
The object is first caged by trapezoidal finger formations of the equivalent three-finger hand, and the hand is then closed until the object is locked against the wall in the desired grasp.	Semantic Scholar
The object can then be safely grasped and moved away from the wall, or it can be held fixed against it to be worked on by tools.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a novel and efficient caging-to-locking algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
While the equivalent hand's configuration space is four-dimensional, the algorithm uses the hand's two-dimensional contact space, which represents all contacts by two and three of the equivalent hand's fingers along the object boundary.	Semantic Scholar
The problem of computing the critical cage formation that allows the object to escape the equivalent hand is reduced to a search along a caging graph constructed incrementally in the equivalent hand's contact space.	Semantic Scholar
Starting from the desired locking grasp, the graph is searched for an escape path which passes through the critical cage formation.	Semantic Scholar
The technique is demonstrated with a detailed example.	Semantic Scholar
The emergence of massive open online courses (MOOCs) has caused a major impact on online education.	Semantic Scholar
However, learning analytics support for MOOCs still needs to improve to fulfill requirements of instructors and students.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, MOOCs pose challenges for learning analytics tools due to the number of learners, such as scalability in terms of computing time and visualizations.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we present different visualizations of our “Add-on of the learNing AnaLYtics Support for open Edx” (ANALYSE), which is a learning analytics tool that we have designed and implemented for Open edX, based on MOOC features, teacher feedback, and pedagogical foundations.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we provide a technical solution that addresses scalability at two levels: first, in terms of performance scalability, where we propose an architecture for handling massive amounts of data within educational settings; and, second, regarding the representation of visualizations under massiveness conditions, as well as advice on color usage and plot types.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we provide some examples on how to use these visualizations to evaluate student performance and detect problems in resources.	Semantic Scholar
We initiate a mathematical analysis of hidden effects induced by binning spike trains of neurons.	Semantic Scholar
Assuming that the original spike train has been generated by a discrete Markov process, we show that binning generates a stochastic process that is no longer Markov but is instead a variable-length Markov chain (VLMC) with unbounded memory.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that the law of the binned raster is a Gibbs measure in the DLR (Dobrushin-Lanford-Ruelle) sense coined in mathematical statistical mechanics.	Semantic Scholar
This allows the derivation of several important consequences on statistical properties of binned spike trains.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we introduce the DLR framework as a natural setting to mathematically formalize anticipation, that is, to tell “how good” our nervous system is at making predictions.	Semantic Scholar
In a probabilistic sense, this corresponds to condition a process by its future, and we discuss how binning may affect our conclusions on this ability.	Semantic Scholar
We finally comment on the possible consequences of binning in the detection of spurious phase transitions or in the detection of incorrect evidence of criticality.	Semantic Scholar
Inferring mathematical models of sensory processing systems directly from input-output observations, while making the fewest assumptions about the model equations and the types of measurements available, is still a major issue in computational neuroscience.	Semantic Scholar
This letter introduces two new approaches for identifying sensory circuit models consisting of linear and nonlinear filters in series with spiking neuron models, based only on the sampled analog input to the filter and the recorded spike train output of the spiking neuron.	Semantic Scholar
For an ideal integrate-and-fire neuron model, the first algorithm can identify the spiking neuron parameters as well as the structure and parameters of an arbitrary nonlinear filter connected to it.	Semantic Scholar
The second algorithm can identify the parameters of the more general leaky integrate-and-fire spiking neuron model, as well as the parameters of an arbitrary linear filter connected to it.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical studies involving simulated and real experimental recordings are used to demonstrate the applicability and evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms.	Semantic Scholar

We investigate rhythms in networks of neurons with recurrent excitation, that is, with excitatory cells exciting each other.	Semantic Scholar
Recurrent excitation can sustain activity even when the cells in the network are driven below threshold, too weak to fire on their own.	Semantic Scholar
This sort of “reverberating” activity is often thought to be the basis of working memory.	Semantic Scholar
Recurrent excitation can also lead to “runaway” transitions, sudden transitions to high-frequency firing; this may be related to epileptic seizures.	Semantic Scholar
Not all fundamental questions about these phenomena have been answered with clarity in the literature.	Semantic Scholar
We focus on three questions here: (1) How much recurrent excitation is needed to sustain reverberating activity?	Semantic Scholar
How does the answer depend on parameters?	Semantic Scholar
(2) Is there a positive minimum frequency of reverberating activity, a positive “onset frequency”?	Semantic Scholar
How does it depend on parameters?	Semantic Scholar
(3) When do runaway transitions occur?	Semantic Scholar
For reduced models, we give mathematical answers to these questions.	Semantic Scholar
We also examine computationally to which extent our findings are reflected in the behavior of biophysically more realistic model networks.	Semantic Scholar
Our main results can be summarized as follows.	Semantic Scholar
(1) Reverberating activity can be fueled by extremely weak slow recurrent excitation, but only by sufficiently strong fast recurrent excitation.	Semantic Scholar
(2) The onset of reverberating activity, as recurrent excitation is strengthened or external drive is raised, occurs at a positive frequency.	Semantic Scholar
It is faster when the external drive is weaker (and the recurrent excitation stronger).	Semantic Scholar
It is slower when the recurrent excitation has a longer decay time constant.	Semantic Scholar
(3) Runaway transitions occur only with fast, not with slow, recurrent excitation.	Semantic Scholar
We also demonstrate that the relation between reverberating activity fueled by recurrent excitation and runaway transitions can be visualized in an instructive way by a (generalized) cusp catastrophe surface.	Semantic Scholar
Grasping is a complex process involving knowledge of the object, the surroundings, and of oneself.	Semantic Scholar
While humans are able to integrate and process all of the sensory information required for performing this task, equipping machines with this capability is an extremely challenging endeavor.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we investigate how deep learning techniques can allow us to translate high-level concepts such as motor imagery to the problem of robotic grasp synthesis.	Semantic Scholar
We explore a paradigm based on generative models for learning integrated object-action representations and demonstrate its capacity for capturing and generating multimodal multifinger grasp configurations on a simulated grasping dataset.	Semantic Scholar
Semantic understanding of visual scenes is one of the holy grails of computer vision.	Semantic Scholar
Despite efforts of the community in data collection, there are still few image datasets covering a wide range of scenes and object categories with pixel-wise annotations for scene understanding.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we present a densely annotated dataset ADE20K, which spans diverse annotations of scenes, objects, parts of objects, and in some cases even parts of parts.	Semantic Scholar
Totally there are 25k images of the complex everyday scenes containing a variety of objects in their natural spatial context.	Semantic Scholar
On average there are 19.5 instances and 10.5 object classes per image.	Semantic Scholar
Based on ADE20K, we construct benchmarks for scene parsing and instance segmentation.	Semantic Scholar
We provide baseline performances on both of the benchmarks and re-implement state-of-the-art models for open source.	Semantic Scholar
We further evaluate the effect of synchronized batch normalization and find that a reasonably large batch size is crucial for the semantic segmentation performance.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the networks trained on ADE20K are able to segment a wide variety of scenes and objects.	Semantic Scholar

Hand-gesture-based commands may replace touch and electromechanical input panels to make public interactive response systems (IRS) more accessible.	Semantic Scholar
This work presents a prototype framework for vision-based mid-air unistroke character input, which can be adapted as an interface for the IRS.	Semantic Scholar
At first, we developed an acquisition module that effectively spots the legitimate gesture trajectory by implementing pen-up and pen-down actions using depth thresholding and velocity tracking.	Semantic Scholar
The extracted trajectory is recognized through a novel, fast, and easy to implement the equipolar signature (EPS) technique.	Semantic Scholar
Apart from resistance to rotation, scale, and translation variations, EPS exhibits neutrality to stroking directions as well.	Semantic Scholar
On the three self-collected datasets comprising of digits, alphabets, and symbols, the EPS scheme obtains over 96.5% accurate results with an average of 30-ms running time.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed scheme is also validated on an open dataset DAIR (Dataset for AIR Handwriting), where it achieves 95.5% mean accuracy with 24.3-ms recognition time per gesture.	Semantic Scholar
The developed approach is compared with benchmark schemes to justify its accuracy and speed.	Semantic Scholar
We present variable amplitude module orthogonal slider (VAMOS), a novel two-motor hexapedal robot that is able to walk and turn with arbitrary curvature.	Semantic Scholar
The VAMOS walking mechanism is based around a variable amplitude module (VAM), a compact and modular gearbox that produces reciprocating sinusoidal output of continuously variable amplitude.	Semantic Scholar
The inputs to the VAM are a drive motor, rotating at a constant speed, and a single control input for changing the output amplitude.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike other methods for amplitude modulation, the VAM does not require modulation of the main drive input and we can, therefore, operate it at peak efficiency thoughout the gait cycle.	Semantic Scholar
As demonstrated by VAMOS, the VAM provides a versatile building block for biomimetic robotic gaits.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a fully-integrated end-effector positioning system for large-scale multi-robotic setups used for non-repetitive manufacturing tasks.	Semantic Scholar
The system provides static and dynamic correction of the end-effector pose using an external pose tracking system.	Semantic Scholar
It consists of multiple modules, which extend the capabilities of the conventional robot setup and fundamentally improve its usability and efficiency, since the user can easily set up, execute, and monitor the manufacturing tasks in a universal reference frame.	Semantic Scholar
To increase the performance of closed-loop control of the end-effector pose, a sensor fusion algorithm is implemented for fusing the data of the tracking system iGPS with an IMU.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments are carried out, which show a reduction of the average error down to 0.10 mm for the static correction, a significant increase of the measurement quality of the tracking system with the sensor fusion, and a path error below 0.5 mm for the dynamic correction.	Semantic Scholar
The presented correction system enables new applications in digital building construction, which require high accuracy target poses spread throughout a large workspace of cooperating robots.	Semantic Scholar
This letter addresses the influences of footpad shape and ground condition on the motion behavior of a lander in a vacuum.	Semantic Scholar
To evaluate the influences, we first developed a drop test apparatus that can conduct repeated drop tests in the vacuum chamber.	Semantic Scholar
The footpad drop tests were then conducted with various shaped footpads on different surface conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Subsequently, the motion behavior of the footpads in a vacuum was modeled, based on the resistance force theory (RFT) and its penetration characteristics were numerically analyzed.	Semantic Scholar
The usefulness of the RFT based model was discussed along with the experimental results.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, drop tests were conducted using a four-legged lander to comprehensively analyze its landing behaviors.	Semantic Scholar
From the footpad drop tests and numerical analysis based on the RFT, we confirmed the following: 1) the force acting on the footpad is enhanced, and the penetration depth is reduced in a vacuum, 2) the force and kinetic energy conversion rate are smallest for the curved footpad, and 3) an increase in the ground density had a relatively small impact on the penetration depth of the footpads in a vacuum.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the drop tests using the lander model confirmed that even if some of the lander's footpads land on regolith simulant with different densities, this does not lead to postural imbalance or turnover of the lander in a vacuum.	Semantic Scholar
This paper addresses the problem of reconstructing the surface shape of transparent objects.	Semantic Scholar
The difficulty of this problem originates from the viewpoint dependent appearance of a transparent object, which quickly makes reconstruction methods tailored for diffuse surfaces fail disgracefully.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we introduce a fixed viewpoint approach to dense surface reconstruction of transparent objects based on refraction of light.	Semantic Scholar
We present a simple setup that allows us to alter the incident light paths before light rays enter the object by immersing the object partially in a liquid, and develop a method for recovering the object surface through reconstructing and triangulating such incident light paths.	Semantic Scholar
Our proposed approach does not need to model the complex interactions of light as it travels through the object, neither does it assume any parametric form for the object shape nor the exact number of refractions and reflections taken place along the light paths.	Semantic Scholar
It can therefore handle transparent objects with a relatively complex shape and structure, with unknown and inhomogeneous refractive index.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that for thin transparent objects, our proposed acquisition setup can be further simplified by adopting a single refraction approximation.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our proposed approach.	Semantic Scholar

Super-coiled polymer (SCP) artificial muscles have many attractive properties, such as high energy density, large contractions, and good dynamic range.	Semantic Scholar
To fully utilize them for robotic applications, it is necessary to determine how to scale them up effectively.	Semantic Scholar
Bundling of SCP actuators, as though they are individual threads in woven textiles, can demonstrate the versatility of SCP actuators and artificial muscles in general.	Semantic Scholar
However, this versatility comes with a need to understand how different bundling techniques can be achieved with these actuators and how they may trade off in performance.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents the first quantitative comparison, analysis, and modeling of bundled SCP actuators.	Semantic Scholar
By exploiting weaving and braiding techniques, three new types of bundled SCP actuators are created: woven bundles, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional braided bundles.	Semantic Scholar
The bundle performance is adjustable by employing different numbers of individual actuators.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments are conducted to characterize and compare the force, strain, and speed of different bundles, and a linear model is proposed to predict their performance.	Semantic Scholar
This work lays the foundation for model-based SCP-actuated textiles, and physically scaling robots that employ SCP actuators as the driving mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
Self-driving cars have, in recent years, clearly become among the most actively discussed and researched topics.	Semantic Scholar
By all definitions, these systems, as a third robotic revolution, belong to the robotics field, despite the fact that people generally assign them to a specific domain of the automotive industry [1].	Semantic Scholar
Replicating the complex task of human driving by an autonomous system poses countless engineering challenges, involving the wider field of robotics, including environment perception, decision making, and control.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents the development of a mesoscale fiberoptic rotation sensor with a diameter of 8 mm for a shape memory alloy (SMA) torsion actuator for neurosurgical applications.	Semantic Scholar
Within the sensor, a rotary head with a reflecting surface is capable of modulating the light intensity collected by optical fibers when the rotary head is coupled to the torsion actuator.	Semantic Scholar
The mechanism of light intensity modulation is modeled, followed by experimental model verification.	Semantic Scholar
Meanwhile, working performances for different rotary head designs, optical fibers, and fabrication materials are compared.	Semantic Scholar
After the calibration of the fiberoptic rotation sensor, the sensor is capable of precisely measuring rotary motion and controlling the SMA torsion actuator with feedback control.	Semantic Scholar
Wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches, allow for continuous recording of everyday life in a real world over an extended period of time or lifelong.	Semantic Scholar
This possibility helps better understand the cognitive behavior of humans in real life as well as build human-aware intelligent agents for practical purposes.	Semantic Scholar
However, modeling the human cognitive activity from wearable-sensor data stream is challenging because learning new information often results in loss of previously acquired information, causing a problem known as catastrophic forgetting.	Semantic Scholar
Here we propose a deep-learning neural network architecture that resolves the catastrophic forgetting problem.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the neurocognitive theory of the complementary learning systems of the neocortex and hippocampus, we introduce a dual memory architecture (DMA) that, on one hand, slowly acquires the structured knowledge representations and, on the other hand, rapidly learns the specifics of individual experiences.	Semantic Scholar
The DMA system learns continuously through incremental feature adaptation and weight transfer.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate the performance on two real-life datasets, the CIFAR-10 image-stream dataset and the 46-day Lifelog dataset collected from Google Glass, showing that the proposed model outperforms other online learning methods.	Semantic Scholar

In this letter, we present a grasp planner that integrates two sources of information to generate robust grasps for a robotic hand.	Semantic Scholar
First, the topological information of the object model is incorporated by building the mean curvature skeleton and segmenting the object accordingly in order to identify object regions which are suitable for grasping.	Semantic Scholar
We show how this information can be used to derive different grasping strategies, which also allows to distinguish between precision and power grasps.	Semantic Scholar
Second, the local surface structure is investigated to construct feasible and robust grasping poses by aligning the hand according to the local object shape.	Semantic Scholar
We apply the approach to a wide variety of object models of the KIT and the YCB real-world object model databases and evaluate it with several robotic hands.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that the skeleton-based grasp planner is capable to generate high-quality grasps in an efficient manner.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we evaluate how robust the planned grasps are against hand positioning errors as they occur in real-world applications due to perception and actuation inaccuracies.	Semantic Scholar
The evaluation shows that the majority of the generated grasps are of high quality since they can be successfully applied even when the hand is not exactly positioned.	Semantic Scholar
A key problem in robotics is enabling an autonomous agent to perform human-like arm movements in close proximity to another human.	Semantic Scholar
However, modeling the human decision and control process of the movement during dyadic interaction presents a challenge.	Semantic Scholar
Although, most prior approaches rely on multicomponent robot motion planning architectures, we use data of two humans performing interfering arm reaching movements to extract and transfer interaction behavior control skill to a robotic agent.	Semantic Scholar
A recurrent neural network-based framework is constructed to learn a policy that computes control signals for a robot end effector in order to replace one human.	Semantic Scholar
The learned policy is benchmarked against unseen interaction data and a state-of-the-art learning from demonstration framework in simulated scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
We compare several architectures and investigate a new activation function of three stacked tanh().	Semantic Scholar
The results show that the proposed framework successfully learns a policy to imitate human movement behavior control during dyadic interaction.	Semantic Scholar
The policy is transferred to a real robot and its feasibility for close-proximity human-robot interaction is shown.	Semantic Scholar
Teleoperation in extreme environments can be hindered by limitations in telemetry and in operator perception of the remote environment.	Semantic Scholar
Often, the primary mode of perception is visual feedback from remote cameras, which do not always provide suitable views and are subject to telemetry delays.	Semantic Scholar
To address these challenges, we propose to build a model of the remote environment and provide an augmented virtuality visualization system that augments the model with projections of real camera images.	Semantic Scholar
The approach is demonstrated in a satellite servicing scenario, with a multisecond round-trip telemetry delay between the operator on Earth and the satellite on orbit.	Semantic Scholar
The scene modeling enables both virtual fixtures to assist the human operator and augmented virtuality visualization that allows the operator to teleoperate a virtual robot from a convenient virtual viewpoint, with the delayed camera images projected onto the three-dimensional model.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on a ground-based telerobotic platform, with software-created telemetry delays, indicate that the proposed method leads to better teleoperation performance with 30% better blade alignment and 50% reduction in task execution time compared to the baseline case where visualization is restricted to the available camera views.	Semantic Scholar
In program analysis, the synthesis of models of logical theories representing the program semantics is often useful to prove program properties.	Semantic Scholar
We use order-sorted first-order logic as an appropriate framework to describe the semantics and properties of programs as given theories.	Semantic Scholar
Then we investigate the automatic synthesis of models for such theories.	Semantic Scholar
We use convex polytopic domains as a flexible approach to associate different domains to different sorts.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce a framework for the piecewise definition of functions and predicates.	Semantic Scholar
We develop its use with linear expressions (in a wide sense, including linear transformations represented as matrices) and inequalities to specify functions and predicates.	Semantic Scholar
In this way, algorithms and tools from linear algebra and arithmetic constraint solving (e.g., SMT) can be used as a backend for an efficient implementation.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a novel semantic mapping approach, Recurrent-OctoMap, learned from long-term three-dimensional (3-D) Lidar data.	Semantic Scholar
Most existing semantic mapping approaches focus on improving semantic understanding of single frames, rather than 3-D refinement of semantic maps (i.e.	Semantic Scholar
fusing semantic observations).	Semantic Scholar
The most widely used approach for the 3-D semantic map refinement is “Bayes update,” which fuses the consecutive predictive probabilities following a Markov-chain model.	Semantic Scholar
Instead, we propose a learning approach to fuse the semantic features, rather than simply fusing predictions from a classifier.	Semantic Scholar
In our approach, we represent and maintain our 3-D map as an OctoMap, and model each cell as a recurrent neural network, to obtain a Recurrent-OctoMap.	Semantic Scholar
In this case, the semantic mapping process can be formulated as a sequence-to-sequence encoding–decoding problem.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, in order to extend the duration of observations in our Recurrent-OctoMap, we developed a robust 3-D localization and mapping system for successively mapping a dynamic environment using more than two weeks of data, and the system can be trained and deployed with arbitrary memory length.	Semantic Scholar
We validate our approach on the ETH long-term 3-D Lidar dataset.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms the conventional “Bayes update” approach.	Semantic Scholar
Advances in real-time location systems have enabled us to collect massive amounts of fine-grained semantically rich location traces, which provide unparalleled opportunities for understanding human activities and generating useful knowledge.	Semantic Scholar
This, in turn, delivers intelligence for real-time decision making in various fields, such as workflow management.	Semantic Scholar
Indeed, it is a new paradigm to model workflows through knowledge discovery in location traces.	Semantic Scholar
To that end, in this paper, we provide a focused study of workflow modeling by integrated analysis of indoor location traces in the hospital environment.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we develop a workflow modeling framework that automatically constructs the workflow states and estimates the parameters describing the workflow transition patterns.	Semantic Scholar
More specifically, we propose effective and efficient regularizations for modeling the indoor location traces as stochastic processes.	Semantic Scholar
First, to improve the interpretability of the workflow states, we use the geography relationship between the indoor rooms to define a prior of the workflow state distribution.	Semantic Scholar
This prior encourages each workflow state to be a contiguous region in the building.	Semantic Scholar
Second, to further improve the modeling performance, we show how to use the correlation between related types of medical devices to reinforce the parameter estimation for multiple workflow models.	Semantic Scholar
In comparison with our preliminary work [11] , we not only develop an integrated workflow modeling framework applicable to general indoor environments, but also improve the modeling accuracy significantly.	Semantic Scholar
We reduce the average log-loss by up to 11 percent.	Semantic Scholar

"State-of-the-art systems that place recognition in a group of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$n$ </tex-math></inline-formula> robots either rely on a centralized solution, where each robot's map is sent to a central server, or a decentralized solution, where the map is either sent to all other robots, or robots within a communication range."

"Both approaches have their drawbacks: centralized systems rely on a central entity, which handles all the computational load and cannot be deployed in large, remote areas, whereas decentralized systems either exchange <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$n$</tex-math></inline-formula> times more data or preclude matches between robots that visit the same place at different times while never being close enough to communicate directly."

The core idea is that the candidate selection in visual bag-of-words can be distributed by preassigning words of the vocabulary to different robots.	Semantic Scholar
The result of this candidate selection is then used to choose a single robot to which the full query is sent.	Semantic Scholar

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use a distributed inverted index in multirobot place recognition.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a novel approach for recognition of walking activities and gait events with wearable sensors is presented.	Semantic Scholar
This approach, called adaptive Bayesian inference system (BasIS), uses a probabilistic formulation with a sequential analysis method, for recognition of walking activities performed by participants.	Semantic Scholar
Recognition of gait events, needed to identify the state of the human body during the walking activity, is also provided by the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the BasIS system includes an adaptive action-perception method for the prediction of gait events.	Semantic Scholar
The adaptive approach uses the knowledge gained from decisions made over time by the inference system.	Semantic Scholar
The action-perception method allows the BasIS system to autonomously adapt its performance, based on the evaluation of its own predictions and decisions made over time.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach is implemented in a layered architecture and validated with the recognition of three walking activities:level-ground, ramp ascent and ramp descent.	Semantic Scholar
The validation process employs real data from three inertial measurements units attached to the thigh, shanks and foot of participants while performing walking activities.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments show that mean decision times of 240 ms and 40 ms are needed to achieve mean accuracies of 99.87% and 99.82% for recognition of walking activities and gait events, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
The validation experiments also show that the performance, in accuracy and speed, is not significantly affected when noise is added to sensor measurements.	Semantic Scholar
These results show that the proposed adaptive recognition system is accurate, fast and robust to sensor noise, but also capable to adapt its own performance over time.	Semantic Scholar
Overall, the adaptive BasIS system demonstrates to be a robust and suitable computational approach for the intelligent recognition of activities of daily living using wearable sensors.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents an end-to-end approach to automate the design and fabrication process for self-folding origami structures.	Semantic Scholar
Self-folding origami structures are robotic sheets composed of rigid tiles and joint actuators.	Semantic Scholar
When they are exposed to heat, each joint folds into a preprogrammed angle.	Semantic Scholar
Those folding motions transform themselves into a structure, which can be used as body of 3-D origami robots, including walkers, analog circuits, rotational actuators, and microcell grippers.	Semantic Scholar
Given a 3-D model, the design algorithm automatically generates a layout printing design of the sheet form of the structure.	Semantic Scholar
The geometric information, such as the fold angles and the folding sequences, is embedded in the sheet design.	Semantic Scholar

Multi-robot conflict resolution is a challenging problem, especially in dense environments where many robots must operate safely in a confined space.	Semantic Scholar
Centralized solutions do not scale well with the number of robots in dynamic scenarios: a centralized communication can cause bottlenecks and may not be robust enough when channels are unreliable; the complexity of algorithms grows with the number of robots, making online re-computation too expensive in many situations.

In this work, we propose a decentralized approach for conflict resolution where robots show reactive and safe behaviors, avoiding collisions with both static and dynamic objects, even under unreliable communication conditions and with low resources.	Semantic Scholar
They detect conflicts with neighboring obstacles locally and then apply rules to surround them in a roundabout fashion, assuming that others will follow the same policy.	Semantic Scholar
The method is designed for unicycle robots with range-finder sensors, and it is able to cope with noisy sensors and secondorder dynamic constraints, ensuring always collision-free navigation.	Semantic Scholar
Besides, a set of metrics and scenarios for benchmarking in multi-robot collision avoidance are proposed.	Semantic Scholar
We also compare our method with others from the state of the art through extensive simulations.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments with real robots are also presented in order to show the feasibility of the system.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we address the problem of teleoperating a multirobot system, and we propose a methodology for letting the user teleoperate the group of robots according to some desired dynamic behavior.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we propose a novel methodology for the teleoperation of multirobot systems, where a local control action and interrobot relationships are tuned in order to reduce their effect on the force feedback perceived by the operator.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed methodology is developed guaranteeing preservation of the passivity property.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness of the proposed teleoperation scheme is validated experimentally, on real robots and in a virtual reality environment.	Semantic Scholar
Nowadays huge volumes of data are produced in the form of fast streams, which are further affected by non-stationary phenomena.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting lack of stationarity in the distribution of the produced data calls for efficient and scalable algorithms for online analysis capable of adapting to such changes (concept drift).	Semantic Scholar
The online learning field has lately turned its focus on this challenging scenario, by designing incremental learning algorithms that avoid becoming obsolete after a concept drift occurs.	Semantic Scholar
Despite the noted activity in the literature, a need for new efficient and scalable algorithms that adapt to the drift still prevails as a research topic deserving further effort.	Semantic Scholar
Surprisingly, Spiking Neural Networks, one of the major exponents of the third generation of artificial neural networks, have not been thoroughly studied as an online learning approach, even though they are naturally suited to easily and quickly adapting to changing environments.	Semantic Scholar
This work covers this research gap by adapting Spiking Neural Networks to meet the processing requirements that online learning scenarios impose.	Semantic Scholar
In particular the work focuses on limiting the size of the neuron repository and making the most of this limited size by resorting to data reduction techniques.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments with synthetic and real data sets are discussed, leading to the empirically validated assertion that, by virtue of a tailored exploitation of the neuron repository, Spiking Neural Networks adapt better to drifts, obtaining higher accuracy scores than naive versions of Spiking Neural Networks for online learning environments.	Semantic Scholar
This work lays the foundation for a framework of cortical learning based on the idea of a competitive column, which is inspired by the functional organization of neurons in the cortex.	Semantic Scholar
A column describes a prototypical organization for neurons that gives rise to an ability to learn scale, rotation, and translation-invariant features.	Semantic Scholar
This is empowered by a recently developed learning rule, conflict learning, which enables the network to learn over both driving and modulatory feedforward, feedback, and lateral inputs.	Semantic Scholar
The framework is further supported by introducing both a notion of neural ambiguity and an adaptive threshold scheme.	Semantic Scholar
Ambiguity, which captures the idea that too many decisions lead to indecision, gives the network a dynamic way to resolve locally ambiguous decisions.	Semantic Scholar
The adaptive threshold operates over multiple timescales to regulate neural activity under the varied arrival timings of input in a highly interconnected multilayer network with feedforward and feedback.	Semantic Scholar
The competitive column architecture is demonstrated on a large-scale (54,000 neurons and 18 million synapses), invariant model of border ownership.	Semantic Scholar
The model is trained on four simple, fixed-scale shapes: two squares, one rectangle, and one symmetric L-shape.	Semantic Scholar
Tested on 1899 synthetic shapes of varying scale and complexity, the model correctly assigned border ownership with 74% accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
The model's abilities were also illustrated on contours of objects taken from natural images.	Semantic Scholar
Combined with conflict learning, the competitive column and ambiguity give a better intuitive understanding of how feedback, modulation, and inhibition may interact in the brain to influence activation and learning.	Semantic Scholar
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied to visual tasks since the late 1980s.	Semantic Scholar
However, despite a few scattered applications, they were dormant until the mid-2000s when developments in computing power and the advent of large amounts of labeled data, supplemented by improved algorithms, contributed to their advancement and brought them to the forefront of a neural network renaissance that has seen rapid progression since 2012.	Semantic Scholar
In this review, which focuses on the application of CNNs to image classification tasks, we cover their development, from their predecessors up to recent state-of-the-art deep learning systems.	Semantic Scholar
Along the way, we analyze (1) their early successes, (2) their role in the deep learning renaissance, (3) selected symbolic works that have contributed to their recent popularity, and (4) several improvement attempts by reviewing contributions and challenges of over 300 publications.	Semantic Scholar
We also introduce some of their current trends and remaining challenges.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a neural network model for reinforcement learning to control a robotic manipulator with unknown parameters and dead zones.	Semantic Scholar
The model is composed of three networks.	Semantic Scholar
The state of the robotic manipulator is predicted by the state network of the model, the action policy is learned by the action network, and the performance index of the action policy is estimated by a critic network.	Semantic Scholar
The three networks work together to optimize the performance index based on the reinforcement learning control scheme.	Semantic Scholar
The convergence of the learning methods is analyzed.	Semantic Scholar
Application of the proposed model on a simulated two-link robotic manipulator demonstrates the effectiveness and the stability of the model.	Semantic Scholar
Developing advanced robotics applications is now facing the safety issue for users, the environment, and the robot itself, which is a main limitation for their deployment in real life.	Semantic Scholar
This safety could be justified by the use of dependability techniques as it is done in other safety-critical applications.	Semantic Scholar
However, due to specific robotic properties (such as continuous human–robot physical interaction or non deterministic decisional layer), many techniques need to be adapted or revised.	Semantic Scholar
This paper reviews the main issues, research work and challenges in the field of safety-critical robots, linking up dependability and robotics concepts.	Semantic Scholar

Although representation learning methods developed within the framework of traditional neural networks are relatively mature, developing a spiking representation model remains a challenging problem.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes an event-based method to train a feedforward spiking neural network (SNN) layer for extracting visual features.	Semantic Scholar
The method introduces a novel spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule and a threshold adjustment rule both derived from a vector quantization-like objective function subject to a sparsity constraint.	Semantic Scholar
The STDP rule is obtained by the gradient of a vector quantization criterion that is converted to spike-based, spatio-temporally local update rules in a spiking network of leaky, integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons.	Semantic Scholar
Independence and sparsity of the model are achieved by the threshold adjustment rule and by a softmax function implementing inhibition in the representation layer consisting of WTA-thresholded spiking neurons.	Semantic Scholar
Together, these mechanisms implement a form of spike-based, competitive learning.	Semantic Scholar
Two sets of experiments are performed on the MNIST and natural image datasets.	Semantic Scholar
The results demonstrate a sparse spiking visual representation model with low reconstruction loss comparable with state-of-the-art visual coding approaches, yet our rule is local in both time and space, thus biologically plausible and hardware friendly.	Semantic Scholar

Fractional order system is playing an increasingly important role in terms of both theory and applications.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we investigate the global existence of Filippov solutions and the robust generalized Mittag-Leffler synchronization of fractional order neural networks with discontinuous activation and impulses.	Semantic Scholar
By means of growth conditions, differential inclusions and generalized Gronwall inequality, a sufficient condition for the existence of Filippov solution is obtained.	Semantic Scholar
Then, sufficient criteria are given for the robust generalized Mittag-Leffler synchronization between discontinuous activation function of impulsive fractional order neural network systems with (or without) parameter uncertainties, via a delayed feedback controller and M-Matrix theory.

This study presents a resolved viscoelasticity control (RVC) method to handle multiple viscoelasticity in a humanoid system.	Semantic Scholar
A previous study proposed an RVC by explicitly considering structure-variability and demonstrated biped walking motions on an uneven terrain and a slope.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, the RVC is extended to multiple viscoelasticity, namely viscoelasticity on multiple feature points and multiple values in single viscoelasticity.	Semantic Scholar
The resolved multiple viscoelasticity control can improve both tracking performance and stability.	Semantic Scholar
The results indicate that resolving center of gravity (COG) and swing foot viscoelasticity improves the walking performance and that switching multiple values of the COG viscoelasticity improves the balancing performance.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method is validated by using forward dynamics simulations.	Semantic Scholar

A novel soft-robotic gripper design is presented, with three soft bending fingers and one passively adaptive palm.	Semantic Scholar
Each soft finger comprises two ellipse-profiled pneumatic chambers.	Semantic Scholar
Combined with the adaptive palm and the surface patterned feature, the soft gripper could achieve 40-N grasping force in practice, 10 times the self-weight, at a very low actuation pressure below 100 kPa.	Semantic Scholar
With novel soft finger design, the gripper could pick up small objects, as well as conform to large convex-shape objects with reliable contact.	Semantic Scholar
The fabrication process was presented in detail, involving commercial-grade three-dimensional printing and molding of silicone rubber.	Semantic Scholar
The fabricated actuators and gripper were tested on a dedicated platform, showing the gripper could reliably grasp objects of various shapes and sizes, even with external disturbances.	Semantic Scholar
The central concept of this letter is to develop an assistive manipulator that can automate the bathing task for elderly citizens.	Semantic Scholar
We propose to exploit principles of soft robotic technologies to design and control a compliant system to ensure safe human–robot interaction, a primary requirement for the task.	Semantic Scholar
The overall system is intended to be modular with a proximal segment that provides structural integrity to overcome gravitational challenges and a distal segment to perform the main bathing activities.	Semantic Scholar
The focus of this letter is on the design and control of the latter module.	Semantic Scholar
The design comprises of alternating tendons and pneumatics in a radial arrangement, which enables elongation, contraction, and omnidirectional bending.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, a synergetic coactivation of cables and tendons in a given configuration allows for stiffness modulation, which is necessary to facilitate washing and scrubbing.	Semantic Scholar
The novelty of the work is twofold: 1) Three base cases of antagonistic actuation are identified that enable stiffness variation.	Semantic Scholar
Each category is then experimentally characterized by the application of an external force that imposes a linear displacement at the tip in both axial and lateral directions.	Semantic Scholar
2) The development of a novel algorithm based on cooperative multiagent reinforcement learning that simultaneously optimizes stiffness and position.	Semantic Scholar
The results highlight the effectiveness of the design and control to contribute toward the development of the assistive device.	Semantic Scholar

As a common issue of battery systems, the charge imbalance among battery cells/modules/packs may cause reduced charge capacity, low energy efficiency, accelerated degradation, and even fire hazard.	Semantic Scholar
To battle this issue, various circuit designs and control strategies have been developed in past decades.	Semantic Scholar
In these research and development efforts, the equalization time, which is defined as the time needed for the battery system to reach charge equalization, is often regarded as one of the most important performance measures.	Semantic Scholar
While great efforts have been made to shorten the charge equalization time through the designs of balance circuits and control strategies, limited attention is given to the battery cell reconfiguration.	Semantic Scholar
Indeed, numerical experiments show that the equalization time can be significantly affected by the connection pattern of battery cells.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we study such effects in battery systems with series-based charge equalization structure, and develop the cell reconfiguration algorithm to quickly identify a cell connection configuration with near-minimum charge equalization time.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical simulation shows that the proposed algorithm can significantly expedite the charge equalization process.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a novel approach for fusing information from multiple access points in order to enhance WiFi-based self-localization.	Semantic Scholar
A common approach for designing WiFi-based localization systems is to learn location-to-signal strength mappings for each access point in an environment.	Semantic Scholar
Each mapping is then used to compute the likelihood of the robot's location conditioned on sensed signal strength data, yielding as many likelihood functions as mappings are available.	Semantic Scholar
Office buildings typically have from several tens to a few hundreds of access points, making it essential to properly combine all available likelihoods into a single, coherent, joint likelihood that yields precise likelihoods, yet is not overconfident.	Semantic Scholar
While most research has focused on techniques for learning these mappings and improving data acquisition; research on techniques to adequately fuse them has been neglected.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach for data information fusion is based on information theory and yields considerably better joint distributions than previous approaches.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, through extensive testing, we show that these joint likelihoods considerably increase the system's localization performance.	Semantic Scholar
Many of the words in a given document either deliver facts (<italic>objective</italic>) or express opinions (<italic> subjective</italic>), respectively, depending on the topics they are involved in.	Semantic Scholar
For example, given a bunch of documents, the word “bug” assigned to the topic “<italic>order Hemiptera</italic>” apparently remarks one object (i.e., one kind of insects), while the same word assigned to the topic “<italic>software </italic>” probably conveys a negative opinion.	Semantic Scholar
Motivated by the intuitive assumption that different words have varying degrees of <italic>discriminative</italic> power in delivering the objective sense or the subjective sense with respect to their assigned topics, a model named as <italic>d</italic>iscriminatively <italic>o</italic>bjective- <italic>s</italic>ubjective LDA (dosLDA) is proposed in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
The essential idea underlying the proposed dosLDA is that a pair of objective and subjective selection variables are explicitly employed to encode the interplay between topics and discriminative power for the words in documents in a supervised manner.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, each document is appropriately represented as “<italic>bag-of-discriminative-words</italic>” (BoDW).	Semantic Scholar
The experiments reported on documents and images demonstrate that dosLDA not only performs competitively over traditional approaches in terms of topic modeling and document classification, but also has the ability to discern the discriminative power of each word in terms of its objective or subjective sense with respect to its assigned topic.

Impedance shaping is a fundamental requirement for physical human–robot interaction.	Semantic Scholar
In order to achieve a large range impedance capability, light quantity measurement based torque feedback regulation has been introduced, based on which a stiff actuator design can be realized with reliable torque measurements, thus leading to high performance of torque regulation and large range of impedance shaping.

Physical human–robot interaction experiments’ results also demonstrate its great advantage over motor current and strain gauge based control.	Semantic Scholar
Designing an exoskeleton to reduce the risk of low-back injury during lifting is challenging.	Semantic Scholar
Computational models of the human–robot system coupled with predictive movement simulations can help to simplify this design process.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we present a study that models the interaction between a human model actuated by muscles and a lower back exoskeleton.	Semantic Scholar
We provide a computational framework for identifying the spring parameters of the exoskeleton using an optimal control approach and forward-dynamics simulations.	Semantic Scholar
This is applied to generate dynamically consistent bending and lifting movements in the sagittal plane.	Semantic Scholar
Our computations are able to predict motions and forces of the human and exoskeleton that are within the torque limits of a subject.	Semantic Scholar
The identified exoskeleton could also yield a considerable reduction of the peak lower back torques as well as the cumulative lower back load during the movements.	Semantic Scholar
This letter is relevant to the research communities working on human–robot interaction, and can be used as a basis for a better human-centered design process.	Semantic Scholar
Minimax similarity stresses the connectedness of points via mediating elements rather than favoring high mutual similarity.	Semantic Scholar
The grouping principle yields superior clustering results when mining arbitrarily-shaped clusters in data.	Semantic Scholar
However, it is not robust against noises and outliers in the data.	Semantic Scholar
There are two main problems with the grouping principle: first, a single object that is far away from all other objects defines a separate cluster, and second, two connected clusters would be regarded as two parts of one cluster.	Semantic Scholar
In order to solve such problems, we propose robust minimum spanning tree (MST)-based clustering algorithm in this letter.	Semantic Scholar
First, we separate the connected objects by applying a density-based coarsening phase, resulting in a low-rank matrix in which the element denotes the supernode by combining a set of nodes.	Semantic Scholar
Then a greedy method is presented to partition those supernodes through working on the low-rank matrix.	Semantic Scholar
Instead of removing the longest edges from MST, our algorithm groups the data set based on the minimax similarity.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the assignment of all data points can be achieved through their corresponding supernodes.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on many synthetic and real-world data sets show that our algorithm consistently outperforms compared clustering algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Robotic manipulation of such highly deformable objects as clothes is a challenging problem.	Semantic Scholar
Robot-assisted dressing adds even more complexity as the garment motions must be aligned with a human body under conditions of strong and variable occlusion.	Semantic Scholar
As a step toward solutions for the general task, we consider the example of a dual-arm robot with attached anthropomorphic hands that learns to put a knit cap on a styrofoam head.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach avoids modeling the details of the garment and its deformations.	Semantic Scholar
Instead, we demonstrate that a head-centric policy parameterization, combined with a suitable objective function for determining the right amount of contact between the cap and the head, enables a direct policy search algorithm to find successful trajectories for this task.	Semantic Scholar
We also show how a toy problem that mirrors some of the task constraints can be used to efficiently structure hyperparameter search.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, we suggest a point cloud based algorithm for modeling the head as an ellipsoid which is required for defining the policy space.	Semantic Scholar
Previous work on assigning tasks to robots has proposed extensive categorizations of allocation of tasks with and without constraints.	Semantic Scholar
The main contribution of this paper is a more specific categorization of problems that have both temporal and ordering constraints.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel taxonomy that builds on the existing taxonomy for multi-robot task allocation and organizes the current literature according to the temporal nature of the tasks.	Semantic Scholar
We summarize widely used models and methods from the task allocation literature and related areas, such as vehicle routing and scheduling problems, showing similarities and differences.	Semantic Scholar
The efficient processing of document streams plays an important role in many information filtering systems.	Semantic Scholar
Emerging applications, such as news update filtering and social network notifications, demand presenting end-users with the most relevant content to their preferences.	Semantic Scholar

Archiving graph data over history is demanded in many applications, such as social network studies, collaborative projects, scientific graph databases, and bibliographies.	Semantic Scholar
Typically people are interested in querying temporal graphs.	Semantic Scholar
Existing keyword search approaches for graph-structured data are insufficient for querying temporal graphs.	Semantic Scholar
This paper initiates the study of supporting keyword-based queries on temporal graphs.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a search syntax that is a moderate extension of keyword search, which allows casual users to easily search temporal graphs with optional predicates and ranking functions related to timestamps.	Semantic Scholar
To generate results efficiently, we first propose a best path iterator, which finds the paths between two data nodes in each snapshot that is the “best” with respect to three ranking factors.	Semantic Scholar
It prunes invalid or inferior paths and maximizes shared processing among different snapshots.	Semantic Scholar

Parallel continuum robots (PCRs) combine the compactness, simplicity, and compliance of continuum robots with the precision and strength of rigid-link parallel robots.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we provide a generalized Cosserat-rod-based kinetostatic model framework that accommodates various joint types and problem formulations (e.g., forward and inverse kinematics under loads, and deflection-based and actuation-based force sensing) useful for simulation and control.	Semantic Scholar
Linearization of this general model provides the manipulator Jacobian, end-effector compliance, input stiffness, and wrench reflectivity matrices, which allow us to examine the effect of design parameters on dexterity, force application, and force-sensing ability.	Semantic Scholar
Using ellipsoids based on the matrices, we provide a set of design simulations and graphically depict the relationships between pose, actuation, and forces.	Semantic Scholar
We further provide a nondimensional analysis of the compliance of PCRs.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we experimentally demonstrate and validate actuation-based force sensing on a prototype six-degree-of-freedom PCR, demonstrating 3-D force sensing with a median magnitude and a directional error of 0.23 N (8% of actual load) and 12$^{\circ}$ , respectively.	Semantic Scholar
This paper studies the satisfiability problem of poly-power constraints (conjunctions of poly-power equations and inequalities), in which poly-powers are univariate nonlinear functions that extend integer exponents of polynomials to real algebraic exponents.	Semantic Scholar
To solve the poly-power constraint, we present a sound and complete procedure that incorporates conflict-driven learning with the exclusion algorithm for isolating positive roots of poly-powers.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we introduce a kind of optimal interval-splitting, based on the Stern–Brocot tree and on binary rational numbers respectively, so that the operands occurring in the execution are chosen to be as simple as possible.	Semantic Scholar
The solving procedure, thereby, turns out to be promisingly efficient on randomly generated examples.	Semantic Scholar
In making practical decisions, agents are expected to comply with ideals of behaviour, or norms.	Semantic Scholar
In reality, it may not be possible for an individual, or a team of agents, to be fully compliant—actual behaviour often differs from the ideal.	Semantic Scholar
The question we address in this paper is how we can design agents that act in such a way that they select collective strategies to avoid more critical failures (norm violations), and mitigate the effects of violations that do occur.	Semantic Scholar
We model the normative requirements of a system through contrary-to-duty obligations and violation severity levels, and propose a novel multi-agent planning mechanism based on Decentralised POMDPs that uses a qualitative reward function to capture levels of compliance: N-Dec-POMDPs.	Semantic Scholar
We develop mechanisms for solving this type of multi-agent planning problem and show, through empirical analysis, that joint policies generated are equally as good as those produced through existing methods but with significant reductions in execution time.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we build on recent advances in deep learning to improve SE(3) transformations, enabling more accurate motion estimation in mobile robots.	Semantic Scholar
We propose using denoising autoencoders (DAEs) to address the challenges presented by modern LIDARs.	Semantic Scholar
Our proposed approach is comprised of two stages: a novel pre-processing stage for robust feature identification and a scan matching stage for motion estimation.	Semantic Scholar
In the pre-processing stage, LIDAR data are projected into a two-dimensional (2-D) image format and a DAE is used to extract salient features.	Semantic Scholar
These features are used as a mask for the original data, which is then re-projected into full 3-D space.	Semantic Scholar
Scan matching is performed on the re-projected data to estimate motion in SE(3).	Semantic Scholar
We analyze the performance of our approach using the real-world data from the University of Michigan North Campus long-term vision and LIDAR dataset and test generalization on LIDAR data from the KITTI dataset.	Semantic Scholar
We show that our approach generalizes across domains, is capable of reducing the per-estimate error of standard iterative closest point (ICP) methods on average by 25.5% for the translational component and 57.53% for the rotational component, and is capable of reducing the computation time of state-of-the-art ICP methods by a factor of 7.94 on average while achieving competitive performance.

Shared control is a strategy used in assistive platforms to combine human and robot orders to achieve a goal.	Semantic Scholar
Collaborative control is a specific shared control approach, in which user's and robot's commands are merged into an emergent one in a continuous way.	Semantic Scholar
Robot commands tend to improve efficiency and safety.	Semantic Scholar
However, sometimes, assistance can be rejected by users when their commands are too altered.	Semantic Scholar
This provokes frustration and stress and, usually, decreases emergent efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
To improve acceptance, robot navigation algorithms can be adapted to mimic human behavior when possible.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel variation of the well-known dynamic window approach (DWA) that we call biomimetical DWA (BDWA).	Semantic Scholar
The BDWA relies on a reward function extracted from real traces from volunteers presenting different motor disabilities navigating in a hospital environment using a rollator for support.	Semantic Scholar
We have compared the BDWA with other reactive algorithms in terms of similarity to paths completed by people with disabilities using a robotic rollator in a rehabilitation hospital unit.	Semantic Scholar
The BDWA outperforms all tested algorithms in terms of likeness to human paths and success rate.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a practical state-of-the-art method to develop a machine-learning-based humanoid robot that can work as a production line worker.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach provides an intuitive way to collect data and exhibits the following characteristics: task performing capability, task reiteration ability, generalizability, and easy applicability.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach utilizes a real-time user interface with a monitor and provides a first-person perspective using a head-mounted display.	Semantic Scholar
Through this interface, teleoperation is used for collecting task operating data, especially for tasks that are difficult to be applied with a conventional method.	Semantic Scholar

The task of identifying the semantic localization of a robot has commonly been treated as a classification problem, where images are taken as input and a set of predefined labels is the output.	Semantic Scholar
While traditional approaches have focused on the performance of the image features extracted from computer vision techniques, the contextual information that can come with the images has not been taken into account.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we present an approach for integrating this information in a scene classification pipeline where we opt for Bayesian network classifiers in addition to standard support vector machine ones.	Semantic Scholar
The approach is evaluated in two scenarios, one in which the contextual information is directly provided with the images, and the other where it must be inferred in an additional stage.	Semantic Scholar
The evaluation has been performed using two families of classifiers over two datasets, and the results obtained show how the scene classification problem can benefit from the integration of contextual information.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we address the modeling and learning of complex nonlinear rigid-body motions employing Gaussian processes.	Semantic Scholar
As the common procedure of using Euler angles in the Gaussian process results in inaccurate predictions for large rotations, we represent the input data by axis-angle pseudovectors for rotations and Euclidean vectors for translation.	Semantic Scholar
"Our decision in favor of this representation of the special Euclidean group <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$SE(3)$</tex-math></inline-formula> is due to its computational efficiency."	Semantic Scholar

We prove that those functions fulfill the requirements of Gaussian processes.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach is validated on simulated and on real human motion data.	Semantic Scholar
Our results demonstrate significant benefits of the proposed rigid-body Gaussian process with respect to alternative variants in terms of regression performance and computational efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
It is well known that visual-inertial state estimation is possible up to a four degrees-of-freedom (DoF) transformation (rotation around gravity and translation), and the extra DoFs (“gauge freedom”) have to be handled properly.	Semantic Scholar
While different approaches for handling the gauge freedom have been used in practice, no previous study has been carried out to systematically analyze their differences.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present the first comparative analysis of different methods for handling the gauge freedom in optimization-based visual-inertial state estimation.	Semantic Scholar
We experimentally compare three commonly used approaches: fixing the unobservable states to some given values, setting a prior on such states, or letting the states evolve freely during optimization.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we show that 1) the accuracy and computational time of the three methods are similar, with the free gauge approach being slightly faster; 2) the covariance estimation from the free gauge approach appears dramatically different, but is actually tightly related to the other approaches.	Semantic Scholar
Our findings are validated both in simulation and on real-world data sets and can be useful for designing optimization-based visual-inertial state estimation algorithms.	Semantic Scholar

In such ambiguous regions, mathematical solutions related to binocular disparities are not unique or indefinite.	Semantic Scholar
We examine a mathematical description of depth completion that is consistent with human perception of depth for ambiguous regions.	Semantic Scholar
Using computer simulation, we demonstrate that resultant depth-maps qualitatively reproduce human depth perception of two kinds.	Semantic Scholar
The resultant depth maps produced using our model depend on the initial depth in the ambiguous region.	Semantic Scholar
Considering this dependence from psychological viewpoints, we conjecture that humans perceive completed surfaces that are affected by prior-stimuli corresponding to the initial condition of depth.	Semantic Scholar
We conducted psychological experiments to verify the model prediction.	Semantic Scholar
An ambiguous stimulus was presented after a prior stimulus removed ambiguity.	Semantic Scholar
The inter-stimulus interval (ISI) was inserted between the prior stimulus and post-stimulus.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that correlation of perception between the prior stimulus and post-stimulus depends on the ISI duration.	Semantic Scholar
Correlation is positive, negative, and nearly zero in the respective cases of short (0-200 ms), medium (200-400 ms), and long ISI (>400 ms).	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, based on our model, we propose a computational model that can explain the dependence.	Semantic Scholar
Automated manipulation of single cells is required in both biological and clinical applications.	Semantic Scholar
In clinical infertility treatments, a single motile sperm is immobilized and inserted into an egg cell for in vitro fertilization.	Semantic Scholar
Sperm immobilization is essential to ease the ensuing pick-up procedure, and importantly, it prevents the sperm tail from beating inside the egg cell, which causes a lower fertilization rate.	Semantic Scholar
For immobilizing a motile sperm, the sperm tail must be accurately positioned and aligned with the manipulation tool (e.g., laser spot).	Semantic Scholar
Manual immobilization using laser ablation has stringent skill requirements, and is not able to accurately position the sperm tail to the center of the laser spot for immobilization.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a visual servo system that is capable of accurately positioning the tail of a motile sperm relative to the laser spot for automated sperm immobilization.	Semantic Scholar
A visual servo control strategy was developed to estimate and compensate for the motion of the sperm tail.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results showed that the visual servo controller achieved a positioning accuracy of 1.7 $\mu$m, independent of sperm speed or swimming direction.	Semantic Scholar
By quantitatively evaluating the effect of laser energy on sperm immobilization, a consistent immobilization success rate of 100% was achieved (based on experiments on 900 sperms) with a throughput five times that of manual operation.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results confirmed that this automated immobilization technique did not induce damage to sperm DNA.	Semantic Scholar
A phrase is a natural, meaningful, and essential semantic unit.	Semantic Scholar
In topic modeling, visualizing phrases for individual topics is an effective way to explore and understand unstructured text corpora.	Semantic Scholar
However, from phrase quality and topical cohesion perspectives, the outcomes of existing approaches remain to be improved.	Semantic Scholar
Usually, the process of topical phrase mining is twofold: phrase mining and topic modeling.	Semantic Scholar
For phrase mining, existing approaches often suffer from order sensitive and inappropriate segmentation problems, which make them often extract inferior quality phrases.	Semantic Scholar
For topic modeling, traditional topic models do not fully consider the constraints induced by phrases, which may weaken the cohesion.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, existing approaches often suffer from losing domain terminologies since they neglect the impact of domain-level topical distribution.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose an efficient method for high quality and cohesive topical phrase mining.	Semantic Scholar
A high quality phrase should satisfy frequency, phraseness, completeness, and appropriateness criteria.	Semantic Scholar
In our framework, we integrate quality guaranteed phrase mining method, a novel topic model incorporating the constraint of phrases, and a novel document clustering method into an iterative framework to improve both phrase quality and topical cohesion.	Semantic Scholar
We also describe efficient algorithmic designs to execute these methods efficiently.	Semantic Scholar
The empirical verification demonstrates that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods from the aspects of both interpretability and efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
This paper describes progress with our agenda of formal verification of information flow security for realistic systems.	Semantic Scholar
We present CoSMed, a social media platform with verified document confidentiality.	Semantic Scholar
The system’s kernel is implemented and verified in the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL.	Semantic Scholar
For verification, we employ the framework of Bounded-Deducibility (BD) Security, previously introduced for the conference system CoCon.	Semantic Scholar
CoSMed is a second major case study in this framework.	Semantic Scholar
For CoSMed, the static topology of declassification bounds and triggers that characterized previous instances of BD Security has to give way to a dynamic integration of the triggers as part of the bounds.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that, from a theoretical viewpoint, the removal of triggers from the notion of BD Security does not restrict its expressiveness.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation of the cerebral cortex requires a combination of extensive domain-specific knowledge and efficient software.	Semantic Scholar
However, when the complexity of the biological system is combined with that of the software, the likelihood of coding errors increases, which slows model adjustments.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, few life scientists are familiar with software engineering and would benefit from simplicity in form of a high-level abstraction of the biological model.	Semantic Scholar
Our primary aim was to build a scalable cortical simulation framework for personal computers.	Semantic Scholar
We isolated an adjustable part of the domain-specific knowledge from the software.	Semantic Scholar
Next, we designed a framework that reads the model parameters from comma-separated value files and creates the necessary code for Brian2 model simulation.	Semantic Scholar
This separation allows rapid exploration of complex cortical circuits while decreasing the likelihood of coding errors and automatically using efficient hardware devices.	Semantic Scholar
Next, we tested the system on a simplified version of the neocortical microcircuit proposed by Markram and colleagues (2015).	Semantic Scholar
Our results indicate that the framework can efficiently perform simulations using Python, C++, and GPU devices.	Semantic Scholar
The most efficient device varied with computer hardware and the duration and scale of the simulated system.	Semantic Scholar
Compared to NEURON and NEST, the speed advantage of Brian2 was retained despite an overlying layer of software.	Semantic Scholar
However, the Python and C++ devices inherited the single core limitation of Brian2.	Semantic Scholar
The CxSystem framework supports exploration of complex models on personal computers and thus has the potential to facilitate research on cortical networks and systems.	Semantic Scholar
Drawing on screw theory and the virtual joint method, this paper presents a general and hierarchical approach for semianalytical stiffness modeling of parallel mechanisms.	Semantic Scholar
The stiffness model is built by two essential steps: 1) formulating the map between the stiffness matrices of platform and limbs using the duality of wrench and twist of the platform; and 2) formulating the map between stiffness matrices of a limb and a number of elastic elements in that limb using the duality of the wrench attributed to the limb and the twist of the endlink of that limb.	Semantic Scholar
By merging these two threads, the Cartesian stiffness matrix can be explicitly expressed in terms of the compliance matrices of joints and links.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach bridges the gap between two currently available approaches and is thereby very useful for evaluating stiffness over the entire workspace and investigating the influences of joint/link compliances on those of the platform in a quick and precise manner.	Semantic Scholar
A stiffness analysis for a 3-PRS parallel mechanism is presented as an example to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	Semantic Scholar
Although grasping and manipulation are key aspects of a robotic system's functionality, researchers often only have a limited selection of end effectors compatible with their manipulator base.	Semantic Scholar
This may either restrict the robotic system's full range of capabilities or force researchers to compensate for the end effector's intrinsic mechanical disadvantages through compensatory, nonoptimal control strategies.	Semantic Scholar
Advances in three-dimensional (3-D) printing have enabled researchers to quickly customize mechanisms for specific tasks, but the end product is usually not intended for extended use.	Semantic Scholar
It would be beneficial to identify strategies to augment the capabilities of additive manufacturing techniques to allow the easy and inexpensive construction of durable and functional hardware.	Semantic Scholar
To that end, this article details work on the Yale OpenHand Project, a library of lowcost, 3-D-printed, underactuated hand designs for researchers to freely implement and modify for their own use cases.	Semantic Scholar
The designs use cast flexural joints made via the hybrid deposition manufacturing (HDM) process to produce robust, impact-resistant subcomponents and help account for the structural shortcomings of fused deposition manufacturing (FDM).	Semantic Scholar
Several of these design examples are presented, evaluated, and compared with commercial alternatives.	Semantic Scholar
We hope that providing an accessible and extensible set of open-source hand designs will improve the iterative design process and produce many more options for researchers to utilize.	Semantic Scholar
Soft robots (SRs) represent one of the most significant recent evolutions in robotics.	Semantic Scholar
Designed to embody safe and natural behaviors, they rely on compliant physical structures purposefully designed to embody desirable and sometimes variable impedance characteristics.	Semantic Scholar
This article discusses the problem of controlling SRs.	Semantic Scholar
We start by observing that most of the standard methods of robotic control-e.g., high-gain robust control, feedback linearization, backstepping, and active impedance control-effectively fight against or even completely cancel the physical dynamics of the system, replacing them with a desired model.	Semantic Scholar
This defeats the purpose of introducing physical compliance.	Semantic Scholar
After all, what is the point of building soft actuators if we then make them stiff by control?	Semantic Scholar
In contact-based manipulations, the effects of the robot's actions change as contacts are made or broken.	Semantic Scholar
For example, if a robot applies an increasing upward force to an object, then the force will eventually overcome the object's weight and break the object–table contact.	Semantic Scholar
The robot can subsequently raise or lower the height of the object.	Semantic Scholar
The transition from resting on the table to not being in contact with the table is an example of a mode switch.	Semantic Scholar
The conditions for this mode switch depend on the mass of the object being manipulated.	Semantic Scholar
By modeling the mode switch, the robot can estimate the mass of the object based on the conditions when the mode switch occurs.	Semantic Scholar
The robot can also use the model to predict when the object will break contact given its mass.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluated four different autoregressive hidden Markov models for representing manipulations with mass-dependent mode switches.	Semantic Scholar
The models were successfully evaluated on pushing and lifting tasks.	Semantic Scholar
The evaluations show that the predicted object trajectories and estimated object masses are more accurate when using models that interpolate between different masses, and that consider the observed state for estimating the mode switches.	Semantic Scholar
Soft robotics is an emerging field that focuses on the development and application of soft robots.	Semantic Scholar
Due to their highly deformable features, it is difficult to model and control such robots.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we proposed a simplified model to simulate a fluidic elastomer actuator (FEA).	Semantic Scholar
The model consists of a series of line segments connected by viscoelastic joints.	Semantic Scholar
Pneumatic inputs were modeled as active torques acting at each joint.	Semantic Scholar
The Lagrangian dynamic equations were derived.	Semantic Scholar
An optimization-based method was proposed to identify the unknown model parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments were conducted using three-dimensional (3D) printed FEAs.	Semantic Scholar
Calibration results of a single FEA showed the repeatability of the pressure actuated bending angles, and the proposed dynamic model can precisely reproduce the deformation behavior of the FEA.	Semantic Scholar
Grasping experiments showed that the proposed dynamic model can predict the grasping forces, which was validated by a separate experiment of grasping force measurement.	Semantic Scholar
The presented methods can be extended to model other soft robots.	Semantic Scholar
This paper discusses octonion-valued neural networks (OVNNs) with leakage delay, time-varying delays, and distributed delays, for which the states, weights, and activation functions belong to the normed division algebra of octonions.	Semantic Scholar
The octonion algebra is a nonassociative and noncommutative generalization of the complex and quaternion algebras, but does not belong to the category of Clifford algebras, which are associative.	Semantic Scholar
In order to avoid the nonassociativity of the octonion algebra and also the noncommutativity of the quaternion algebra, the Cayley-Dickson construction is used to decompose the OVNNs into 4 complex-valued systems.	Semantic Scholar
By using appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, with double and triple integral terms, the free weighting matrix method, and simple and double integral Jensen inequalities, delay-dependent criteria are established for the exponential stability of the considered OVNNs.	Semantic Scholar
The criteria are given in terms of complex-valued linear matrix inequalities, for two types of Lipschitz conditions which are assumed to be satisfied by the octonion-valued activation functions.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, two numerical examples illustrate the feasibility, effectiveness, and correctness of the theoretical results.	Semantic Scholar
With the increasing imaging and processing capabilities of today's mobile devices, user authentication using iris biometrics has become feasible.	Semantic Scholar
However, as the acquisition conditions become more unconstrained and as image quality is typically lower than dedicated iris acquisition systems, the accurate segmentation of iris regions is crucial for these devices.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, an end to end Fully Convolutional Deep Neural Network (FCDNN) design is proposed to perform the iris segmentation task for lower-quality iris images.	Semantic Scholar
The network design process is explained in detail, and the resulting network is trained and tuned using several large public iris datasets.	Semantic Scholar
A set of methods to generate and augment suitable lower quality iris images from the high-quality public databases are provided.	Semantic Scholar
The network is trained on Near InfraRed (NIR) images initially and later tuned on additional datasets derived from visible images.	Semantic Scholar
Comprehensive inter-database comparisons are provided together with results from a selection of experiments detailing the effects of different tunings of the network.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the proposed model is compared with SegNet-basic, and a near-optimal tuning of the network is compared to a selection of other state-of-art iris segmentation algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
The results show very promising performance from the optimized Deep Neural Networks design when compared with state-of-art techniques applied to the same lower quality datasets.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose TunnelSlice, which enables natural acquisition of subspace in an augmented scene from an egocentric view, even for scenarios involving ambiguous center objects or object occlusion.	Semantic Scholar
In wearable augmented reality (AR), approaching a three-dimensional (3-D) region including the objects of interest has become more important than approaching distant objects one by one.	Semantic Scholar
However, existing ray-based volumetric selection through a head worn display accompanies difficulties in defining a desired 3-D region due to obstacles by occlusion and depth perception.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed TunnelSlice effectively determines a cuboid transform, excluding unnecessary areas of a user-defined tunnel via two-handed pinch-based procedural slicing from an egocentric view.	Semantic Scholar
Through six scenarios involving central object status and different occlusion levels, we conducted a user study of TunnelSlice.	Semantic Scholar
Compared with two existing approaches, TunnelSlice was preferred by the subjects and showed greater stability for all scenarios, and outperformed the other approaches in a scenario involving strong occlusion without a central object.	Semantic Scholar
TunnelSlice is thus expected to serve as a key technology for spatial protocol and interaction using a subspace in wearable AR.	Semantic Scholar

In this paper, we deal with the problem of rule-based entity resolution on imprecise temporal data.	Semantic Scholar
Entity resolution (ER) is widely explored in research community, but the problem on temporal data, especially without available timestamps, has not been studied well yet.	Semantic Scholar
Because of the elapsing of time, records referring to the same entity observed in different time periods may be different.	Semantic Scholar
Besides traditional similarity-based ER approaches, by carefully exploring several data quality rules, e.g., matching dependency and data currency, much information can be obtained to facilitate to cope with this problem.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we use such rules to derive temporal records’ information of time order and trend of their attributes’ evolvement with elapsing of time.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we first block records into smaller blocks, and then by exploring data currency constraints, we propose a temporal clustering approach with two steps, i.e., the skeleton clustering and the banding clustering.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on both real and synthetic data show that our entity resolution method can achieve both high accuracy and efficiency on datasets with hidden temporal information.	Semantic Scholar
The established approach to 3D keypoint detection consists in defining effective handcrafted saliency functions based on geometric cues with the aim of maximizing keypoint repeatability.	Semantic Scholar
Differently, the idea behind our work is to learn a descriptor-specific keypoint detector so as to optimize the end-to-end performance of the feature matching pipeline.	Semantic Scholar
Accordingly, we cast 3D keypoint detection as a classification problem between surface patches that can or cannot be matched correctly by a given 3D descriptor, i.e.	Semantic Scholar
those either good or not in respect to that descriptor.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a machine learning framework that allows for defining examples of good surface patches from the training data and leverages Random Forest classifiers to realize both fixed-scale and adaptive-scale 3D keypoint detectors.	Semantic Scholar
Through extensive experiments on standard datasets, we show how feature matching performance improves significantly by deploying 3D descriptors together with companion detectors learned by our methodology with respect to the adoption of established state-of-the-art 3D detectors based on hand-crafted saliency functions.	Semantic Scholar
Censoring is a common phenomenon that arises in many longitudinal studies where an event of interest could not be recorded within the given time frame.	Semantic Scholar
Censoring causes missing time-to-event labels, and this effect is compounded when dealing with datasets which have high amounts of censored instances.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, dependent censoring in the data, where censoring is dependent on the covariates in the data leads to bias in standard survival estimators.	Semantic Scholar
This motivates us to develop an approach for pre-processing censored data which calibrates the right censored (RC) times in an attempt to reduce the bias in the survival estimators.	Semantic Scholar
This calibration is done using an imputation method which estimates the sparse inverse covariance matrix over the dataset in an iterative convergence framework.	Semantic Scholar
During estimation, we apply row and column-based regularization to account for both row and column-wise correlations between different instances while imputing them.	Semantic Scholar
This is followed by comparing these imputed censored times with the original RC times to obtain the final calibrated RC times.	Semantic Scholar
These calibrated RC times can now be used in the survival dataset in place of the original RC times for more effective prediction.	Semantic Scholar
One of the major benefits of our calibration approach is that it is a pre-processing method for censored data which can be used in conjunction with any survival prediction algorithm and improve its performance.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate the goodness of our approach using a wide array of survival prediction algorithms which are applied over crowdfunding data, electronic health records (EHRs), and synthetic censored datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results indicate that our calibration method improves the AUC values of survival prediction algorithms, compared to applying them directly on the original survival data.	Semantic Scholar
With significant advances in imaging technology, multiple images of a person or an object are becoming readily available in a number of real-life scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to single images, image sets can capture a broad range of variations in the appearance of a single face or object.	Semantic Scholar
Recognition from these multiple images (i.e., image set classification) has gained significant attention in the area of computer vision.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike many existing approaches, which assume that only the images in the same set affect each other, this work develops a group collaborative representation (GCR) model which makes no such assumption, and which can effectively determine the hidden structure among image sets.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, GCR takes advantage of the relationship between image sets to capture the inter- and intra-set variations, and it determines the characteristic subspaces of all the gallery sets.	Semantic Scholar
In these subspaces, individual gallery images and each probe set can be effectively represented via a self-representation learning scheme, which leads to increased discriminative ability and enhances robustness and efficiency of the prediction process.	Semantic Scholar
By conducting extensive experiments and comparing with state-of-the-art, we demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method on set-based face recognition and object categorization tasks.	Semantic Scholar

Generalized linear models (GLMs) have a wide range of applications in systems neuroscience describing the encoding of stimulus and behavioral variables, as well as the dynamics of single neurons.	Semantic Scholar
However, in any given experiment, many variables that have an impact on neural activity are not observed or not modeled.	Semantic Scholar
Here we demonstrate, in both theory and practice, how these omitted variables can result in biased parameter estimates for the effects that are included.	Semantic Scholar
In three case studies, we estimate tuning functions for common experiments in motor cortex, hippocampus, and visual cortex.	Semantic Scholar
We find that including traditionally omitted variables changes estimates of the original parameters and that modulation originally attributed to one variable is reduced after new variables are included.	Semantic Scholar
In GLMs describing single-neuron dynamics, we then demonstrate how postspike history effects can also be biased by omitted variables.	Semantic Scholar
Here we find that omitted variable bias can lead to mistaken conclusions about the stability of single-neuron firing.	Semantic Scholar
Omitted variable bias can appear in any model with confounders—where omitted variables modulate neural activity and the effects of the omitted variables covary with the included effects.	Semantic Scholar
Understanding how and to what extent omitted variable bias affects parameter estimates is likely to be important for interpreting the parameters and predictions of many neural encoding models.	Semantic Scholar
Synapses are the communication channels for information transfer between neurons; these are the points at which pulse-like signals are converted into the stochastic release of quantized amounts of chemical neurotransmitter.	Semantic Scholar
At many synapses, prior neuronal activity depletes synaptic resources, depressing subsequent responses of both spontaneous and spike-evoked releases.	Semantic Scholar
We analytically compute the information transmission rate of a synaptic release site, which we model as a binary asymmetric channel.	Semantic Scholar
Short-term depression is incorporated by assigning the channel a memory of depth one.	Semantic Scholar
A successful release, whether spike evoked or spontaneous, decreases the probability of a subsequent release; if no release occurs on the following time step, the release probabilities recover back to their default values.	Semantic Scholar
We prove that synaptic depression can increase the release site’s information rate if spontaneous release is more strongly depressed than spike-evoked release.	Semantic Scholar
When depression affects spontaneous and evoked release equally, the information rate must invariably decrease, even when the rate is normalized by the resources used for synaptic transmission.	Semantic Scholar
For identical depression levels, we analytically disprove the hypothesis, at least in this simplified model, that synaptic depression serves energy- and information-efficient encoding.	Semantic Scholar
Understanding short texts is crucial to many applications, but challenges abound.	Semantic Scholar
First, short texts do not always observe the syntax of a written language.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, traditional natural language processing tools, ranging from part-of-speech tagging to dependency parsing, cannot be easily applied.	Semantic Scholar
Second, short texts usually do not contain sufficient statistical signals to support many state-of-the-art approaches for text mining such as topic modeling.	Semantic Scholar
Third, short texts are more ambiguous and noisy, and are generated in an enormous volume, which further increases the difficulty to handle them.	Semantic Scholar
We argue that semantic knowledge is required in order to better understand short texts.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we build a prototype system for short text understanding which exploits semantic knowledge provided by a well-known knowledgebase and automatically harvested from a web corpus.	Semantic Scholar
Our knowledge-intensive approaches disrupt traditional methods for tasks such as text segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and concept labeling, in the sense that we focus on semantics in all these tasks.	Semantic Scholar
We conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation on real-life data.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that semantic knowledge is indispensable for short text understanding, and our knowledge-intensive approaches are both effective and efficient in discovering semantics of short texts.	Semantic Scholar

In this letter, we propose a novel procedure for three-dimensional layout recovery of indoor scenes from single 360 $^\circ$ panoramic images.	Semantic Scholar
With such images, all scene is seen at once, allowing us to recover closed geometries.	Semantic Scholar
Our method combines strategically the accuracy provided by geometric reasoning (lines and vanishing points) with the higher level of data abstraction and pattern recognition achieved by deep learning techniques (edge and normal maps).	Semantic Scholar
Thus, we extract structural corners from which we generate layout hypotheses of the room assuming Manhattan world.	Semantic Scholar
The best layout model is selected, achieving good performance on both simple rooms (box-type), and complex shaped rooms (with more than four walls).	Semantic Scholar
Experiments of the proposed approach are conducted within two public datasets, SUN360 and Stanford (2D-3D-S) demonstrating the advantages of estimating layouts by combining geometry and deep learning and the effectiveness of our proposal with respect to the state of the art.	Semantic Scholar

This article describes an approach to building a cost-effective and research-grade visual-inertial (VI) odometry-aided vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) platform.	Semantic Scholar
We utilize an off-the-shelf VI sensor, an onboard computer, and a quadrotor platform, all of which are factory calibrated and mass produced, thereby sharing similar hardware and sensor specifications [e.g., mass, dimensions, intrinsic and extrinsic of camera-inertial measurement unit (IMU) systems, and signal-to-noise ratio].

We then perform system calibration and identification, enabling the use of our VI odometry, multisensor fusion (MSF), and model predictive control (MPC) frameworks with off-the-shelf products.	Semantic Scholar
This approach partially circumvents the tedious parameter-tuning procedures required to build a full system.	Semantic Scholar

In robotics, especially in this era of autonomous driving, mapping is one key ability of a robot to be able to navigate through an environment, localize on it, and analyze its traversability.	Semantic Scholar
To allow for real-time execution on constrained hardware, the map usually estimated by feature-based or semidense SLAM algorithms is a sparse point cloud; a richer and more complete representation of the environment is desirable.	Semantic Scholar
Existing dense mapping algorithms require extensive use of graphics processing unit (GPU) computing and they hardly scale to large environments; incremental algorithms from sparse points still represent an effective solution when light computational effort is needed and big sequences have to be processed in real time.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we improved and extended the state-of-the-art incremental manifold mesh algorithm proposed by Litvinov and Lhuillier and extended by Romanoni and Matteucci.	Semantic Scholar
While these algorithms do not reconstruct the map in real time and they embed points from SLAM or structure from motion only when their position is fixed, in this letter, we propose the first incremental algorithm able to reconstruct a manifold mesh in real time through single core CPU processing, which is also able to modify the mesh according to three-dimensional points updates from the underlying SLAM algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
We tested our algorithm against two state-of-the-art incremental mesh mapping systems on the KITTI dataset, and we showed that, while accuracy is comparable, our approach is able to reach real-time performances thanks to an order of magnitude speed-up.	Semantic Scholar

Sensing technology is an integral part of any autonomous system.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, two-dimensional (2-D) range sensors have played a critical role in localization, mapping, and other sensing tasks in robotics.	Semantic Scholar
But, 2-D measurements provide limited information about the environment, while 3-D range sensors provide a better understanding of the environment for the robot to make crucial decisions.	Semantic Scholar
However, 3-D range sensors presently available in market are too costly to be deployed by small robots and in large numbers.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we introduce a novel low cost 3-D range sensor, developed using an affordable 2-D lidar.	Semantic Scholar
A high speed servo is used to nod the lidar and generate 3-D perception of surrounding environment.	Semantic Scholar

This letter presents a displacement self-sensing method for piezoelectric actuators that takes into account the effect of the deformation of these latter on their electrical impedance.	Semantic Scholar
A self-updating digital electrical impedance equivalent to that of the piezoelement is suggested in order to overcome the mismatch problem met when considering a static analog electrical impedance as classically used.	Semantic Scholar
Then, the design of an observer that performs a thorough separation of the electric current due to the direct piezoelectric effect from the measured electric current is proposed in order to estimate the piezoelectric actuator displacement.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results validate the proposed approach and demonstrate the efficiency of the developed self-sensing circuit and its observer to estimate the displacement of the piezoceramics actuator for long duration measurement of constant step signal.	Semantic Scholar
In multiview learning, views may be obtained from multiple sources or extracted from a single source as different features.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, effective multiple views from skeleton sequences are proposed to learn the discriminative features using multiple networks for three-dimensional human action recognition.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, three views are constructed in the spatial domain and fed to a stack of long short-term memory networks to exploit temporal information and three views are constructed using the improved joint trajectory maps and fed to three convolutional neural networks to exploit spatial information.

Humans have the fascinating capacity of processing nonverbal visual cues to understand and anticipate the actions of other humans.	Semantic Scholar
This “intention reading” ability is underpinned by shared motor repertoires and action models, which we use to interpret the intentions of others as if they were our own.	Semantic Scholar
We investigate how different cues contribute to the legibility of human actions during interpersonal interactions.	Semantic Scholar
Our first contribution is a publicly available dataset with recordings of human body motion and eye gaze, acquired in an experimental scenario with an actor interacting with three subjects.	Semantic Scholar
From these data, we conducted a human study to analyze the importance of different nonverbal cues for action perception.	Semantic Scholar
As our second contribution, we used motion/gaze recordings to build a computational model describing the interaction between two persons.	Semantic Scholar
As a third contribution, we embedded this model in the controller of an iCub humanoid robot and conducted a second human study, in the same scenario with the robot as an actor, to validate the model's “intention reading” capability.	Semantic Scholar
Our results show that it is possible to model (nonverbal) signals exchanged by humans during interaction, and how to incorporate such a mechanism in robotic systems with the twin goal of being able to “read” human action intentionsand acting in a way that is legible by humans.	Semantic Scholar

This paper primarily concentrates on the issue of Arcak-type state estimator of delayed SNNs involving leakage delay.	Semantic Scholar
The first attempt is made to tackle the Arcak-type state estimator of SNNs with time delay in leakage term in this paper based on the unified criteria, by constructing a novel Lyapunov functional together with newly improved integral inequalities.	Semantic Scholar

The presented body-rate controller uses LQR-control methods to consider both the body rate and the single motor dynamics, which reduces the overall trajectory-tracking error while still rejecting external disturbances well.	Semantic Scholar
Our iterative thrust-mixing scheme computes the four rotor thrusts given the inputs from a position-control pipeline.	Semantic Scholar
Through the iterative computation, we are able to consider a varying ratio of thrust and drag torque of a single propeller over its input range, which allows applying the desired yaw torque more precisely and hence reduces the yaw-control error.	Semantic Scholar
Our prioritizing motor-saturation scheme improves stability and robustness of a quadrotor's flight and may prevent unstable behavior in case of motor saturations.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the improved trajectory tracking, yaw-control, and robustness in case of motor saturations in real-world experiments with a quadrotor.	Semantic Scholar
Formal verification of real time programs, where variables can change values at every time step, is difficult due to the analyses of loops with time lags.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a constraint programming model together with a global constraint and a filtering algorithm, for computing over-approximation of real-time streams.	Semantic Scholar
The global constraint handles the loop analyses by providing an interval over-approximation of the loop invariant.	Semantic Scholar
We apply our method to the FAUST language, a language for processing real-time audio streams.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments show that our approach provides accurate results in short times.	Semantic Scholar
The recent advances in state estimation, perception, and navigation algorithms have significantly contributed to the ubiquitous use of quadrotors for inspection, mapping, and aerial imaging.	Semantic Scholar
To further increase the versatility of quadrotors, recent works investigated the use of an adaptive morphology, which consists of modifying the shape of the vehicle during flight to suit a specific task or environment.	Semantic Scholar
However, these works either increase the complexity of the platform or decrease its controllability.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a novel, simpler, yet effective morphing design for quadrotors consisting of a frame with four independently rotating arms that fold around the main frame.	Semantic Scholar
To guarantee stable flight at all times, we exploit an optimal control strategy that adapts on the fly to the drone morphology.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the versatility of the proposed adaptive morphology in different tasks, such as negotiation of narrow gaps, close inspection of vertical surfaces, and object grasping and transportation.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments are performed on an actual, fully autonomous quadrotor relying solely on onboard visual-inertial sensors and compute.	Semantic Scholar
No external motion tracking systems and computers are used.	Semantic Scholar
This is the first work showing stable flight without requiring any symmetry of the morphology.	Semantic Scholar
Threshold-linear networks (TLNs) are models of neural networks that consist of simple, perceptron-like neurons and exhibit nonlinear dynamics determined by the network's connectivity.	Semantic Scholar
The fixed points of a TLN, including both stable and unstable equilibria, play a critical role in shaping its emergent dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we provide two novel characterizations for the set of fixed points of a competitive TLN: the first is in terms of a simple sign condition, while the second relies on the concept of domination.	Semantic Scholar
We apply these results to a special family of TLNs, called combinatorial threshold-linear networks (CTLNs), whose connectivity matrices are defined from directed graphs.	Semantic Scholar
This leads us to prove a series of graph rules that enable one to determine fixed points of a CTLN by analyzing the underlying graph.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we study larger networks composed of smaller building block subnetworks and prove several theorems relating the fixed points of the full network to those of its components.	Semantic Scholar
Our results provide the foundation for a kind of graphical calculus to infer features of the dynamics from a network's connectivity.	Semantic Scholar
Current solutions to the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem approach it as the optimization of a graph of geometric constraints.	Semantic Scholar
Scalability is achieved by reducing the size of the graph, usually in two phases.	Semantic Scholar
First, some selected nodes in the graph are marginalized and then, the dense and nonrelinearizable result is sparsified.	Semantic Scholar
The sparsified network has a new set of relinearizable factors and is an approximation to the original dense one.	Semantic Scholar
Sparsification is typically approached as a Kullback–Liebler divergence (KLD) minimization between the dense marginalization result and the new set of factors.	Semantic Scholar
For a simple topology of the new factors, such as a tree, there is a closed form optimal solution.	Semantic Scholar
However, more populated topologies can achieve a much better approximation because more information can be encoded, although in that case iterative optimization is needed to solve the KLD minimization.	Semantic Scholar
Iterative optimization methods proposed by the state-of-art sparsification require parameter tuning that strongly affects their convergence.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose factor descent and noncyclic factor descent, two simple algorithms for SLAM sparsification that match the state-of-art methods without any parameters to be tuned.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed methods are compared against the state of the art with regard to accuracy and CPU time, in both synthetic and real world datasets.	Semantic Scholar
As robots are increasingly entering human environments, many subtleties of socially compliant navigation are still unsolved.	Semantic Scholar
To behave in a socially compliant way, robots need to have an understanding of the natural motion paths of humans in the shared environment.	Semantic Scholar
Humans intuitively follow social norms, which allows them to navigate smoothly even in crowded environments.	Semantic Scholar
For example, when humans enter a previously unseen building, they are still able to infer from their surroundings where humans would typically walk and use this information to obviate interference.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose an approach to learn such a predictive method.	Semantic Scholar
A robot could use this information to find nondisturbing waiting positions, avoid crowded areas, or clean heavily frequented areas more often.	Semantic Scholar
We propose the use of convolutional neural networks to predict average occupancy maps of walking humans even in environments where no human trajectory data are available.	Semantic Scholar
In experiments, we show that our method transfers from simulation to real-world data and performs better than several baseline methods.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the applicability on a real robot to find good waiting positions near narrow passages as well as a planner, which avoids areas where human interference is likely.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel approach for training deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) that allows us to tradeoff complexity and accuracy to learn lightweight models suitable for robotic platforms such as AgBot II (which performs automated weed management).	Semantic Scholar
Our approach consists of three stages, the first is to adapt a pre-trained model to the task at hand.	Semantic Scholar
This provides state-of-the-art performance but at the cost of high computational complexity resulting in a low frame rate of just 0.12 frames per second (fps).	Semantic Scholar
Second, we use the adapted model and employ model compression techniques to learn a lightweight DCNN that is less accurate but has two orders of magnitude fewer parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Third, $K$ lightweight models are combined as a mixture model to further enhance the performance of the lightweight models.	Semantic Scholar
Applied to the challenging task of weed segmentation, we improve the accuracy from 85.9%, using a traditional approach, to 93.9% by adapting a complicated pre-trained DCNN with 25M parameters (Inception-v3).	Semantic Scholar
The downside to this adapted model, Adapted-IV3, is that it can only process 0.12 fps.	Semantic Scholar
To make this approach fast while still retaining accuracy, we learn lightweight DCNNs which when combined can achieve accuracy greater than 90% while using considerably fewer parameters capable of processing between 1.07 and 1.83 fps, up to an order of magnitude faster and up to an order of magnitude fewer parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Layered neural networks have greatly improved the performance of various applications including image processing, speech recognition, natural language processing, and bioinformatics.	Semantic Scholar
However, it is still difficult to discover or interpret knowledge from the inference provided by a layered neural network, since its internal representation has many nonlinear and complex parameters embedded in hierarchical layers.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, it becomes important to establish a new methodology by which layered neural networks can be understood.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a new method for extracting a global and simplified structure from a layered neural network.	Semantic Scholar
Based on network analysis, the proposed method detects communities or clusters of units with similar connection patterns.	Semantic Scholar
We show its effectiveness by applying it to three use cases.	Semantic Scholar
(1) Network decomposition: it can decompose a trained neural network into multiple small independent networks thus dividing the problem and reducing the computation time.	Semantic Scholar
(2) Training assessment: the appropriateness of a trained result with a given hyperparameter or randomly chosen initial parameters can be evaluated by using a modularity index.	Semantic Scholar
And (3) data analysis: in practical data it reveals the community structure in the input, hidden, and output layers, which serves as a clue for discovering knowledge from a trained neural network.	Semantic Scholar
In the last decade, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been a research focus for many purposes.	Semantic Scholar
Many of these studies require a path planning to perform autonomous flights, as well as the maintenance of a fixed flight level with respect to the ground to capture videos or overlying images.	Semantic Scholar
This article presents an approach to plan a mission for UAVs keeping a fixed flight level constraint.	Semantic Scholar
The 3D environment where the planning is carried out is an open field with non-uniform terrain.	Semantic Scholar
The approach proposed is based on the Fast Marching Square (FM) method, which generates a path free from obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach includes two adjustment parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Depending on the values of these parameters, the restriction of flight level can be modified, as well as the smoothness and safety of the generated paths.	Semantic Scholar
Simulated experiments carried out in this work demonstrate that the proposed approach generates trajectories respecting a fixed flight level over the ground with successful results.	Semantic Scholar
Robotic rehabilitation devices are more frequently used for the physical therapy of people with upper limb weakness, which is the most common type of stroke-induced disability.	Semantic Scholar
Rehabilitation robots can provide customized, prolonged, intensive, and repetitive training sessions for patients with neurological impairments.	Semantic Scholar
In most cases, the robotic exoskeletons have to be aligned with the human joints and provide natural arm movements.	Semantic Scholar
This is a challenging task to achieve for one of the most biomechanically complex joints of human body, i.e., the shoulder.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, specific considerations have been made in the development of various existing robotic shoulder rehabilitation orthoses.	Semantic Scholar
Different types of actuation, degrees of freedom (DOFs), and control strategies have been utilized for the development of these shoulder rehabilitation orthoses.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a comprehensive review of these shoulder rehabilitation orthoses.	Semantic Scholar
Recent advancements in the mechanism design, their advantages and disadvantages, overview of hardware, actuation system, and power transmission are discussed in detail with the emphasis on the assisted DOFs for shoulder motion.	Semantic Scholar
A brief overview of control techniques and clinical studies conducted with the developed robotic shoulder orthoses is also presented.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, current challenges and directions of future development for robotic shoulder rehabilitation orthoses are provided at the end of this paper.	Semantic Scholar
Fusion of machine learning methods benefits in decision support systems.	Semantic Scholar
A composition of approaches gives a possibility to use the most efficient features composed into one solution.	Semantic Scholar
In this article we would like to present an approach to the development of adaptive method based on fusion of proposed novel neural architecture and heuristic search into one co-working solution.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a developed neural network architecture that adapts to processed input co-working with heuristic method used to precisely detect areas of interest.	Semantic Scholar
Input images are first decomposed into segments.	Semantic Scholar
This is to make processing easier, since in smaller images (decomposed segments) developed Adaptive Artificial Neural Network (AANN) processes less information what makes numerical calculations more precise.	Semantic Scholar
For each segment a descriptor vector is composed to be presented to the proposed AANN architecture.	Semantic Scholar
Evaluation is run adaptively, where the developed AANN adapts to inputs and their features by composed architecture.	Semantic Scholar
After evaluation, selected segments are forwarded to heuristic search, which detects areas of interest.	Semantic Scholar
As a result the system returns the image with pixels located over peel damages.	Semantic Scholar
Presented experimental research results on the developed solution are discussed and compared with other commonly used methods to validate the efficacy and the impact of the proposed fusion in the system structure and training process on classification results.	Semantic Scholar

The Wilkie, Stonham, and Aleksander recognition device (WiSARD) n-tuple classifier is a multiclass weightless neural network capable of learning a given pattern in a single step.	Semantic Scholar
Its architecture is determined by the number of classes it should discriminate.	Semantic Scholar
A target class is represented by a structure called a discriminator, which is composed of N RAM nodes, each of them addressed by an n-tuple.	Semantic Scholar
Previous studies were carried out in order to mitigate an important problem of the WiSARD n-tuple classifier: having its RAM nodes saturated when trained by a large data set.	Semantic Scholar
Finding the VC dimension of the WiSARD n-tuple classifier was one of those studies.	Semantic Scholar
Although no exact value was found, tight bounds were discovered.	Semantic Scholar
Later, the bleaching technique was proposed as a means to avoid saturation.	Semantic Scholar
Recent empirical results with the bleaching extension showed that the WiSARD n-tuple classifier can achieve high accuracies with low variance in a great range of tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Theoretical studies had not been conducted with that extension previously.	Semantic Scholar
This work presents the exact VC dimension of the basic two-class WiSARD n-tuple classifier, which is linearly proportional to the number of RAM nodes belonging to a discriminator, and exponentially to their addressing tuple length, precisely N(2n-1)+1.	Semantic Scholar
The exact VC dimension of the bleaching extension to the WiSARD n-tuple classifier, whose value is the same as that of the basic model, is also produced.	Semantic Scholar
Such a result confirms that the bleaching technique is indeed an enhancement to the basic WiSARD n-tuple classifier as it does no harm to the generalization capability of the original paradigm.	Semantic Scholar

Timely, precise, and reliable detection of fall events is very important for systems monitoring activities of elderly people, especially the ones living independently.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose an autonomous fall detection system by taking a completely different view compared with existing vision-based activity monitoring systems and applying a reverse approach.	Semantic Scholar
In our system, in contrast with static sensors installed at fixed locations, the camera is worn by the subject, and thus, monitoring is not limited only to areas where the sensors are located and extends to wherever the subject may travel.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the camera provides a richer set of data and helps lower the false positive rates compared with accelerometer-only systems.	Semantic Scholar
We employ a modified version of the histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) approach together with the gradient local binary patterns (GLBP).	Semantic Scholar
It is shown that, with the same training set, the GLBP feature is more descriptive and discriminative than HOG, histograms of template, and semantic local binary patterns.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we autonomously compute a threshold, for the detection of fall events, from the training data based on relative entropy, which is a member of Ali-Silvey distance measures.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments are performed with ten different people and a total of around 300 associated fall events indoors and outdoors.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that, with the autonomously computed threshold, the proposed method provides 93.78% and 89.8% accuracy for detecting falls with indoor and outdoor experiments, respectively.	Semantic Scholar

Needle deflection during certain minimally invasive percutaneous procedures, such as prostate biopsy or brachytherapy, is undesired and can be reduced through the use of feedback control.	Semantic Scholar
This letter uses a depth-dependent reduced-order three-dimensional (3-D) nonholonomic model of needle tip motion to propose a needle deflection controller that works in a surgeon-in-the-loop fashion, where the surgeon is in charge of needle insertion, and the feedback controller is responsible for keeping the needle on its desired trajectory.	Semantic Scholar
The controller is based on a continuous-time control law that asymptotically brings needle deflection to zero and is shown to remain effective even when the magnitude of the needle rotation velocity is limited.	Semantic Scholar
Limiting of the needle rotational velocity is due to practical considerations such as to reduce tissue damage during insertion and to show a measure of velocity-independence of the controller when high insertion speeds would require unfeasibly fast rotations.	Semantic Scholar
The velocity-limited controller is evaluated in three different ex vivo tissue samples in a total of 30 needle insertion trials using real-time needle deflection measurements from ultrasound images.	Semantic Scholar
The ex vivo results show an average absolute needle tip deflection of 0.54 mm away from the target location at a depth of 120 mm, and an average needle tip deflection of 0.36 mm away from the desired target axis throughout the entire insertion length.	Semantic Scholar
As we know, the notion of dissipativity is an important dynamical property of neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, the analysis of dissipativity of neural networks with time delay is becoming more and more important in the research field.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, the authors establish a class of fractional-order complex-valued neural networks (FCVNNs) with time delay, and intensively study the problem of dissipativity, as well as global asymptotic stability of the considered FCVNNs with time delay.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the fractional Halanay inequality and suitable Lyapunov functions, some new sufficient conditions are obtained that guarantee the dissipativity of FCVNNs with time delay.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, some sufficient conditions are derived in order to ensure the global asymptotic stability of the addressed FCVNNs with time delay.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, two numerical simulations are posed to ensure that the attention of our main results are valuable.	Semantic Scholar
This paper is concerned with the problem of decentralized adaptive backstepping state-feedback control for uncertain high-order large-scale stochastic nonlinear time-delay systems.	Semantic Scholar
For the control design of high-order large-scale nonlinear systems, only one adaptive parameter is constructed to overcome the over-parameterization, and neural networks are employed to cope with the difficulties raised by completely unknown system dynamics and stochastic disturbances.	Semantic Scholar
And then, the appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and the property of hyperbolic tangent functions are used to deal with the unknown unmatched time-delay interactions of high-order large-scale systems for the first time.	Semantic Scholar
At last, on the basis of Lyapunov stability theory, the decentralized adaptive neural controller was developed, and it decreases the number of learning parameters.	Semantic Scholar
The actual controller can be designed so as to ensure that all the signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) and the tracking error converges in the small neighborhood of zero.	Semantic Scholar
The simulation example is used to further show the validity of the design method.	Semantic Scholar
Small size and low weight are critical requirements for wearable and portable haptic interfaces, making it essential to work toward the optimization of their sensing and actuation systems.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a new approach for task-driven design optimization of fingertip cutaneous haptic devices.	Semantic Scholar
Given one (or more) target tactile interactions to render and a cutaneous device to optimize, we evaluate the minimum number and best configuration of the device's actuators to minimize the estimated haptic rendering error.	Semantic Scholar
First, we calculate the motion needed for the original cutaneous device to render the considered target interaction.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we run a principal component analysis to search for possible couplings between the original motor inputs, looking also for the best way to reconfigure them.	Semantic Scholar
If some couplings exist, we can redesign our cutaneous device with fewer motors, optimally configured to render the target tactile sensation.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach is quite general and can be applied to different tactile sensors and cutaneous devices.	Semantic Scholar
We validated it using a BioTac tactile sensor and custom plate-based 3-DoF and 6-DoF fingertip cutaneous devices, considering six representative target tactile interactions.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm was able to find couplings between each device's motor inputs, proving it to be a viable approach to optimize the design of wearable and portable cutaneous devices.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we present two examples of optimized designs for our 3-DoF fingertip cutaneous device.	Semantic Scholar
Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation has become an important way to help people discover attractive and interesting places, especially when they travel out of town.	Semantic Scholar
However, the extreme sparsity of user-POI matrix and cold-start issues severely hinder the performance of collaborative filtering-based methods.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, user preferences may vary dramatically with respect to the geographical regions due to different urban compositions and cultures.	Semantic Scholar
To address these challenges, we stand on recent advances in deep learning and propose a Spatial-Aware Hierarchical Collaborative Deep Learning model (SH-CDL).	Semantic Scholar
The model jointly performs deep representation learning for POIs from heterogeneous features and hierarchically additive representation learning for spatial-aware personal preferences.	Semantic Scholar
To combat data sparsity in spatial-aware user preference modeling, both the collective preferences of the public in a given target region and the personal preferences of the user in adjacent regions are exploited in the form of social regularization and spatial smoothing.	Semantic Scholar
To deal with the multimodal heterogeneous features of the POIs, we introduce a late feature fusion strategy into our SH-CDL model.	Semantic Scholar
The extensive experimental analysis shows that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation models, especially in out-of-town and cold-start recommendation scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study global uniform asymptotic fixed deviation stability and stability for a wide class of memristive neural networks with time-varying delays.	Semantic Scholar
Firstly, a new mathematical expression of the generic memductance (memristance) is proposed according to the feature of the memristor and the general current-voltage characteristic and a new class of neural networks is designed.	Semantic Scholar
Next, a new concept of stability (fixed deviation stability) is proposed in order to describe veritably the stability characteristics of the discontinuous system and the sufficient conditions are given to guarantee the global uniform asymptotic fixed deviation stability and stability of the new system.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, two numerical examples are provided to show the applicability and effectiveness of our main results.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a two-stage strategy for optimal control problems of robotic mechanical systems that proves to be more robust, and yet more efficient, than straightforward solution strategies.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we focus on a simplified humanoid model, represented as a two-dimensional articulated serial chain of rigid bodies, in the tasks of getting up (sitting down) from (to) the supine and prone postures.	Semantic Scholar
Interactions with the environment are integral parts of these motions, and a priori unscheduled contact sequences are discovered by the solver itself, opportunistically making or breaking contacts with the ground through feet, knees, hips, elbows, and hands.	Semantic Scholar
The present investigation analyzes the effects on the computational performance of: 1) the explicit introduction of contact forces among the optimization variables, 2) the substitution of undesired contact forces with geometric constraints that prevent interpenetrations, and 3) the splitting of the planning problem into two consecutive phases of increasing complexity.	Semantic Scholar
To the best of our knowledge, these tests represent the only quantitative analysis of the performances achievable with different solution strategies for optimization-based, whole-body dynamic motion planning in the presence of contacts.	Semantic Scholar
The keep-growing content of Web images is probably the next important data source to scale up deep neural networks which recently surpass human in image classification tasks.	Semantic Scholar
The fact that deep networks are hungry for labelled data limits themselves from extracting valuable information of Web images which are abundant and cheap.	Semantic Scholar
There have been effort s to train neural networks such as autoencoders with respect to either unsupervised or semi-supervised settings.	Semantic Scholar
Nonetheless they are less performant than supervised methods partly because the loss function used in unsupervised methods, for instance Euclidean loss, failed to guide the network to learn discriminative features and ignore unnecessary details.	Semantic Scholar
We instead train convolutional networks in a supervised setting but use weakly labelled data which are large amounts of unannotated Web images downloaded from Flickr and Bing.	Semantic Scholar
Our experiments are conducted at several data scales, with different choices of network architecture, and alternating between different data preprocessing techniques.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness of our approach is shown by the good generalization of the learned representations with new six public datasets.	Semantic Scholar

Weakly supervised learning for object detection has been gaining significant attention in the recent past.	Semantic Scholar
Visually similar objects are extracted automatically from weakly labelled videos hence bypassing the tedious process of manually annotating training data.	Semantic Scholar
However, the problem as applied to small or medium sized objects is still largely unexplored.	Semantic Scholar
Our observation is that weakly labelled information can be derived from videos involving human-object interactions.	Semantic Scholar
Since the object is characterized neither by its appearance nor its motion in such videos, we propose a robust framework that taps valuable human context and models similarity of objects based on appearance and functionality.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the framework is designed such that it maximizes the utility of the data by detecting possibly multiple instances of an object from each video.	Semantic Scholar
We show that object models trained in this fashion perform between 86% and 92% of their fully supervised counterparts on three challenging RGB and RGB-D datasets.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a new compliant robotics wrist design concept.	Semantic Scholar

A promising way to offset the reduced mobility of a large number of older adults is using robotic systems providing physical and cognitive support for the navigation in large and crowded public spaces.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we study a possible solution for guidance based on the action of electromechanical brakes mounted on the rear wheels.	Semantic Scholar
The solution does not require sophisticated sensing devices and aims to share the control authority between the user and the robotic platform: the system kicks in with quick corrections only in presence of deviations from the path or of dangerous situations.	Semantic Scholar
The level of the shared authority is controlled by means of a simple parameter.	Semantic Scholar
The control paradigm is based on an all-or-nothing policy relying on very rough actuators.	Semantic Scholar
In our experimental validation, all the users have been proficient in the use of the device after a short learning time.	Semantic Scholar
The aim of a Super Resolution (SR) technique is to construct a high-resolution image from a sequence of observed low-resolution ones of the same scene.	Semantic Scholar
One major roadblock of an SR reconstitution is removing noise and blur without destroying edges.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel multiframe image SR algorithm based on a convex combination of Bilateral Total Variation and a non-smooth second order variational regularization, using a controlled weighting parameter.	Semantic Scholar
We prove the existence of a minimizer of the proposed SR model in the space of functions of bounded Hessian, and we confirm the success of this approach in avoiding undesirable artifacts.	Semantic Scholar
The simulation results show the efficient performance of the proposed algorithm compared to other methods in the literature using two criteria, PSNR and SSIM.	Semantic Scholar
Conventional active incremental structure from motion (ISfM) schemes require a precise knowledge of the linear and angular velocities of the vision system to compute the three-dimensional structure of the observed scene.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, they are generally coupled and nonlinear, which makes the reconstruction inaccurate.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a novel active ISfM scheme to overcome these difficulties.	Semantic Scholar
It relies on two appropriate transformations: the first one allows efficient decoupling of the nonlinear model, whereas the second one transforms the decoupled model into the Brunovsky's linear form.	Semantic Scholar
We then show that a Luenberger's observer can be designed to estimate the unavailable states, making our scheme globally asymptotically convergent and robust to noise on measurements.	Semantic Scholar
We present simulated and experimental results to illustrate the performance of the described methodology.	Semantic Scholar

By using Maxwell's equations, we derive and present a Bayesian nonparametric probabilistic modeling approach for interpolation and extrapolation of the magnetic field.	Semantic Scholar
We model the magnetic field components jointly by imposing a Gaussian process (GP) prior to the latent scalar potential of the magnetic field.	Semantic Scholar
By rewriting the GP model in terms of a Hilbert space representation, we circumvent the computational pitfalls associated with GP modeling and provide a computationally efficient and physically justified modeling tool for the ambient magnetic field.	Semantic Scholar
The model allows for sequential updating of the estimate and time-dependent changes in the magnetic field.	Semantic Scholar
The model is shown to work well in practice in different applications.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate mapping of the magnetic field both with an inexpensive Raspberry Pi powered robot and on foot using a standard smartphone.	Semantic Scholar
Shaping the collision selectivity in vision-based artificial collision-detecting systems is still an open challenge.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a novel neuron model of a locust looming detector, i.e.	Semantic Scholar
the lobula giant movement detector (LGMD1), in order to provide effective solutions to enhance the collision selectivity of looming objects over other visual challenges.	Semantic Scholar
We propose an approach to model the biologically plausible mechanisms of ON and OFF pathways and a biophysical mechanism of spike frequency adaptation (SFA) in the proposed LGMD1 visual neural network.	Semantic Scholar
The ON and OFF pathways can separate both dark and light looming features for parallel spatiotemporal computations.	Semantic Scholar
This works effectively on perceiving a potential collision from dark or light objects that approach; such a bio-plausible structure can also separate LGMD1's collision selectivity to its neighbouring looming detector - the LGMD2.	Semantic Scholar
The SFA mechanism can enhance the LGMD1's collision selectivity to approaching objects rather than receding and translating stimuli, which is a significant improvement compared with similar LGMD1 neuron models.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed framework has been tested using off-line tests of synthetic and real-world stimuli, as well as on-line bio-robotic tests.	Semantic Scholar
The enhanced collision selectivity of the proposed model has been validated in systematic experiments.	Semantic Scholar
The computational simplicity and robustness of this work have also been verified by the bio-robotic tests, which demonstrates potential in building neuromorphic sensors for collision detection in both a fast and reliable manner.	Semantic Scholar
An active object recognition system has the advantage of acting in the environment to capture images that are more suited for training and lead to better performance at test time.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we utilize deep convolutional neural networks for active object recognition by simultaneously predicting the object label and the next action to be performed on the object with the aim of improving recognition performance.	Semantic Scholar
We treat active object recognition as a reinforcement learning problem and derive the cost function to train the network for joint prediction of the object label and the action.	Semantic Scholar
A generative model of object similarities based on the Dirichlet distribution is proposed and embedded in the network for encoding the state of the system.	Semantic Scholar
The training is carried out by simultaneously minimizing the label and action prediction errors using gradient descent.	Semantic Scholar
We empirically show that the proposed network is able to predict both the object label and the actions on GERMS, a dataset for active object recognition.	Semantic Scholar
We compare the test label prediction accuracy of the proposed model with Dirichlet and Naive Bayes state encoding.	Semantic Scholar
The results of experiments suggest that the proposed model equipped with Dirichlet state encoding is superior in performance, and selects images that lead to better training and higher accuracy of label prediction at test time.	Semantic Scholar

With a shift in current robotics application from known, well-defined environments toward unknown environments, the robot's ability to avoid unknown obstacles in real-time while relying on limited information about spatial constraints in its path becomes essential.	Semantic Scholar
Taking inspiration from the laws of electromagnetism, we present a novel navigation method, whereby the moving robot induces an artificial electric current onto the obstacle surface generating, in turn, a magnetic field guiding the robot along the obstacle's boundary without affecting its kinetic energy.

Our method has several advantages over existing methods, which are as follows.	Semantic Scholar
1) It guides point-like robots toward the goal without suffering from local minima in 3-D environments populated with convex obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
2) It does not need any prior knowledge of obstacle positions and geometries.	Semantic Scholar
3) It only requires environmental sensor information that is spatially and temporally local to generate motion commands iteratively.	Semantic Scholar

Constantly shorter product lifecycles and the high number of product variants necessitate frequent production system reconfigurations and changeovers.	Semantic Scholar
Shortening ramp-up and changeover times is essential to achieve the agility required to respond to these challenges.	Semantic Scholar
This work investigates a symbiotic human–machine environment, which combines a formal framework for capturing structured ramp-up experiences from expert production engineers with a reinforcement learning method to formulate effective ramp-up policies.	Semantic Scholar
Such learned policies have been shown to reduce unnecessary iterations in human decision-making processes by suggesting the most appropriate actions for different ramp-up states.	Semantic Scholar
One of the key challenges for machine learning-based methods, particularly for episodic problems with complex state-spaces, such as ramp-up, is the exploration strategy that can maximize the information gain while minimizing the number of exploration steps required to find good policies.

The proposed approach combines human intelligence with machine's capability for processing data quickly, accurately, and reliably.	Semantic Scholar
The efficiency of the proposed human exploration guided machine learning strategy is assessed by comparing it with three machine-based exploration strategies.	Semantic Scholar
To test and compare the four strategies, a ramp-up emulator was built, based on system experimentation and user experience.	Semantic Scholar
The results of the experiments show that human-guided exploration can achieve close to optimal behavior, with far less data than what is needed for traditional machine-based strategies.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a new method that uses an iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm to fit three‐ dimensional points to a prior geometric model for the purpose of determining the position and orientation (pose) of a sensor with respect to a model.	Semantic Scholar
We use a method similar to the Random Sample and Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
However, where RANSAC uses random samples of points in the fitting trials, DIRSAC DIRects the sampling by ordering the points according to their contribution to the solution constraints.	Semantic Scholar
This is particularly important when the data is quasi‐degenerate; meaning that some of the degrees of freedom of the pose are under constrained.	Semantic Scholar
In this case, the standard RANSAC algorithm often fails to find the correct solution.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach uses mutual information to avoid redundant points that result in degenerate sample sets.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate our approach on real data and show that in the case of quasi‐degenerate data, the proposed algorithm outperforms RANSAC.	Semantic Scholar
Clustering of data with high dimension and variable densities poses a remarkable challenge to the traditional density-based clustering methods.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, entropy, a numerical measure of the uncertainty of information, can be used to measure the border degree of samples in data space and also select significant features in feature set.	Semantic Scholar
It was used in our new framework based on the sparsity-density entropy (SDE) to cluster the data with high dimension and variable densities.	Semantic Scholar
First, SDE conducts high-quality sampling for multidimensional data and selects the representative features using sparsity score entropy (SSE).	Semantic Scholar
Second, the clustering results and noises are obtained adopting a new density-variable clustering method called density entropy (DE).	Semantic Scholar
DE automatically determines the border set based on the global minimum of border degrees and then adaptively performs cluster analysis for each local cluster based on the local minimum of border degrees.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed SDE framework are validated on synthetic and real data sets in comparison with several clustering algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
The results showed that the proposed SDE framework concurrently detected the noises and processed the data with high dimension and various densities.	Semantic Scholar
Compared with stiff actuators, series elastic actuators (SEAs) can render more accurate output torque and stiffness.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, SEAs are suitable for robots that need to interact safely with human or properly with the actual or virtual environment.	Semantic Scholar
Many existing rotary SEAs are bulky and not suitable for multiple-degree-of-freedom (DoF) applications.	Semantic Scholar
To explore the merits of SEAs in bilateral teleoperations that often require multiple-DoF force feedback, this letter presents a miniature rotary SEA.	Semantic Scholar
By using a specifically designed planar spring, the size of the SEA can be minimized while the output torque and stiffness can still be accurately controlled.	Semantic Scholar
Dynamic modeling and impedance control experiments show that the torque and stiffness rendering results are better than those of existing SEAs.	Semantic Scholar
A master-slave robot system using the proposed SEA demonstrates that both stiff and soft remote environments can be virtually realized.	Semantic Scholar
We expect that this miniature SEA can serve as an alternative actuator for robotic teleoperations requiring accurate torque sensing and control.	Semantic Scholar
In modern big data warehouse systems, we observe a common phenomenon that a column of data values can be derived from one or several other columns by transforming and concatenating these columns.	Semantic Scholar
We call this relationship between columns a Soft Concatenation Mapping (SCM).	Semantic Scholar
SCMs imply significant redundancy in the schema or data, and therefore can be exploited for data integration or data compression.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we formalize the problem of SCM detection and prove it is NP-hard.	Semantic Scholar
We then propose efficient approximate algorithms to detect all SCMs or an optimal set of SCMs in a table.	Semantic Scholar
Our experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets show promising results.	Semantic Scholar
This letter considers an augmented kinematic formulation for nonprehensile manipulation through intermittent contacts as occurring in catching, batting, or juggling.	Semantic Scholar
In such scenarios, the contact point with an end-effector is variable, which we propose to model with additional virtual joints at the end of the kinematic chain.	Semantic Scholar
While not in contact with the manipulated part, these new joints are unconstrained in terms of velocity and acceleration.	Semantic Scholar
An optimization based and, thus, tuning-free comparison of differential inverse kinematic approaches is carried out, given path or trajectory of the manipulation task is known.	Semantic Scholar
Simulations and an experiment show that the proposed augmentation enables dynamically feasible acceleration variations at high velocities on and close to a given path.	Semantic Scholar
The ease of use and versatility of drones has contributed to their deployment in several fields, from entertainment to search and rescue.	Semantic Scholar
However, drones remain vulnerable to collisions due to pilot mistakes or various system failures.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a bioinspired strategy for the design of quadcopters resilient to collisions.	Semantic Scholar
Abstracting the biomechanical strategy of collision resilient insects’ wings, the quadcopter has a dual-stiffness frame that rigidly withstands aerodynamic loads within the flight envelope, but can soften and fold during a collision to avoid damage.	Semantic Scholar
The dual-stiffness frame works in synergy with specific energy absorbing materials that protect the sensitive components of the drone hosted in the central case.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach is compared to other state-of-the art collision-tolerance strategies and is validated in a 50-g quadcopter that can withstand high-speed collisions.	Semantic Scholar
The research focus in aerial robotics is shifting from contactless inspection toward interaction and manipulation, with the number of potential applications rapidly increasing [1].	Semantic Scholar
Eventually, aerial manipulators, i.e., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with manipulators, will likely take on hazardous maintenance tasks now performed by humans.	Semantic Scholar
For this to happen, aerial manipulators must be able to perform all the different operations required in these maintenance routines.	Semantic Scholar
The skyline operator has attracted considerable attention recently due to its broad applications.	Semantic Scholar
However, computing a skyline is challenging today since we have to deal with big data.	Semantic Scholar
For data-intensive applications, the MapReduce framework has been widely used recently.	Semantic Scholar
"In this paper, we propose the efficient parallel algorithm <italic>SKY-MR <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$^+$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""park-ieq1-2654459.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula></italic> for processing skyline queries using MapReduce."	Semantic Scholar
We first build a quadtree-based histogram for space partitioning by deciding whether to split each leaf node judiciously based on the benefit of splitting in terms of the estimated execution time.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we apply the dominance power filtering method to effectively prune non-skyline points in advance.	Semantic Scholar
We next partition data based on the regions divided by the quadtree and compute candidate skyline points for each partition using MapReduce.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we check whether each skyline candidate point is actually a skyline point in every partition using MapReduce.	Semantic Scholar
We also develop the workload balancing methods to make the estimated execution times of all available machines to be similar.	Semantic Scholar

Should a legged robot use different gaits at different desired speeds?	Semantic Scholar
If so, what constitutes these gaits?	Semantic Scholar
This work examines these questions through a case study on the planar bipedal robot RAMone.	Semantic Scholar
Using a realistic model of the robot, this paper presents the outcome of a series of trajectory optimizations which minimize the electrical cost of transport and find the associated optimal motion strategies.	Semantic Scholar
These optimizations show that at low speeds it is most economical to perform a ballistic walking gait with an instantaneous transfer of support.	Semantic Scholar
At higher speeds, spring-mass running with an extended air-phase becomes the optimal gait.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, it is illustrated that the optimal running gait is conducted with the knee joints pointing away from rather than towards the direction of travel.	Semantic Scholar
The transition between ballistic walking and spring-mass running happens at a speed of 1.04 m/s, and switching can reduce energy expenditure by up to 259%.	Semantic Scholar
We define a new method for proof mining by CERES (cut-elimination by resolution) that is concerned with the extraction of expansion trees in first-order logic (see Miller in Stud Log 46(4):347–370, 1987) with equality.	Semantic Scholar
In the original CERES method expansion trees can be extracted from proofs in normal form (proofs without quantified cuts) as a post-processing of cut-elimination.	Semantic Scholar
More precisely they are extracted from an ACNF, a proof with at most atomic cuts.	Semantic Scholar
We define a novel method avoiding proof normalization and show that expansion trees can be extracted from the resolution refutation and the corresponding proof projections.	Semantic Scholar
We prove that the new method asymptotically outperforms the standard method (which first computes the ACNF and then extracts an expansion tree).	Semantic Scholar
Finally we compare an implementation of the new method with the old one; it turns out that the new method is also more efficient in our experiments.	Semantic Scholar
Tracking and shape estimation of flexible robots that navigate through the human anatomy are prerequisites to safe intracorporeal control.	Semantic Scholar
Despite extensive research in kinematic and dynamic modeling, inaccuracies and shape deformation of the robot due to unknown loads and collisions with the anatomy make shape sensing important for intraoperative navigation.	Semantic Scholar
To address this issue, vision-based solutions have been explored.	Semantic Scholar
The task of 2-D tracking and 3-D shape reconstruction of flexible robots as they reach deep-seated anatomical locations is challenging, since the image acquisition techniques usually suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio or slow temporal responses.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, tracking and shape estimation are thus far treated independently despite their coupled relationship.	Semantic Scholar
This paper aims to address tracking and shape estimation in a unified framework based on Markov random fields.	Semantic Scholar
By using concentric tube robots as an example, the proposed algorithm fuses information extracted from standard monoplane X-ray fluoroscopy with the kinematics model to achieve joint 2-D tracking and 3-D shape estimation in realistic clinical scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
Detailed performance analyses of the results demonstrate the accuracy of the method for both tracking and shape reconstruction.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a new video Super-Resolution (SR) method by jointly modeling intra-frame redundancy and inter-frame motion context in a unified deep network.	Semantic Scholar
Different from conventional methods, the proposed Spatial-Temporal Recurrent Residual Network (STR-ResNet) investigates both spatial and temporal residues, which are represented by the difference between a high resolution (HR) frame and its corresponding low resolution (LR) frame and the difference between adjacent HR frames, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
This spatial-temporal residual learning model is then utilized to connect the intra-frame and inter-frame redundancies within video sequences in a recurrent convolutional network and to predict HR temporal residues in the penultimate layer as guidance to benefit estimating the spatial residue for video SR. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed STR-ResNet is able to efficiently reconstruct videos with diversified contents and complex motions, which outperforms the existing video SR approaches and offers new state-of-the-art performances on benchmark datasets.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a novel soft inflatable arm is proposed for telepresence robots.	Semantic Scholar
The new proposed structure of the arm is achieved by a very common and low-cost inflatable material and it is very light, weighing only about 50 g. However, it can realize agile movement by driving six tiny cables installed in the shoulder and elbow joints.	Semantic Scholar
The soft inflatable arm can work by pumping air at a very low pressure ($7.32 \pm 3.45$ kPa) and allows direct and soft human contact without any external force sensors.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes joint compressed models, joint kinematic models, and kinematic models for the whole inflatable robot arm.	Semantic Scholar
These models can be easily applied to multijoint arms.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, a new redundancy resolution method is also developed for the inflatable arm, which makes it easier to control resolution and is less complex than other traditional approaches.	Semantic Scholar
Numerous experiments have been conducted, including performances of accuracy, repeatability, motion trajectories, human-safe interaction, and remote interaction.	Semantic Scholar
Results are satisfactory and validate the expected performance of the proposed robotic arm.	Semantic Scholar
The art gallery problem or museum problem is a well-known visibility problem in computational geometry.	Semantic Scholar
It originates from a real-world problem of guarding an art gallery with the minimum number of guards who together can observe the whole gallery.	Semantic Scholar
This letter deals with a variant of the art gallery problem in which guards are deployed to track a mobile intruder.	Semantic Scholar
We consider a team of <italic>free</italic> guards equipped with omnidirectional cameras deployed to track a bounded speed intruder inside a simply connected polygonal environment.	Semantic Scholar
We present a partitioning technique for any simply connected polygon using its diagonals such that each partition is at most a nonagon.	Semantic Scholar
Next, we propose an event-triggered strategy for a single guard to track an intruder around a reflex vertex.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the proposed strategy, we formulate the problem of finding the minimum speed of the guard and its corresponding trajectory inside any partition as a convex-optimization problem.	Semantic Scholar
The solution to the convex-optimization problem provides an upper bound on the speed of the mobile guard required for persistent tracking of the mobile intruder.	Semantic Scholar
"Furthermore, we show that the number of guards deployed by the proposed technique belongs to <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mathcal {O}(\frac{2n}{7})$</tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\Omega (\frac{n}{6})$</tex-math></inline-formula>, which is strictly less than <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\lfloor {\frac{n}{3}} \rfloor$</tex-math></inline-formula> (sufficient and sometimes necessary number of guards required for coverage)."	Semantic Scholar
"Finally, we extend the analysis to orthogonal polygons, and show that the upper bound on the number of guards deployed for tracking is strictly less than <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\lfloor {\frac{n}{4}} \rfloor$</tex-math></inline-formula> which is sufficient and sometimes necessary for the coverage problem."	Semantic Scholar
Finding actions that satisfy the constraints imposed by both external inputs and internal representations is central to decision making.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate that some important classes of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) can be solved by networks composed of homogeneous cooperative-competitive modules that have connectivity similar to motifs observed in the superficial layers of neocortex.	Semantic Scholar
The winner-take-all modules are sparsely coupled by programming neurons that embed the constraints onto the otherwise homogeneous modular computational substrate.	Semantic Scholar
We show rules that embed any instance of the CSP's planar four-color graph coloring, maximum independent set, and sudoku on this substrate and provide mathematical proofs that guarantee these graph coloring problems will convergence to a solution.	Semantic Scholar
The network is composed of nonsaturating linear threshold neurons.	Semantic Scholar
Their lack of right saturation allows the overall network to explore the problem space driven through the unstable dynamics generated by recurrent excitation.	Semantic Scholar
The direction of exploration is steered by the constraint neurons.	Semantic Scholar
While many problems can be solved using only linear inhibitory constraints, network performance on hard problems benefits significantly when these negative constraints are implemented by nonlinear multiplicative inhibition.	Semantic Scholar
Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of instability rather than stability in network computation and offer insight into the computational role of dual inhibitory mechanisms in neural circuits.	Semantic Scholar
The current paper examines how a recurrent neural network (RNN) model using a dynamic predictive coding scheme can cope with fluctuations in temporal patterns through generalization in learning.	Semantic Scholar
The conjecture driving this present inquiry is that a RNN model with multiple timescales (MTRNN) learns by extracting patterns of change from observed temporal patterns, developing an internal dynamic structure such that variance in initial internal states account for modulations in corresponding observed patterns.	Semantic Scholar
We trained a MTRNN with low-dimensional temporal patterns, and assessed performance on an imitation task employing these patterns.	Semantic Scholar
Analysis reveals that imitating fluctuated patterns consists in inferring optimal internal states by error regression.	Semantic Scholar
The model was then tested through humanoid robotic experiments requiring imitative interaction with human subjects.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that spontaneous and lively interaction can be achieved as the model successfully copes with fluctuations naturally occurring in human movement patterns.	Semantic Scholar
Shared control is an increasingly popular approach to facilitate control and communication between humans and intelligent machines.	Semantic Scholar
However, there is little consensus in guidelines for design and evaluation of shared control, or even in a definition of what constitutes shared control.	Semantic Scholar
This lack of consensus complicates cross fertilization of shared control research between different application domains.	Semantic Scholar
This paper provides a definition for shared control in context with previous definitions, and a set of general axioms for design and evaluation of shared control solutions.	Semantic Scholar
The utility of the definition and axioms are demonstrated by applying them to four application domains: automotive, robot-assisted surgery, brain–machine interfaces, and learning.	Semantic Scholar
Literature is discussed for each of these four domains in light of the proposed definition and axioms.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, to facilitate design choices for other applications, we propose a hierarchical framework for shared control that links the shared control literature with traded control, co-operative control, and other human–automation interaction methods.	Semantic Scholar
Future work should reveal the generalizability and utility of the proposed shared control framework in designing useful, safe, and comfortable interaction between humans and intelligent machines.	Semantic Scholar
Memristor is firstly postulated by Leon Chua and realized by Hewlett-Packard (HP) laboratory.	Semantic Scholar
Research results show that memristor can be used to simulate the synapses of neurons.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a class of recurrent neural network with HP memristors.	Semantic Scholar
Firstly, it shows that memristive recurrent neural network has more compound dynamics than the traditional recurrent neural network by simulations.	Semantic Scholar
Then it derives that n dimensional memristive recurrent neural network is composed of [Formula: see text] sub neural networks which do not have a common equilibrium point.	Semantic Scholar
By designing the tracking controller, it can make memristive neural network being convergent to the desired sub neural network.	Semantic Scholar
At last, two numerical examples are given to verify the validity of our result.	Semantic Scholar
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) can be regarded as a static or dynamic classification problem, which makes SER an excellent test bed for investigating and comparing various deep learning architectures.	Semantic Scholar
We describe a frame-based formulation to SER that relies on minimal speech processing and end-to-end deep learning to model intra-utterance dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
We use the proposed SER system to empirically explore feed-forward and recurrent neural network architectures and their variants.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments conducted illuminate the advantages and limitations of these architectures in paralinguistic speech recognition and emotion recognition in particular.	Semantic Scholar
As a result of our exploration, we report state-of-the-art results on the IEMOCAP database for speaker-independent SER and present quantitative and qualitative assessments of the models' performances.	Semantic Scholar
The Operational Space Formulation (OSF) from the 1980s is probably the most frequently applied task-space controller in robotics.	Semantic Scholar
In multipriority control of redundant robots via the OSF, a feedback linearization is performed on the first hierarchy level while lower-priority tasks are executed in the dynamically consistent null space of the Jacobian matrices of all higher-priority tasks without disturbing them.	Semantic Scholar
However, it has been observed in the past that a formal stability analysis for the overall closed loop is rather difficult, especially for the null space dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
Except for exponential stability on the main task level, a complete proof is still missing when the tasks conflict with each other.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we provide this formal proof of asymptotic stability for the regulation case of a passivity-based OSF controller by means of conditional stability theory and semidefinite Lyapunov functions.	Semantic Scholar
Simulations support the intuitive, energy-based interpretation of the proof.	Semantic Scholar
This stability analysis lifts the widely used OSF onto a more solid foundation.	Semantic Scholar

Additionally, the main objectives of the tutorial and the required software to complete it are presented.	Semantic Scholar

Many algorithms can be implemented most efficiently with imperative data structures.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents Sepref, a stepwise refinement based tool chain for the verification of imperative algorithms in Isabelle/HOL.	Semantic Scholar
As a back end we use imperative HOL, which allows to generate verified imperative code.	Semantic Scholar
On top of imperative HOL, we develop a separation logic framework with powerful proof tactics.	Semantic Scholar
We use this framework to verify basic imperative data structures and to define a refinement calculus between imperative and functional programs.	Semantic Scholar
We provide a tool to automatically synthesize a concrete imperative program and a refinement proof from an abstract functional program, selecting implementations of abstract data types according to a user-provided configuration.	Semantic Scholar
As a front end to describe the abstract programs, we use the Isabelle Refinement Framework, for which many algorithms have already been formalized.	Semantic Scholar
Our tool chain is complemented by a large selection of verified imperative data structures.	Semantic Scholar
We have used Sepref for several verification projects, resulting in efficient verified implementations that are competitive with unverified ones in Java or C $$++$$ + + .	Semantic Scholar
Natural language is a flexible and powerful control modality which can transform a wheelchair from a vehicle into a genuine helper.	Semantic Scholar
While autonomous wheelchairs are increasingly designed to use natural language for control, most of them only handle a small number of rigid commands.	Semantic Scholar
To establish the state-of-the-art in language-enabled wheelchairs and determine how to improve natural language capabilities, we introduce a framework for analyzing and classifying properties of language-enabled wheelchairs.	Semantic Scholar
We then apply the framework to the twenty-four most recent natural language-enabled wheelchair projects, in order to compare their achievements and identify areas for improvement.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we systematically investigate the impact of class imbalance on classification performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and compare frequently used methods to address the issue.	Semantic Scholar
Class imbalance is a common problem that has been comprehensively studied in classical machine learning, yet very limited systematic research is available in the context of deep learning.	Semantic Scholar
In our study, we use three benchmark datasets of increasing complexity, MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, to investigate the effects of imbalance on classification and perform an extensive comparison of several methods to address the issue: oversampling, undersampling, two-phase training, and thresholding that compensates for prior class probabilities.	Semantic Scholar
Our main evaluation metric is area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) adjusted to multi-class tasks since overall accuracy metric is associated with notable difficulties in the context of imbalanced data.	Semantic Scholar
Based on results from our experiments we conclude that (i) the effect of class imbalance on classification performance is detrimental; (ii) the method of addressing class imbalance that emerged as dominant in almost all analyzed scenarios was oversampling; (iii) oversampling should be applied to the level that completely eliminates the imbalance, whereas the optimal undersampling ratio depends on the extent of imbalance; (iv) as opposed to some classical machine learning models, oversampling does not cause overfitting of CNNs; (v) thresholding should be applied to compensate for prior class probabilities when overall number of properly classified cases is of interest.

Magnetic micromanipulation has the advantage of untethered control, high precision, and biocompatibility and has recently undergone great advances.	Semantic Scholar
The magnetic micromanipulation task to tackle in this paper is to three dimensionally navigate a 5-$\mu$m magnetic bead inside a mouse embryo and accurately apply forces to intraembryonic structures to perform mechanical measurements at multiple locations.	Semantic Scholar
Existing technologies are not able to achieve these navigation and measurement goals because of poor magnetic force scaling and/or lacking the capability of applying an accurately controlled force.	Semantic Scholar
This paper reports a three-dimensional magnetic tweezer system that enables, for the first time, intraembryonic magnetic navigation and force application.	Semantic Scholar
A single magnetic bead was introduced into a mouse embryo via robotic microinjection.	Semantic Scholar
The magnetic tweezer system accurately controlled the position of the magnetic bead via visually servoed magnetic control.	Semantic Scholar
By moving the magnetic bead with known forces inside the embryo, cytoplasm viscosity was measured, which is eight times the viscosity of water.	Semantic Scholar
For performing mechanical measurements on the cellular structures inside the mouse embryo, the system should be capable of applying forces up to 120 pN with a resolution of 4 pN.	Semantic Scholar
The results revealed that the middle region is significantly more deformable than the side regions of the inner cell mass.	Semantic Scholar
This paper is concerned with the global Mittag-Leffler synchronization and the synchronization in finite time for fractional-order neural networks (FNNs) with discontinuous activations and time delays.	Semantic Scholar
Firstly, the properties with respect to Mittag-Leffler convergence and convergence in finite time, which play a critical role in the investigation of the global synchronization of FNNs, are developed, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
Secondly, the novel state-feedback controller, which includes time delays and discontinuous factors, is designed to realize the synchronization goal.	Semantic Scholar
By applying the fractional differential inclusion theory, inequality analysis technique and the proposed convergence properties, the sufficient conditions to achieve the global Mittag-Leffler synchronization and the synchronization in finite time are addressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the upper bound of the setting time of the global synchronization in finite time is explicitly evaluated.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, two examples are given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed design method and theoretical results.	Semantic Scholar

The field of robotic surgery increasingly advances towards highly articulated and continuum robots, requiring new kinematic strategies to enable users to perform dexterous manipulation in confined workspaces.	Semantic Scholar
This development is driven by surgical interventions accessing the surgical workspace through natural orifices such as the mouth or the anus.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the long and narrow nature of these access pathways, external triangulation at the fulcrum point is very limited or absent, which makes introducing multiple degrees of freedom at the distal end of the instrument necessary.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, high force and miniaturization requirements make the control of such instruments particularly challenging.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents the kinematic considerations needed to effectively manipulate these novel instruments and allow us their dexterous control in confined spaces.	Semantic Scholar
A nonlinear calibration model is further used to map joint to actuator space and improve significantly the precision of the instrument's motion.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness of the presented approach is quantified with bench tests, and the usability of the system is assessed by three user studies simulating the requirements of a realistic surgical task.	Semantic Scholar
Heterogeneous information networks that consist of multi-type, interconnected objects are becoming increasingly popular, such as social media networks and bibliographic networks.	Semantic Scholar
The task of linking named entity mentions detected from unstructured Web text with their corresponding entities in a heterogeneous information network is of practical importance for the problem of information network population.	Semantic Scholar
This task is challenging due to name ambiguity and limited knowledge existing in the network.	Semantic Scholar
Most existing entity linking methods focus on linking entities with Wikipedia and cannot be applied to our task.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present SHINE+, a general framework for linking named entitieS in Web free text with a Heterogeneous I nformation NEtwork.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a probabilistic linking model, which unifies an entity popularity model with an entity object model.	Semantic Scholar
As the entity knowledge contained in the information network is insufficient, we propose a knowledge population algorithm to iteratively enrich the network entity knowledge by leveraging the context information of mentions mapped by the linking model with high confidence, which subsequently boosts the linking performance.

Transfer learning has the potential to reduce the burden of data collection and to decrease the unavoidable risks of the training phase.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we introduce a multirobot, multitask transfer learning framework that allows a system to complete a task by learning from a few demonstrations of another task executed on another system.	Semantic Scholar
We focus on the trajectory tracking problem where each trajectory represents a different task, since many robotic tasks can be described as a trajectory tracking problem.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed multirobot transfer learning framework is based on a combined ${\mathcal{L}_1}$ adaptive control and an iterative learning control approach.	Semantic Scholar
The key idea is that the adaptive controller forces dynamically different systems to behave as a specified reference model.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed multitask transfer learning framework uses theoretical control results (e.g., the concept of vector relative degree) to learn a map from desired trajectories to the inputs that make the system track these trajectories with high accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
This map is used to calculate the inputs for a new, unseen trajectory.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results using two different quadrotor platforms and six different trajectories show that, on average, the proposed framework reduces the first-iteration tracking error by 74% when information from tracking a different single trajectory on a different quadrotor is utilized.	Semantic Scholar
Biological networks have long been known to be modular, containing sets of nodes that are highly connected internally.	Semantic Scholar
Less emphasis, however, has been placed on understanding how intermodule connections are distributed within a network.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we borrow ideas from engineered circuit design and study Rentian scaling, which states that the number of external connections between nodes in different modules is related to the number of nodes inside the modules by a power-law relationship.	Semantic Scholar
We tested this property in a broad class of molecular networks, including protein interaction networks for six species and gene regulatory networks for 41 human and 25 mouse cell types.	Semantic Scholar
Using evolutionarily defined modules corresponding to known biological processes in the cell, we found that all networks displayed Rentian scaling with a broad range of exponents.	Semantic Scholar
We also found evidence for Rentian scaling in functional modules in the Caenorhabditis elegans neural network, but, interestingly, not in three different social networks, suggesting that this property does not inevitably emerge.	Semantic Scholar
To understand how such scaling may have arisen evolutionarily, we derived a new graph model that can generate Rentian networks given a target Rent exponent and a module decomposition as inputs.	Semantic Scholar
Overall, our work uncovers a new principle shared by engineered circuits and biological networks.	Semantic Scholar
Many real-world problems involve learning models for rare classes in situations where there are no gold standard labels for training samples but imperfect labels are available for all instances.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present RAPT, a three step predictive modeling framework for classifying rare class in such problem settings.	Semantic Scholar
The first step of the proposed framework learns a classifier that jointly optimizes precision and recall by only using imperfectly labeled training samples.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that, under certain assumptions on the imperfect labels, the quality of this classifier is almost as good as the one constructed using perfect labels.	Semantic Scholar
The second and third steps of the framework make use of the fact that imperfect labels are available for all instances to further improve the precision and recall of the rare class.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate the RAPT framework on two real-world applications of mapping forest fires and urban extent from earth observing satellite data.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results indicate that RAPT can be used to identify forest fires and urban areas with high precision and recall by using imperfect labels, even though obtaining expert annotated samples on a global scale is infeasible in these applications.	Semantic Scholar
This letter proposes a novel human–robot collaboration (HRC) control approach to alert and reduce the static joint torque overloading of a human partner while executing shared tasks with a robot.	Semantic Scholar
Using a preidentified statically equivalent serial chain model, variations of the centre-of-pressure and ground reaction force are calculated, and the overloading joint torques are evaluated in real time to initially alert the human about consequent injuries.	Semantic Scholar
An online optimization technique is implemented to adjust the robot trajectories facilitating the human to achieve more ergonomic body poses throughout the HRC task.	Semantic Scholar
The optimized human configurations are calculated by taking into account the human stability, the robot, and the human workspaces, and the task constraints, and illustrated to the human in real time.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental evaluation of the proposed technique is achieved in a human–robot load sharing task as a representative example of coassembly or transportation scenarios in industrial settings.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we identify passive dynamic bounding gaits of quadrupedal robots and investigate the dynamic similarities between these gaits and those of a bipedal model.	Semantic Scholar
For this purpose, we develop a passive dynamic bounding model of a quadruped with an extended main body.	Semantic Scholar
This model is based on the established SLIP model, yet has dynamic swing leg motions instead of a predefined angle of attack.	Semantic Scholar
We present a gait-identification framework that is based on a numerical continuation approach and that allows us to find all possible passive periodic motions that emerge from pronking and bounding in place.	Semantic Scholar
These gaits include forward pronking as well as forward bounding with gathered suspension, extended suspension, and with two suspensions.	Semantic Scholar
By conducting a parameter study on the body inertia, we can draw parallels between bipedal and quadrupedal gaits, and can also show how the structure of possible solutions changes with the main body inertia.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we see sudden changes in the gait structure at certain critical values of the main body inertia.	Semantic Scholar
This letter shows connections between different types of quadrupedal gaits and may serve as a guideline in the design and control of gaits for energetically economical legged robots.	Semantic Scholar
It also sheds some light at the question why animals with different morphology use different gaits at the same Froude numbers.	Semantic Scholar

Furthermore, the data contributors are usually unwilling to reveal their sensitive personal data and real identities to the data consumers.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose TPDM, which efficiently integrates Truthfulness and Privacy preservation in Data Markets.	Semantic Scholar
TPDM is structured internally in an Encrypt-then-Sign fashion, using partially homomorphic encryption and identity-based signature.	Semantic Scholar
It simultaneously facilitates batch verification, data processing, and outcome verification, while maintaining identity preservation and data confidentiality.	Semantic Scholar
We also instantiate TPDM with a profile matching service and a data distribution service, and extensively evaluate their performances on Yahoo!	Semantic Scholar
Music ratings dataset and 2009 RECS dataset, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
Our analysis and evaluation results reveal that TPDM achieves several desirable properties, while incurring low computation and communication overheads when supporting large-scale data markets.	Semantic Scholar
Image transformation between multiple domains has become a challenging problem in deep generative networks.	Semantic Scholar
This is because, in real-world applications, finding paired images in different domains is an expensive and impractical task.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a new model named joint moment-matching autoencoders(JMA).	Semantic Scholar
This model learns to perform cross-domain transformation over multiple domains based on perceptual loss and maximum mean discrepancy criteria, in the absence of any paired images between the domains.	Semantic Scholar
Our results show that the proposed JMA framework successfully learns to transform images between domains without any paired data.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate that our model has good performance in the generative context as well as in the domain transformation tasks with better computational efficiency than conventional methods.	Semantic Scholar
Rank data, in which each row is a complete or partial ranking of available items (columns), is ubiquitous.	Semantic Scholar
Among others, it can be used to represent preferences of users, levels of gene expression, and outcomes of sports events.	Semantic Scholar
It can have many types of patterns, among which consistent rankings of a subset of the items in multiple rows, and multiple rows that rank the same subset of the items highly.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we show that the problems of finding such patterns can be formulated within a single generic framework that is based on the concept of semiring matrix factorization.	Semantic Scholar
In this framework, we employ the max-product semiring rather than the plus-product semiring common in traditional linear algebra.	Semantic Scholar
We apply this semiring matrix factorization framework on two tasks: sparse rank matrix factorization and rank matrix tiling.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets show that the framework is capable of discovering different types of structure as well as obtaining high quality solutions.	Semantic Scholar
Robot-assisted medical interventions, such as robotic catheter ablation, often require the robot to perform tasks on a tissue surface.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a task-space motion planning method that generates actuation trajectories that steer the end-effector of the MRI-actuated continuum robot along desired trajectories on the surface.	Semantic Scholar
The continuum robot is modeled using the pseudo-rigid-body model, where the continuum body of the robot is approximated by rigid links joined by flexible joints.	Semantic Scholar
The quasistatic motion model of the robot is formulated as a potential energy minimization problem.	Semantic Scholar
The Jacobian of the quasistatic motion model is used in calculating the actuations that steer the tip in the desired directions.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method is validated experimentally in a clinical 3-T MRI scanner.	Semantic Scholar
Collaborative robots (cobots) are a category of robots designed to work together with humans.	Semantic Scholar
By combining the fortes of the robot, such as precision and strength, with the dexterity and problem-solving ability of the human, it is possible to accomplish tasks that cannot be fully automated and improve the production quality and working conditions of employees [6], [16].	Semantic Scholar
This article presents the results of the ClaXon project, which studies and implements interactions between humans and cobots in factories.	Semantic Scholar
The project has led to the integration of a cobot in the Audi car manufacturing plant in Brussels, Belgium.	Semantic Scholar
The economic emission dispatch (EED) problem aims to control generation cost and reduce the impact of waste gas on the environment.	Semantic Scholar
It has multiple constraints and nonconvex objectives.	Semantic Scholar
To solve it, the collective neurodynamic optimization (CNO) method, which combines heuristic approach and projection neural network (PNN), is attempted to optimize scheduling of an electrical microgrid with ten thermal generators and minimize the plus of generation and emission cost.	Semantic Scholar
As the objective function has non-derivative points considering valve point effect (VPE), differential inclusion approach is employed in the PNN model introduced to deal with them.	Semantic Scholar
Under certain conditions, the local optimality and convergence of the dynamic model for the optimization problem is analyzed.	Semantic Scholar
The capability of the algorithm is verified in a complicated situation, where transmission loss and prohibited operating zones are considered.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the dynamic variation of load power at demand side is considered and the optimal scheduling of generators within 24 h is described.	Semantic Scholar
While model checking has often been considered as a practical alternative to building formal proofs, we argue here that the theory of sequent calculus proofs can be used to provide an appealing foundation for model checking.	Semantic Scholar
Since the emphasis of model checking is on establishing the truth of a property in a model, we rely on additive inference rules since these provide a natural description of truth values via inference rules.	Semantic Scholar
Unfortunately, using these rules alone can force the use of inference rules with an infinite number of premises.	Semantic Scholar
In order to accommodate more expressive and finitary inference rules, we also allow multiplicative rules but limit their use to the construction of additive synthetic inference rules: such synthetic rules are described using the proof-theoretic notions of polarization and focused proof systems.	Semantic Scholar
This framework provides a natural, proof-theoretic treatment of reachability and non-reachability problems, as well as tabled deduction, bisimulation, and winning strategies.	Semantic Scholar
Human motion recognition is one of the most important branches of human-centered research activities.	Semantic Scholar
In recent years, motion recognition based on RGB-D data has attracted much attention.	Semantic Scholar
Along with the development in artificial intelligence, deep learning techniques have gained remarkable success in computer vision.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved great success for image-based tasks, and recurrent neural networks (RNN) are renowned for sequence-based problems.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, deep learning methods based on the CNN and RNN architectures have been adopted for motion recognition using RGB-D data.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a detailed overview of recent advances in RGB-D-based motion recognition is presented.	Semantic Scholar
The reviewed methods are broadly categorized into four groups, depending on the modality adopted for recognition: RGBbased, depth-based, skeleton-based and RGB+D-based.	Semantic Scholar
As a survey focused on the application of deep learning to RGB-D-based motion recognition, we explicitly discuss the advantages and limitations of existing techniques.	Semantic Scholar
Particularly, we highlighted the methods of encoding spatial-temporal-structural information inherent in video sequence, and discuss potential directions for future research.	Semantic Scholar
We study a multi-instance (MI) learning dimensionality-reduction algorithm through sparsity and orthogonality, which is especially useful for high-dimensional MI data sets.	Semantic Scholar
We develop a novel algorithm to handle both sparsity and orthogonality constraints that existing methods do not handle well simultaneously.	Semantic Scholar
Our main idea is to formulate an optimization problem where the sparse term appears in the objective function and the orthogonality term is formed as a constraint.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting optimization problem can be solved by using approximate augmented Lagrangian iterations as the outer loop and inertial proximal alternating linearized minimization (iPALM) iterations as the inner loop.	Semantic Scholar
The main advantage of this method is that both sparsity and orthogonality can be satisfied in the proposed algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
We show the global convergence of the proposed iterative algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
We also demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve high sparsity and orthogonality requirements, which are very important for dimensionality reduction.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets show that the proposed algorithm can obtain learning performance comparable to that of other tested MI learning algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Rough Cognitive Networks (RCNs) are a kind of granular neural network that augments the reasoning rule present in Fuzzy Cognitive Maps with crisp information granules coming from Rough Set Theory.	Semantic Scholar
While RCNs have shown promise in solving different classification problems, this model is still very sensitive to the similarity threshold upon which the rough information granules are built.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we cast the RCN model within the framework of fuzzy rough sets in an attempt to eliminate the need for a user-specified similarity threshold while retaining the model's discriminatory power.	Semantic Scholar
As far as we know, this is the first study that brings fuzzy sets into the domain of rough cognitive mapping.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical results in the presence of 140 well-known pattern classification problems reveal that our approach, referred to as Fuzzy-Rough Cognitive Networks, is capable of outperforming most traditional classifiers used for benchmarking purposes.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we explore the impact of using different heterogeneous distance functions and fuzzy operators over the performance of our granular neural network.	Semantic Scholar
How does one obtain an admissible heuristic for a kinodynamic motion planning problem?	Semantic Scholar
This letter develops the analytical tools and techniques to answer this question.	Semantic Scholar
A sufficient condition for the admissibility of a heuristic is presented, which can be checked directly from problem data.	Semantic Scholar
This condition is also used to formulate an infinite-dimensional linear program to optimize an admissible heuristic.	Semantic Scholar
We then investigate the use of sum-of-squares programming techniques to obtain an approximate solution to this linear program.	Semantic Scholar
A number of examples are provided to demonstrate these new concepts.	Semantic Scholar

We present a wearable skin stretch device for the forearm.	Semantic Scholar
It is composed of four cylindrical end effectors, evenly distributed around the user's forearm.	Semantic Scholar
They can generate independent skin stretch stimuli at the palmar, dorsal, ulnar, and radial sides of the arm.	Semantic Scholar
When the four end effectors rotate in the same direction, the wearable device provides cutaneous stimuli about a desired pronation/supination of the forearm.	Semantic Scholar
On the other hand, when two opposite end effectors rotate in different directions, the cutaneous device provides cutaneous stimuli about a desired translation of the forearm.	Semantic Scholar
To evaluate the effectiveness of our device in providing navigation information, we carried out two experiments of haptic navigation.	Semantic Scholar
In the first one, subjects were asked to translate and rotate the forearm toward a target position and orientation, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
In the second experiment, subjects were asked to control a 6-DoF robotic manipulator to grasp and lift a target object.	Semantic Scholar
Haptic feedback provided by our wearable device improved the performance of both experiments with respect to providing no haptic feedback.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, it showed similar performance with respect to sensory substitution via visual feedback, without overloading the visual channel.	Semantic Scholar

This letter proposes a novel approach using the -norm regularization for the sparse covariance matrix estimation (SCME) problem.	Semantic Scholar
The objective function of SCME problem is composed of a nonconvex part and the term, which is discontinuous and difficult to tackle.	Semantic Scholar
Appropriate DC (difference of convex functions) approximations of -norm are used that result in approximation SCME problems that are still nonconvex.	Semantic Scholar
DC programming and DCA (DC algorithm), powerful tools in nonconvex programming framework, are investigated.	Semantic Scholar
Two DC formulations are proposed and corresponding DCA schemes developed.	Semantic Scholar
Two applications of the SCME problem that are considered are classification via sparse quadratic discriminant analysis and portfolio optimization.	Semantic Scholar
A careful empirical experiment is performed through simulated and real data sets to study the performance of the proposed algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical results showed their efficiency and their superiority compared with seven state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
Online environment dynamic estimates are often used for the control of robots, telerobots, and haptic systems.	Semantic Scholar
The nonlinear Hunt–Crossley (HC) model, which is physically consistent with the behavior of soft objects with limited deformation at a single point of contact, is being increasingly used in robotic control systems.	Semantic Scholar
The HC model can be identified online using a single-stage log linearization technique; however, the accuracy and applicability of the existing method is limited.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a two-stage polynomial identification method, which uses a quadratic approximation in the first stage to generate a linearly parameterized model of the HC dynamics (Quad-Poly).	Semantic Scholar
The coefficients of the Quad-Poly model are then used in the second stage to extract the HC parameters using a lookup table and recursive least squares parameter estimation.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method is experimentally assessed against a previous natural logarithm linearization method, and further tested for time-varying environment dynamics and human-generated trajectories and for robustness against uncertainties in the measured data and system parameters.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we illustrate geometric relation distribution (GRD), a novel signature for place recognition and loop closure with landmark maps.	Semantic Scholar
GRD encodes geometric pairwise relations between landmark points into a continuous probability density function.	Semantic Scholar
The pairwise angles are represented by von Mises distribution whereas two alternative distributions, Erlang or biased Rayleigh, are proposed for distances.	Semantic Scholar
The GRD function is represented through its expansion into Fourier series and Laguerre polynomial basis.	Semantic Scholar
Such orthogonal basis representation enables efficient computation of the translation and rotation invariant metric used to compare signatures and find potential loop closure candidates.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness of the proposed method is assessed through experiments with standard datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Self-organised emergent patterns can be widely seen in natural and man-made complex systems generated by interactions among local components without external or global control.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a survey of recent research advances in self-organising pattern formation in mobile multi-robot (or swarm robotic) systems.	Semantic Scholar
Relevant pattern formation methods are reviewed with a special focus on biologicallyinspired self-organising approaches inspired from macroscopic collective behaviours or microscopic multicellular developing mechanisms.	Semantic Scholar
As the ultimate goal of this review is to provide insight into pattern formation using real robots, limitations and considerations on dealing with a large number of robots are discussed.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, guided self-organisation is also discussed as a design strategy where the swarm robotic system may be endowed with local rules for generating desired global patterns.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised framework for automatically generating bottom up class independent object candidates for detection and recognition in cluttered indoor environments.	Semantic Scholar
Utilizing raw depth map from active sensors such as Kinect, we propose a novel plane segmentation algorithm for dividing an indoor scene into predominant planar regions and non-planar regions.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this partition, we are able to effectively predict object locations and their spatial extensions.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach automatically generates object proposals considering five different aspects: Non-planar Regions (NPR), Planar Regions (PR), Detected Planes (DP), Merged Detected Planes (MDP) and Hierarchical Clustering (HC) of 3D point clouds.	Semantic Scholar
Object region proposals include both bounding boxes and instance segments.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach achieves very competitive results and is even able to outperform supervised state-of-the-art algorithms on the challenging NYU-v2 RGB-Depth dataset.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we apply our approach to the most recently released large scale RGB-Depth dataset from Princeton University – “SUN RGBD”, which utilizes four different depth sensors.	Semantic Scholar
Its consistent performance demonstrates a general applicability of our approach.	Semantic Scholar

In this paper, we present a novel bottom-up saliency detection algorithm from the perspective of covariance matrices on a Riemannian manifold.	Semantic Scholar
Each superpixel is described by a region covariance matrix on Riemannian Manifolds.	Semantic Scholar
We carry out a two-stage sparse coding scheme via Log-Euclidean kernels to extract salient objects efficiently.	Semantic Scholar
In the first stage, given background dictionary on image borders, sparse coding of each region covariance via Log-Euclidean kernels is performed.	Semantic Scholar
The reconstruction error on the background dictionary is regarded as the initial saliency of each superpixel.	Semantic Scholar
In the second stage, an improvement of the initial result is achieved by calculating reconstruction errors of the superpixels on foreground dictionary, which is extracted from the first stage saliency map.	Semantic Scholar
The sparse coding in the second stage is similar to the first stage, but is able to effectively highlight the salient objects uniformly from the background.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, three post-processing methods-highlight-inhibition function, context-based saliency weighting, and the graph cut-are adopted to further refine the saliency map.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on four public benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall and mean absolute error, and demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
Knowledge acquisition is an iterative process.	Semantic Scholar
Most previous work has focused on bootstrapping techniques based on syntactic patterns, that is, each iteration finds more syntactic patterns for subsequent extraction.	Semantic Scholar
However, syntactic bootstrapping is incapable of resolving the inherent ambiguities in the syntactic patterns.	Semantic Scholar
The precision of the extracted results is thus often poor.	Semantic Scholar
On the other hand, semantic bootstrapping bootstraps directly on knowledge rather than on syntactic patterns, that is, it uses existing knowledge to understand the text and acquire more knowledge.	Semantic Scholar
It has been shown that semantic bootstrapping can achieve superb precision while retaining good recall.	Semantic Scholar
Nonetheless, the working mechanism of semantic bootstrapping remains elusive.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of semantic bootstrapping from a theoretical perspective.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the efficiency and effectiveness of semantic bootstrapping can be theoretically guaranteed.	Semantic Scholar
Our experimental evaluation results substantiate the theoretical analysis.	Semantic Scholar
Motor activities during daily life always involve simultaneous control of multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs), which has not yet been fully explored in myoelectric control due to difficulty in sufficiently decoding the complex neural control information.	Semantic Scholar
This study presents a novel framework for simultaneous myoelectric control based on pattern recognition incorporated with a muscle synergy motor control strategy for each DOF.	Semantic Scholar
An experiment for discriminating 18 dexterous finger movement tasks was designed to evaluate the performance of the framework for the simultaneous control of 5 DOFs.	Semantic Scholar
Task discrimination was assessed with 18 neurologically intact subjects, and the framework exhibited high accuracy (96.79% ±2.46%), outperforming three other methods, including the routine myoelectric pattern-recognition approach for conventional sequential control (p<0.001).	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the feasibility of the proposed framework is also demonstrated with data from paretic muscles of two stroke subjects.	Semantic Scholar
This study offers a feasible solution for simultaneous myoelectric control of multiple DOFs, which has great potential for natural implementation in prosthetic hand devices and robotic training systems, especially for dexterous finger movements.	Semantic Scholar
The k Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) query has been gaining more importance in extensive applications involving information retrieval, data mining, and databases.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, in order to trade off accuracy for efficiency, approximate solutions for the k-NN query are extensively explored.	Semantic Scholar
However, the precision is usually order-insensitive, which is defined on the result set instead of the result sequence.	Semantic Scholar
In many situations, it cannot reasonably reflect the query result quality.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we focus on the approximate  k-NN query problem with the order-sensitive precision requirement and propose a novel scheme based on the projection-filter-refinement framework.	Semantic Scholar
Basically, we adopt PCA to project the high-dimensional data objects into the low-dimensional space.	Semantic Scholar
Then, a filter condition is inferred to execute efficient pruning over the projected data.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, an index strategy named OR-tree is proposed to reduce the I/O cost.	Semantic Scholar
The extensive experiments based on several real-world data sets and a synthetic data set are conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution.	Semantic Scholar
Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method can support order-sensitive k -NN queries with higher result precision while retaining satisfactory CPU and I/O efficiency.	Semantic Scholar

We present ORB-SLAM2, a complete simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system for monocular, stereo and RGB-D cameras, including map reuse, loop closing, and relocalization capabilities.	Semantic Scholar
The system works in real time on standard central processing units in a wide variety of environments from small hand-held indoors sequences, to drones flying in industrial environments and cars driving around a city.	Semantic Scholar
Our back-end, based on bundle adjustment with monocular and stereo observations, allows for accurate trajectory estimation with metric scale.	Semantic Scholar
Our system includes a lightweight localization mode that leverages visual odometry tracks for unmapped regions and matches with map points that allow for zero-drift localization.	Semantic Scholar
The evaluation on 29 popular public sequences shows that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, being in most cases the most accurate SLAM solution.	Semantic Scholar
We publish the source code, not only for the benefit of the SLAM community, but with the aim of being an out-of-the-box SLAM solution for researchers in other fields.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a novel text representation paradigm and a set of follow-up text representation models based on cognitive psychology theories.	Semantic Scholar
The intuition of our study is that the knowledge implied in a large collection of documents may improve the understanding of single documents.	Semantic Scholar
Based on cognitive psychology theories, we propose a general text enrichment framework, study the key factors to enable activation of implicit information, and develop new text representation methods to enrich text with the implicit information.	Semantic Scholar
Our study aims to mimic some aspects of human cognitive procedure in which given stimulant words serve to activate understanding implicit concepts.	Semantic Scholar
By incorporating human cognition into text representation, the proposed models advance existing studies by mining implicit information from given text and coordinating with most existing text representation approaches at the same time, which essentially bridges the gap between explicit and implicit information.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on multiple tasks show that the implicit information activated by our proposed models matches human intuition and significantly improves the performance of the text mining tasks as well.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a map-less visual navigation system for biped humanoid robots, which extracts information from color images to derive motion commands using deep reinforcement learning (DRL).	Semantic Scholar
The map-less visual navigation policy is trained using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) algorithm, which corresponds to an actor-critic DRL algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm is implemented using two separate networks, one for the actor and one for the critic, but with similar structures.	Semantic Scholar
In addition to convolutional and fully connected layers, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers are included to address the limited observability present in the problem.	Semantic Scholar
As a proof of concept, we consider the case of robotic soccer using humanoid NAO V5 robots, which have reduced computational capabilities, and low-cost Red - Green - Blue (RGB) cameras as main sensors.	Semantic Scholar
The use of DRL allowed to obtain a complex and high performant policy from scratch, without any prior knowledge of the domain, or the dynamics involved.	Semantic Scholar
The visual navigation policy is trained in a robotic simulator and then successfully transferred to a physical robot, where it is able to run in 20 ms, allowing its use in real-time applications.	Semantic Scholar
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of methods dealing with visibility enhancement of images taken in hazy or foggy scenes.	Semantic Scholar
The survey begins with discussing the optical models of atmospheric scattering media and image formation.	Semantic Scholar

We also provide a benchmark of a number of well known single-image methods, based on a recent dataset provided by Fattal [1] and our newly generated scattering media dataset that contains ground truth images for quantitative evaluation.	Semantic Scholar
To our knowledge, this is the first benchmark using numerical metrics to evaluate dehazing techniques.	Semantic Scholar
This benchmark allows us to objectively compare the results of existing methods and to better identify the strengths and limitations of each method.	Semantic Scholar

We propose an algorithm for handling visual occlusions that disrupt visual tracking of high-dimensional eye-in-hand systems.	Semantic Scholar
Our algorithm allows a robot to look behind an occluder during active visual target search and reacquire its target in an online manner.	Semantic Scholar
A particle filter continuously estimates the target location and an enhanced observation model updates the target belief state.	Semantic Scholar
Meanwhile, we build a simple but efficient map of the occluder boundaries to compute potential occlusion-clearing motions.	Semantic Scholar
Our mixed-initiative cost function balances the goal of gaining more information about the target and occluder boundary while minimizing the sensor action cost.	Semantic Scholar
A data-driven planner uses informed samples to strike a balance between target search and information gain to avoid exhaustive mapping of the three-dimensional occluder into Configuration space.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the capabilities of our algorithm in simulation and a real-world experiment.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that our proposed solvers outperform a common approach in the literature.	Semantic Scholar
Our results indicate that our algorithm can quickly obtain clear views of the target when occlusion is persistent and significant camera motion is required.	Semantic Scholar
Searching for associations between entities is needed in many domains like national security and bioinformatics.	Semantic Scholar
In recent years, it has been facilitated by the emergence of graph-structured semantic data on the Web, which offers structured semantic associations more explicit than those hiding in unstructured text for computers to discover.	Semantic Scholar
The increasing volume of semantic data often produces excessively many semantic associations, and requires ranking techniques to identify the more important ones for users.	Semantic Scholar
Despite the fruitful theoretical research on innovative ranking techniques, there is a lack of comprehensive empirical evaluation of these techniques.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we carry out an extensive evaluation of eight techniques for ranking semantic associations, including two novel ones we propose.	Semantic Scholar
The practical effectiveness of these techniques is assessed based on 1,200 ground-truth rankings created by 30 human experts for real-life semantic associations and the explanations given by the experts.	Semantic Scholar
Our findings also suggest a number of directions in improving existing techniques and developing novel techniques for future work.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we propose a novel passive mechanism and a macro?mini architecture for effective and intuitive physical human?robot interaction (pHRI).	Semantic Scholar
The macro?mini concept allows the use of a mini low-impedance passive (LIP) mechanism to effortlessly and intuitively control a macro high-impedance active (HIA) system such as a gantry manipulator.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed mini LIP design is based on a three-degrees-of-freedom (3-DoF) translational parallel mechanism, which makes it simple and compact, thereby adding little inertia to the end-effector of the macro HIA mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents an experimental study on balance recovery control with a lower limb exoskeleton robot.	Semantic Scholar
Four participants were subjected to a perturbation during standing, a forward force impulse applied to their pelvis that forced them to step forward with the right leg for balance recovery.	Semantic Scholar
Trials with and without exoskeleton assistance to move the stepping legs thigh were conducted to investigate the influence of the exoskeletons control assistance on balancing performance and a potential adaptation.	Semantic Scholar
Analysis of the body kinematics and muscle activation demonstrates that robotic assistance: first, was easy to use and did not require learning, nor inhibited the healthy stepping behavior; second, it modified the stepping leg trajectories by increasing hip and knee movement; third, increased reaction speed and decreased the step duration; and finally, generally increased biceps femoris and rectus femoris muscle activity.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we introduce an analytic formulation for compressive binary classification.	Semantic Scholar
The formulation seeks to solve the least ℓp-norm of the parameter vector subject to a classification error constraint.	Semantic Scholar
An analytic and stretchable estimation is conjectured where the estimation can be viewed as an extension of the pseudoinverse with left and right constructions.	Semantic Scholar
Our variance analysis indicates that the estimation based on the left pseudoinverse is unbiased and the estimation based on the right pseudoinverse is biased.	Semantic Scholar
Sparseness can be obtained for the biased estimation under certain mild conditions.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed estimation is investigated numerically using both synthetic and real-world data.	Semantic Scholar
Transfer learning has been proven to be effective for the problems where training data from a source domain and test data from a target domain are drawn from different distributions.	Semantic Scholar
To reduce the distribution divergence between the source domain and the target domain, many previous studies have been focused on designing and optimizing objective functions with the Euclidean distance to measure dissimilarity between instances.	Semantic Scholar
However, in some real-world applications, the Euclidean distance may be inappropriate to capture the intrinsic similarity or dissimilarity between instances.	Semantic Scholar
To deal with this issue, in this paper, we propose a metric transfer learning framework (MTLF) to encode metric learning in transfer learning.	Semantic Scholar
In MTLF, instance weights are learned and exploited to bridge the distributions of different domains, while Mahalanobis distance is learned simultaneously to maximize the intra-class distances and minimize the inter-class distances for the target domain.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike previous work where instance weights and Mahalanobis distance are trained in a pipelined framework that potentially leads to error propagation across different components, MTLF attempts to learn instance weights and a Mahalanobis distance in a parallel framework to make knowledge transfer across domains more effective.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we develop general solutions to both classification and regression problems on top of MTLF, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
We conduct extensive experiments on several real-world datasets on object recognition, handwriting recognition, and WiFi location to verify the effectiveness of MTLF compared with a number of state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
Matching individuals across non-overlapping camera networks, known as person re-identification, is a fundamentally challenging problem due to the large visual appearance changes caused by variations of viewpoints, lighting, and occlusion.	Semantic Scholar
Approaches in literature can be categoried into two streams: The first stream is to develop reliable features against realistic conditions by combining several visual features in a pre-defined way; the second stream is to learn a metric from training data to ensure strong inter-class differences and intra-class similarities.	Semantic Scholar
However, seeking an optimal combination of visual features which is generic yet adaptive to different benchmarks is a unsoved problem, and metric learning models easily get over-fitted due to the scarcity of training data in person re-identification.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose two effective structured learning based approaches which explore the adaptive effects of visual features in recognizing persons in different benchmark data sets.	Semantic Scholar
Our framework is built on the basis of multiple low-level visual features with an optimal ensemble of their metrics.	Semantic Scholar
We formulate two optimization algorithms, CMC triplet and CMC top, which directly optimize evaluation measures commonly used in person re-identification, also known as the Cumulative Matching Characteristic (CMC) curve.	Semantic Scholar
The more standard CMC triplet formulation works on the triplet information by maximizing the relative distance beween a matched pair and a mismatched pair in each triplet unit.	Semantic Scholar
The CMC top formulation, modeled on a structured learning of maximizing the correct identification among top candidates, is demonstrated to be more beneficial to person re-identification by directly optimizing an objective closer to the actual testing criteria.	Semantic Scholar
The combination of these factors leads to a person re-identification system which outperforms most existing algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
More importantly, we advance state-of-the-art results by improving the rank-1 recognition rates from 40% to 61% on the iLIDS benchmark, 16% to 22% on the PRID2011 benchmark, 43% to 50% on the VIPeR benchmark, 34% to 55% on the CUHK01 benchmark and 21% to 68% on the CUHK03 benchmark.

The Nelson–Oppen combination method is ubiquitous in Satisfiability Modulo Theories solvers.	Semantic Scholar
However, one of its major drawbacks is to be restricted to disjoint unions of theories.	Semantic Scholar
We investigate the problem of extending this combination method to particular non-disjoint unions of theories defined by connecting disjoint theories via bridging functions.	Semantic Scholar
A possible application is to solve verification problems expressed in a combination of data structures connected to arithmetic with bridging functions such as the length of lists and the size of trees.	Semantic Scholar
We present a sound and complete combination method à la Nelson–Oppen for the theory of absolutely free data structures, including lists and trees.	Semantic Scholar
This combination procedure is then refined for standard interpretations.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting theory has a nice politeness property, enabling combinations with arbitrary decidable theories of elements.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we have identified a class of polite data structure theories for which the combination method remains sound and complete.	Semantic Scholar
This class includes all the subtheories of absolutely free data structures (e.g, the empty theory, injectivity, projection).	Semantic Scholar
Again, the politeness property holds for any theory in this class, which can thus be combined with bridging functions and arbitrary decidable theories of elements.	Semantic Scholar
This illustrates the significance of politeness in the context of non-disjoint combinations of theories.	Semantic Scholar
Search Based Software Engineering techniques are emerging as important tools for software maintenance.	Semantic Scholar
Foremost among these is Genetic Improvement, which has historically applied the stochastic techniques of Genetic Programming to optimize pre-existing program code.	Semantic Scholar

Semantic Scholar
Two case studies are described, both of which are applicable to the recently-introduced ‘grow and graft’ technique of Genetic Improvement: the first extends the expressiveness of the ‘grafting’ phase and the second transforms the representation of a list data type to yield an asymptotic efficiency improvement.

Workload management is the discipline of effectively monitoring, managing and controlling work flow across computing systems.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, workload management in database management systems (DBMSs) is the process or act of monitoring and controlling work (i.e., requests) executing on a database system in order to make efficient use of system resources in addition to achieving any performance objectives assigned to that work.

In the past decade, workload management studies and practice have made considerable progress in both academia and industry.	Semantic Scholar
New techniques have been proposed by researchers, and new features of workload management facilities have been implemented in most commercial database products.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we provide a systematic study of workload management in today's DBMSs by developing a taxonomy of workload management techniques.	Semantic Scholar
We apply the taxonomy to evaluate and classify existing workload management techniques implemented in the commercial databases and available in the recent research literature.	Semantic Scholar

The design of the shared-controller is based on measurements of distances to obstacles, angle differences, and the human input.	Semantic Scholar
The shared-controller is used to guarantee the safety of the car when the driver behaves “dangerously.” Formal properties of the closed-loop system with the shared-controller are presented through a Lyapunov-like analysis.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we consider uncertainties in the dynamics and prove that the shared-controller is able to help the driver drive the car safely even in the presence of disturbances.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the effectiveness of the controller is verified by two case studies: traffic at a junction and at a roundabout.	Semantic Scholar
We present a new approach to long-term mobile robot mapping in dynamic indoor environments.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike traditional world models that are tailored to represent static scenes, our approach explicitly models environmental dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
We assume that some of the hidden processes that influence the dynamic environment states are periodic and model the uncertainty of the estimated state variables by their frequency spectra.	Semantic Scholar
The spectral model can represent arbitrary timescales of environment dynamics with low memory requirements.	Semantic Scholar
Transformation of the spectral model to the time domain allows for the prediction of the future environment states, which improves the robot's long-term performance in changing environments.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments performed over time periods of months to years demonstrate that the approach can efficiently represent large numbers of observations and reliably predict future environment states.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments indicate that the model's predictive capabilities improve mobile robot localization and navigation in changing environments.	Semantic Scholar

The evaluation of the societal impact of autonomous technologies, particularly robotics, has grown in technological contexts (e.g., see [14] and the IEEE Global Initiative for Ethical Considerations in Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous Systems [20]), as well as broader political contexts (e.g., see the 2017 European Parliament report regarding civil law rules on robotics [21]).	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we adopt the perspective that conceptualizes new technologies as social experiments, stressing their experimental character to deal with the inherent uncertainty that affects their behavior.	Semantic Scholar
We suggest that the kind of experiments performed when evaluating robots in specific contexts of use are explorative experiments, i.e., investigations carried out in the absence of a proper theory or theoretical background that diverge from the traditional notion of controlled experiments.	Semantic Scholar
Considering this epistemological shift, we apply the ethical framework proposed by van de Poel for experimental technologies to the case of robotics, and we discuss its implications on the design of robots.	Semantic Scholar
To make our discussion more concrete, we reference the field of robots for search and rescue, which offers a challenging opportunity to test socioethical approaches to the development of robots and their interactions with environments and humans.	Semantic Scholar
Silicone-based bending soft pneumatic actuators (SPAs) have been very popular, since they provide solutions to many applications that require comfort and safety.	Semantic Scholar
However, their further utilization seems to be thwarted due to their limited force output.	Semantic Scholar
Force output can be the most important property for various SPAs, especially in assistive devices.	Semantic Scholar
Focusing on the SPA force application, this letter elaborates the yielding and buckling issues of the bending SPAs and introduces a novel perspective toward the understanding of these issues.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we proposed a revised force measurement method and tested the force outputs of the newly designed bending SPAs of different materials and lengths.	Semantic Scholar
The results showed that the material and length are among the key factors that influence the instability occurrence.	Semantic Scholar
This letter, as our initial step toward the development of instability theory of different SPAs, can help the soft robot engineers to design force-robust soft actuators for different applications.	Semantic Scholar

In this letter, we present a general approach to automatically visual servo control the position and shape of a deformable object whose deformation parameters are unknown.	Semantic Scholar
The servo control is achieved by online learning a model mapping between the robotic end-effector's movement and the object's deformation measurement.	Semantic Scholar
The model is learned using the Gaussian process regression (GPR) to deal with its highly nonlinear property, and once learned, the model is used for predicting the required control at each time step.	Semantic Scholar
To overcome GPR's high computational cost while dealing with long manipulation sequences, we implement a fast online GPR by selectively removing uninformative observation data from the regression process.	Semantic Scholar
We validate the performance of our controller on a set of deformable object manipulation tasks and demonstrate that our method can achieve effective and accurate servo control for general deformable objects with a wide variety of goal settings.	Semantic Scholar

This study, which examines a calculation method on the basis of a dual neural network for solving multiple definite integrals, addresses the problems of inefficiency, inaccuracy, and difficulty in finding solutions.	Semantic Scholar
First, the method offers a dual neural network method to construct a primitive function of the integral problem; it can approximate the primitive function of any given integrand with any precision.	Semantic Scholar
On this basis, a neural network calculation method that can solve multiple definite integrals whose upper and lower bounds are arbitrarily given is obtained with repeated applications of the dual neural network to construction of the primitive function.	Semantic Scholar
Example simulations indicate that compared with traditional methods, the proposed algorithm is more efficient and precise in obtaining solutions for multiple integrals with unknown integrand, except for the finite input-output data points.	Semantic Scholar
The advantages of the proposed method include the following: (1) integral multiplicity shows no influence and restriction on the employment of the method; (2) only a finite set of known sample points is required without the need to know the exact analytical expression of the integrand; and (3) high calculation accuracy is obtained for multiple definite integrals whose integrand is expressed by sample data points.

This letter proposes a novel predictive coding type neural network model, the predictive multiple spatiotemporal scales recurrent neural network (P-MSTRNN).	Semantic Scholar
The P-MSTRNN learns to predict visually perceived human whole-body cyclic movement patterns by exploiting multiscale spatiotemporal constraints imposed on network dynamics by using differently sized receptive fields as well as different time constant values for each layer.	Semantic Scholar
After learning, the network can imitate target movement patterns by inferring or recognizing corresponding intentions by means of the regression of prediction error.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that the network can develop a functional hierarchy by developing a different type of dynamic structure at each layer.	Semantic Scholar
The letter examines how model performance during pattern generation, as well as predictive imitation, varies depending on the stage of learning.	Semantic Scholar
The number of limit cycle attractors corresponding to target movement patterns increases as learning proceeds.	Semantic Scholar
Transient dynamics developing early in the learning process successfully perform pattern generation and predictive imitation tasks.	Semantic Scholar
The letter concludes that exploitation of transient dynamics facilitates successful task performance during early learning periods.	Semantic Scholar
Nowadays, machine learning is becoming a new paradigm for mining hidden knowledge in big data.	Semantic Scholar
The collection and manipulation of big data not only create considerable values, but also raise serious privacy concerns.	Semantic Scholar
To protect the huge amount of potentially sensitive data, a straightforward approach is to encrypt data with specialized cryptographic tools.	Semantic Scholar
However, it is challenging to utilize or operate on encrypted data, especially to perform machine learning algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we investigate the problem of training high quality word vectors over large-scale encrypted data (from distributed data owners) with the privacy-preserving collaborative neural network learning algorithms.	Semantic Scholar

Roboticists aim to segment robot actions into a sequence of motion primitives to simplify the robot programming phase.	Semantic Scholar
Choreographers aim to capture the essence of human body movements within a sequence of symbols that can be understood by dancers.	Semantic Scholar
To that extent, roboticists and choreographers pursue the same quest.	Semantic Scholar
We have undertaken a pluridisciplinary approach, combining a dance notation system (the Kinetography Laban system) with a robot programming system [the Stack of Task (SoT)].	Semantic Scholar
Motion scores are used instead of quantitative data to compare and enlighten differences in robot and human movements.	Semantic Scholar
We then discuss plausible origins of these differences, taking into account the implicit rules of the Kinetography Laban system on how a movement is executed by humans.	Semantic Scholar

The explosive growth in popularity of social networking leads to the problematic usage.	Semantic Scholar
An increasing number of social network mental disorders (SNMDs), such as Cyber-Relationship Addiction, Information Overload, and Net Compulsion, have been recently noted.	Semantic Scholar
Symptoms of these mental disorders are usually observed passively today, resulting in delayed clinical intervention.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we argue that mining online social behavior provides an opportunity to actively identify SNMDs at an early stage.	Semantic Scholar
It is challenging to detect SNMDs because the mental status cannot be directly observed from online social activity logs.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach, new and innovative to the practice of SNMD detection, does not rely on self-revealing of those mental factors via questionnaires in Psychology.	Semantic Scholar
Instead, we propose a machine learning framework, namely, Social Network Mental Disorder Detection (SNMDD), that exploits features extracted from social network data to accurately identify potential cases of SNMDs.	Semantic Scholar
We also exploit multi-source learning in SNMDD and propose a new SNMD-based Tensor Model (STM) to improve the accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
To increase the scalability of STM, we further improve the efficiency with performance guarantee.	Semantic Scholar
Our framework is evaluated via a user study with 3,126 online social network users.	Semantic Scholar
We conduct a feature analysis, and also apply SNMDD on large-scale datasets and analyze the characteristics of the three SNMD types.	Semantic Scholar
The results manifest that SNMDD is promising for identifying online social network users with potential SNMDs.	Semantic Scholar
Humanoid robots are expected to be integrated into daily life.	Semantic Scholar
This requires the robots to perform humanlike actions that are easily understandable byhumans.	Semantic Scholar
Learning by imitation is an effective framework that enables the robots to generate the same motions that humans do.	Semantic Scholar
However, it is generally not useful for the robots to generate motions that are precisely the same as learned motions because the environment is likely to be different from the environment where the motions were learned.	Semantic Scholar
The humanoid robot should synthesize motions that are adaptive to the current environment by modifying learned motions.	Semantic Scholar
Previous research encoded captured human whole-body motions into hidden Markov models, which are hereafter referred to as motion primitives, and generated human-like motions based on the acquired motion primitives.	Semantic Scholar
The contact between the body and the environment also needs to be controlled, so that the humanoid robot’s whole-bodymotion can be realized in its current environment.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a novel approach to synthesizing kinematic data using the motion primitive and controlling the torques of all the joints in the humanoid robot to achieve the desired whole-bodymotions and contact forces.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach to synthesizing and controlling wholebody motions by humanoid robots.	Semantic Scholar

Text classification is a process of classifying documents into predefined categories through different classifiers learned from labelled or unlabelled training samples.	Semantic Scholar
Many researchers who work on binary text classification attempt to find a more effective way to separate relevant texts from a large data set.	Semantic Scholar
However, current text classifiers cannot unambiguously describe the decision boundary between positive and negative objects because of uncertainties caused by text feature selection and the knowledge learning process.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a three-way decision model for dealing with the uncertain boundary to improve the binary text classification performance based on the <italic> rough set</italic> techniques and centroid solution.	Semantic Scholar

Series elastic actuators (SEAs) have become fundamental components in robots that physically interact with unstructured environments and humans.	Semantic Scholar
Force control of SEAs is indeed an active area of research.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a theoretical foundation for acceleration feedback (AF) in SEA force control.	Semantic Scholar
Even if AF already appeared in early works on SEAs, its advantages have not been properly highlighted in the literature.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, this paper formally motivates improved performance robustness and transparency exactly as if using a softer and lighter actuator.	Semantic Scholar
Taking advantage of AF, we propose a generic control architecture characterized by impressive performance robustness in spite of even high environment uncertainties.	Semantic Scholar
A comparison with state-of-the-art force control solutions such as disturbance observers and adaptive controllers is reported using a comprehensive set of simulations and experiments.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, AF methods exhibit the higher performance robustness and accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
Beside this outcome, AF controllers are extremely easy to implement and the rise of low-cost miniaturized accelerometers based on micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) represents an additional motivations for their use.	Semantic Scholar

The proof is split into an algorithm proof and an implementation proof.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm proof follows the structure of the informal intuition for the generational collector’s correctness, namely, a partial collection cycle in a generational collector is the same as running a full collection on part of the heap, if one views pointers to old data as non-pointers.

Diagnosis of a specific learning disability such as dysgraphia impacts children's academic progress and well-being.	Semantic Scholar
Dysgraphia is diagnosed by clinicians based on children's written product and educational staff's impressions.	Semantic Scholar
This process is time consuming and subjective.	Semantic Scholar
Consequently, many children with mild dysgraphia remain undiagnosed, especially those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, a method for automatic identification and characterization of dysgraphia in third-grade children is described.	Semantic Scholar
The method is based on analyzing the child's writing dynamics by sampling the pressure the pen exerts on the paper as well as the pen's position and orientation by using a standard digital writing pad.	Semantic Scholar
Ninety-nine samples were collected from writers with dysgraphia and proficient writers.	Semantic Scholar
A wide range of features covering dynamic properties of the writing and typographic (i.e., visual) properties were extracted for each participant.	Semantic Scholar
Machine learning methodologies were used to infer a statistical model, which is capable of discriminating dysgraphic products from proficient products with approximately 90% accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
The model was analyzed to conclude which handwriting features are most discriminative.	Semantic Scholar
Since the model provides 90% sensitivity for a specificity of 90%, it is the first step toward future use as an effective standard indicator for dysgraphia detection.	Semantic Scholar
Robust state estimation is the core capability for autonomous aerial robots operating in complex environments.	Semantic Scholar
Global navigation satellite system and visual odometry/SLAM are popular methods for state estimation.	Semantic Scholar
However, there exist scenarios, such as when flying between tall buildings or in the middle of deep canyons, that all these methods fail due to obstructed sky view and high altitude.	Semantic Scholar
in this letter, inspired by the fact that offline-generated three-dimensional (3-D) models of cities and natural scenes are readily available, we propose a global localization method for aerial robots by using 3-D models and measurements from a monocular fisheye camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU).	Semantic Scholar
Due to the fact that 3-D models are generated by different cameras at different times, traditional feature-based or direct registration methods usually fail to perform, we therefore propose to use an edge alignment-based method for image-to-model registration under strong changes in lighting conditions and camera characteristics.	Semantic Scholar
We additionally aid our model-based localization with electronic image stabilization for better tracking performance, and extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based sensor fusion for closed-loop control.	Semantic Scholar

The proposed distance-consistent LLE can promise that edges between closer data points are heavier.	Semantic Scholar
We also propose a novel improved spectral clustering via embedded label propagation.	Semantic Scholar

First is label propagation, which propagates a node's labels to neighboring nodes according to their proximity.	Semantic Scholar
We perform standard spectral clustering on original data and assign each cluster with -nearest data points and then we propagate labels through dense unlabeled data regions.	Semantic Scholar
Second is manifold learning, which has been widely used for its capacity to leverage the manifold structure of data points.	Semantic Scholar

A vast majority of computation in the brain is performed by spiking neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
Despite the ubiquity of such spiking, we currently lack an understanding of how biological spiking neural circuits learn and compute in vivo, as well as how we can instantiate such capabilities in artificial spiking circuits in silico.	Semantic Scholar
Here we revisit the problem of supervised learning in temporally coding multilayer spiking neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
First, by using a surrogate gradient approach, we derive SuperSpike, a nonlinear voltage-based three-factor learning rule capable of training multilayer networks of deterministic integrate-and-fire neurons to perform nonlinear computations on spatiotemporal spike patterns.	Semantic Scholar
Second, inspired by recent results on feedback alignment, we compare the performance of our learning rule under different credit assignment strategies for propagating output errors to hidden units.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we test uniform, symmetric, and random feedback, finding that simpler tasks can be solved with any type of feedback, while more complex tasks require symmetric feedback.	Semantic Scholar

In this paper, we investigate and model the motion behaviors in the atmosphere and vacuum of the landing gear of a lunar probe, which contacts the granular material covering the lunar surface.	Semantic Scholar
Drop and friction tests were conducted using the footpads of a lander on a lunar regolith simulant.	Semantic Scholar
In the drop tests, the footpads were dropped onto the simulant.	Semantic Scholar
The impact characteristics of the footpads were then analyzed.	Semantic Scholar
In the friction tests, footpads having varying shapes were slid onto the simulant.	Semantic Scholar
The sliding characteristics of the footpads were then evaluated.	Semantic Scholar
The drop tests showed that the simulant ejected by the footpad impact diminished, and the footpad penetration significantly decreased in the vacuum.	Semantic Scholar
The friction tests confirmed that the sinkage caused by the sliding of the footpad generally increased more in the vacuum than in the atmosphere.	Semantic Scholar
However, the difference in the sinkages can be negligible depending on the footpad shape.	Semantic Scholar
These findings enabled the deriving of fundamental models of landing gear and suggested guidelines for the design and development of landing gear.	Semantic Scholar
In line with the sensorimotor contingency theory, we investigate the problem of the perception of space from a fundamental sensorimotor perspective.	Semantic Scholar
Despite its pervasive nature in our perception of the world, the origin of the concept of space remains largely mysterious.	Semantic Scholar
For example in the context of artificial perception, this issue is usually circumvented by having engineers pre-define the spatial structure of the problem the agent has to face.	Semantic Scholar
We here show that the structure of space can be autonomously discovered by a naive agent in the form of sensorimotor regularities, that correspond to so called compensable sensory experiences: these are experiences that can be generated either by the agent or its environment.	Semantic Scholar
By detecting such compensable experiences the agent can infer the topological and metric structure of the external space in which its body is moving.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a theoretical description of the nature of these regularities and illustrate the approach on a simulated robotic arm equipped with an eye-like sensor, and which interacts with an object.	Semantic Scholar
Finally we show how these regularities can be used to build an internal representation of the sensor's external spatial configuration.	Semantic Scholar
We present a three-dimensional deep convolutional neural network (3D CNN) approach for grasping unknown objects with soft hands.	Semantic Scholar
Soft hands are compliant and capable of handling uncertainty in sensing and actuation, but come at the cost of unpredictable deformation of the soft fingers.	Semantic Scholar
Traditional model-driven grasping approaches, which assume known models for objects, robot hands, and stable grasps with expected contacts, are inapplicable to such soft hands, since predicting contact points between objects and soft hands is not straightforward.	Semantic Scholar
Our solution adopts a deep CNN approach to find good caging grasps for previously unseen objects by learning effective features and a classifier from point cloud data.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike recent CNN models applied to robotic grasping which have been trained on 2D or 2.5D images and limited to a fixed top grasping direction, we exploit the power of a 3D CNN model to estimate suitable grasp poses from multiple grasping directions (top and side directions) and wrist orientations, which has great potential for geometry-related robotic tasks.

Due to the parameter mismatches, lag complete synchronization in general cannot be achieved.	Semantic Scholar
First, based on the -measure method, generalized Halanay inequality, together with control algorithms, some sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure that coupled memristor-based neural networks are in a state of lag synchronization with an error.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the error level is estimated.	Semantic Scholar
Second, we show that memristor-based coupled neural networks with parameter mismatches can reach lag complete synchronization under a discontinuous controller.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, two examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed criteria and well support theoretical results.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a novel approach for efficient sampling of Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) based upon learning a state-action value function (Q-function).	Semantic Scholar
Our sampling method selects the optimal node to extend in the search tree via the learned state value computed from the node feature representation.	Semantic Scholar
Our softmax node selection procedure avoids becoming stuck at local minima and maintains the asymptotic completeness property of RRTs.	Semantic Scholar
We employ several features in learning the Q-function, including radial basis function (RBF) scoring of collision and collision-free regions in the configuration space.	Semantic Scholar
Since this approach allows the RRT to explore efficiently while avoiding obstacles via the Q-function, the RRT planner is continually adapted to the surrounding environment in an online manner.	Semantic Scholar

This Special Issue on Autonomous Driving and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADDAS) published by the Robotics and Autonomous Systems Journal contains extended versions of a set of selected papers from a special session on the same topic, which took place in the framework of the Second Iberian Robotics Conference, November 19th–21st 2015, in Lisbon, Portugal.	Semantic Scholar
The papers included in this special issue address several subjects of relevance to the ADDAS community, from scene representations using multi-modal data to infrared imaging or multiple sensor calibration algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
From the papers accepted for publication, two or three main interest lineswere observed, which could be interpreted as current dominant trends for this community.	Semantic Scholar
They cover mainly 3D perception, multimodal sensors and sensor fusion.	Semantic Scholar
The importance of 3D perception is now undeniable in the ADDAS context, be it using lidar or stereo based sensors.	Semantic Scholar
As such, several papers in this special issue address the problem in several fronts, ranging from the automatic calibration in lidar and cameras multisensorial setups (Pereira et al.	Semantic Scholar
), up to efficient modelling and detection of features for navigation, namely on the ground, as shown both in 3D lidar approaches (Asvadi et al.)	Semantic Scholar
and stereo approaches (de la Escalera et al.).	Semantic Scholar
The ultimate challenge in processing 3D data is naturally environment and scene reconstruction, and theworks by (Oliveira et al.)	Semantic Scholar
include relevant contributions in that field as well.	Semantic Scholar
Multimodality also appears as a relevant issue, and it is no longer uncommon to see on the same setups crossed combinations of lidar, vision, infrared and even radar; this richness of exteroceptive modality naturally implies the need for sensorial calibration and the subsequent data fusion procedures.	Semantic Scholar
The selected papers include contributions on the following topics: Evaluations on the usage of images resulting from the fusion of cross-spectral inputs, applied to the monocular visual odometry estimation, have been reported (Sappa et al.	Semantic Scholar
); such a fused image based approach has shown advantages when compared with the state of the art.	Semantic Scholar
Human memory is capable of retrieving similar memories to a just retrieved one.	Semantic Scholar
This associative ability is at the base of our everyday processing of information.	Semantic Scholar
Current models of memory have not been able to underpin the mechanism that the brain could use in order to actively exploit similarities between memories.	Semantic Scholar
The current idea is that to induce transitions in attractor neural networks, it is necessary to extinguish the current memory.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce a novel mechanism capable of inducing transitions between memories where similarities between memories are actively exploited by the neural dynamics to retrieve a new memory.	Semantic Scholar
Populations of neurons that are selective for multiple memories play a crucial role in this mechanism by becoming attractors on their own.	Semantic Scholar
The mechanism is based on the ability of the neural network to control the excitation-inhibition balance.	Semantic Scholar

State of the art approaches for visual-inertial sensor fusion use filter-based or optimization-based algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the nonlinearity of the system, a poor initialization can have a dramatic impact on the performance of these estimation methods.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, a closed-form solution providing such an initialization was derived in [1].	Semantic Scholar
That solution determines the velocity (angular and linear) of a monocular camera in metric units by only using inertial measurements and image features acquired in a short time interval.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we study the impact of noisy sensors on the performance of this closed-form solution.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the gyroscope bias, not accounted for in [1], significantly affects the performance of the method.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we introduce a new method to automatically estimate this bias.	Semantic Scholar
Compared to the original method, the new approach now models the gyroscope bias and is robust to it.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of the proposed approach is successfully demonstrated on real data from a quadrotor MAV.	Semantic Scholar
Foreground segmentation is a key stage in multiple computer vision applications, where existing algorithms are commonly evaluated making use of ground-truth data.	Semantic Scholar
Reference-free or stand-alone evaluations that estimate segmented foreground quality are an alternative methodology to overcome the limitations inherent to ground-truth based evaluations.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we survey and explore existing stand-alone measures proposed in related research areas to determine good object properties for estimating the segmentation quality in background subtraction algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a new taxonomy for stand-alone evaluation measures and analyze 21 proposals.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the utility of the selected measures to evaluate the segmentation masks of eight background subtraction algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments are performed over a large heterogeneous dataset with varied challenges (CDNET2014) and identify which properties of the measures are the most effective to estimate quality.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments also demonstrate that qualitative performance levels can be distinguished and background subtraction algorithms can be ranked without the need of ground-truth.	Semantic Scholar

In this paper, we propose a distributed version of the Hungarian method to solve the well-known assignment problem.	Semantic Scholar
In the context of multirobot applications, all robots cooperatively compute a common assignment that optimizes a given global criterion (e.g., the total distance traveled) within a finite set of local computations and communications over a peer-to-peer network.	Semantic Scholar
As a motivating application, we consider a class of multirobot routing problems with “spatiotemporal” constraints, i.e., spatial targets that require servicing at particular time instants.	Semantic Scholar
As a means of demonstrating the theory developed in this paper, the robots cooperatively find online suboptimal routes by applying an iterative version of the proposed algorithm in a distributed and dynamic setting.	Semantic Scholar
As a concrete experimental test bed, we provide an interactive “multirobot orchestral” framework, in which a team of robots cooperatively plays a piece of music on a so-called orchestral floor.	Semantic Scholar
This letter investigates how mobile agents with qualitatively different sensing capabilities should be organized in order to effectively cover an area.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, by encoding the different capabilities as different density functions in the locational cost, the result is a heterogeneous coverage control problem where the different density functions serve as a way of both abstracting and encapsulating different sensing capabilities.	Semantic Scholar
However, different density functions imply that mass is not conserved as the agents move and, as a result, the normal cancellations that occur across boundaries between regions of dominance in the homogeneous case no longer take place when computing the gradient of the locational cost.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, new terms are needed if the robots are to execute a descent flow in order to minimize the locational cost, and we show how these additional terms can be formulated as boundary-disagreement terms that are added to the standard Lloyd's algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The results are implemented on real robotic platforms for a number of different use cases.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a novel integrated approach for efficient optimization based online trajectory planning of topologically distinctive mobile robot trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
Online trajectory optimization deforms an initial coarse path generated by a global planner by minimizing objectives such as path length, transition time or control effort.	Semantic Scholar
Kinodynamic motion properties of mobile robots and clearance from obstacles impose additional equality and inequality constraints on the trajectory optimization.	Semantic Scholar
Local planners account for efficiency by restricting the search space to locally optimal solutions only.	Semantic Scholar
However, the objective function is usually non-convex as the presence of obstacles generates multiple distinctive local optima.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method maintains and simultaneously optimizes a subset of admissible candidate trajectories of distinctive topologies and thus seeking the overall best candidate among the set of alternative local solutions.	Semantic Scholar
Time-optimal trajectories for differential-drive and carlike robots are obtained efficiently by adopting the Timed-Elastic-Band approach for the underlying trajectory optimization problem.	Semantic Scholar
The investigation of various example scenarios and a comparative analysis with conventional local planners confirm the advantages of integrated exploration, maintenance and optimization of topologically distinctive trajectories.	Semantic Scholar

In this letter, we propose a constrained optimization formulation and a robust incremental framework for the simultaneous localization and mapping problem (SLAM).	Semantic Scholar
The new SLAM formulation is derived from the nonlinear least squares (NLS) formulation by mathematically formulating loop-closure cycles as constraints.	Semantic Scholar
Under the constrained SLAM formulation, we study the robustness of an incremental SLAM algorithm against local minima and outliers as a constraint/loop-closure cycle selection problem.	Semantic Scholar
We find a constraint metric that can predict the objective function growth after including the constraint.	Semantic Scholar
By the virtue of the constraint metric, we select constraints into the incremental SLAM according to a least objective function growth principle to increase robustness against local minima and perform $\chi ^2$ difference test on the constraint metric to increase robustness against outliers.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, using sequential quadratic programming (SQP) as the solver, an incremental SLAM algorithm (iSQP) is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental validations are provided to illustrate the accuracy of the constraint metric and the robustness of the proposed incremental SLAM algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Nonetheless, the proposed approach is currently confined to datasets with sparse loop-closures due to its computational cost.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, the authors proposed a new wrist exoskeleton designed to provide kinesthetic feedback to the wrist user's joints for rehabilitative, teleoperation, and virtual environment interaction purposes.	Semantic Scholar
The design process focused on the need to use the interface as the end-effector of a whole bimanual upper limb exoskeleton system, composed of two exoskeleton arms with 7 DoF each and two hand exoskeletons for all the fingers.	Semantic Scholar
The guideline of the design pointed to reach a tradeoff between high transparency and low weight.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, both the compactness and mass distribution have played an important role in the design process due to the need to perform bimanual task and interaction.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed device was designed adopting a tendon-cable transmission for all the three joints.	Semantic Scholar
A differential transmission solution has been adopted to actuate the flexion/extension and radial/ulnar deviation joints, which allows to achieve lower inertia and higher compactness than a serial transmission.	Semantic Scholar
A first prototype has been build and characterized with several experimental tests showing its suitability for both teleoperation and rehabilitative therapy.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the wrist device has been integrated with both the arm and the hand exoskeleton to prove the requirement observance.	Semantic Scholar
Semantic drift is a common problem in iterative information extraction.	Semantic Scholar
Previous approaches for minimizing semantic drift may incur substantial loss in recall.	Semantic Scholar
We observe that most semantic drifts are introduced by a small number of questionable extractions in the earlier rounds of iterations.	Semantic Scholar
These extractions subsequently introduce a large number of questionable results, which lead to the semantic drift phenomenon.	Semantic Scholar
We call these questionable extractions Drifting Points (DPs).	Semantic Scholar
If erroneous extractions are the “symptoms” of semantic drift, then DPs are the “causes” of semantic drift.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a method to minimize semantic drift by identifying the DPs and removing the effect introduced by the DPs.	Semantic Scholar
We use isA (concept-instance) extraction as an example to describe our approach in cleaning information extraction errors caused by semantic drift, but we perform experiments on different relation extraction processes on three large real data extraction collections.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results show that our DP cleaning method enables us to clean around 90 percent incorrect instances or patterns with about 90 percent precision, which outperforms the previous approaches we compare with.	Semantic Scholar
The planning and execution of real-world robotic tasks largely depends on the ability to generate feasible motions online in response to changing environment conditions or goals.	Semantic Scholar
A spline deformation method is able to modify a given trajectory so that it matches the new boundary conditions, e.g., on positions, velocities, accelerations, etc.	Semantic Scholar
At the same time, the deformed motion preserves velocity, acceleration, jerk, or higher derivatives of motion profile of the precalculated trajectory.	Semantic Scholar
The deformed motion possessing such properties can be expressed by translation of original trajectory and spline interpolation.	Semantic Scholar
This spline decomposition considerably reduces the computational complexity and allows real-time execution.	Semantic Scholar
Formal feasibility guarantees are provided for the deformed trajectory and for the resulting torques.	Semantic Scholar
These guarantees are based on the special properties of Bernstein polynomials used for the deformation and on the structure of the chosen computed-torque control scheme.	Semantic Scholar
The approach is experimentally evaluated in a number of planar volleyball experiments using 3 degree-of-freedom robots and human participants.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a physical human–robot interaction scenario in which a robot guides and performs the role of a teacher within a defined dance training framework.	Semantic Scholar
A combined cognitive and physical feedback of performance is proposed for assisting the skill learning process.	Semantic Scholar
Direct contact cooperation has been designed through an adaptive impedance-based controller that adjusts according to the partner's performance in the task.	Semantic Scholar
In measuring performance, a scoring system has been designed using the concept of progressive teaching (PT).	Semantic Scholar
The system adjusts the difficulty based on the user's number of practices and performance history.	Semantic Scholar
Using the proposed method and a baseline constant con-troller, comparative experiments have shown that the PT presents better performance in the initial stage of skill learning.	Semantic Scholar
An analysis of the subjects’ perception of comfort, peace of mind, and robot performance has shown significant difference at the $p< 0.01$  level, favoring the PT algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Deformable image registration is a fundamental problem in computer vision and medical image computing.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we investigate the use of graphical models in the context of a particular type of image registration problem, known as slice-to-volume registration.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce a scalable, modular and flexible formulation that can accommodate low-rank and high order terms, that simultaneously selects the plane and estimates the in-plane deformation through a single shot optimization approach.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed framework is instantiated into different variants seeking either a compromise between computational efficiency (soft plane selection constraints and approximate definition of the data similarity terms through pair-wise components) or exact definition of the data terms and the constraints on the plane selection.	Semantic Scholar
Simulated and real-data in the context of ultrasound and magnetic resonance registration (where both framework instantiations as well as different optimization strategies are considered) demonstrate the potentials of our method.	Semantic Scholar
One of the critical aspects in the design of an assistive wearable robot is the energy efficiency of the actuation system, since it significantly affects the weight and consequently the comfort of the system.	Semantic Scholar
Several strategies have been used in previous research, mostly based on energy harvesting, compliant elements for mechanical energy accumulation (springs or elastic cords), ratchets, and clutches.	Semantic Scholar
However, the design of the optimal actuator arrangement is highly dependent on the task, which increases significantly the complexity of the design process.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present an energy efficiency analysis and design optimization of an actuation system applied to a soft module lower limb exoskeleton.	Semantic Scholar
Instead of performing a comparison between predefined mechanism arrangements, we solve a full optimization problem that includes not only the mechanism parameters, but also the mechanism architecture itself.	Semantic Scholar
The optimization is performed for a walking task using gait data from a stroke subject, and the result is a set of actuator arrangements with optimal parameters for the analyzed task and selected user.	Semantic Scholar
The optimized mechanism is able to reduce the energy requirements by 20–65%, depending on the joint.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed mechanism is currently under development within the XoSoft EU project, a modular soft lower-limb exoskeleton to assist people with mobility impairments.	Semantic Scholar
This letter studies the multistability analysis of delayed recurrent neural networks with Mexican hat activation function.	Semantic Scholar
Some sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure that an -dimensional recurrent neural network can have equilibrium points with , and of them are locally exponentially stable.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the attraction basins of these stable equilibrium points are estimated.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the attraction basins of these stable equilibrium points can be larger than their originally partitioned subsets.	Semantic Scholar
The results of this letter improve and extend the existing stability results in the literature.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, a numerical example containing different cases is given to illustrate the theoretical results.	Semantic Scholar

Traditional place categorization approaches in robot vision assume that training and test images have similar visual appearance.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, any seasonal, illumination, and environmental changes typically lead to severe degradation in performance.	Semantic Scholar
To cope with this problem, recent works have been proposed to adopt domain adaptation techniques.	Semantic Scholar
While effective, these methods assume that some prior information about the scenario where the robot will operate is available at training time.	Semantic Scholar
Unfortunately, in many cases, this assumption does not hold, as we often do not know where a robot will be deployed.	Semantic Scholar
To overcome this issue, in this paper, we present an approach that aims at learning classification models able to generalize to unseen scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we propose a novel deep learning framework for domain generalization.	Semantic Scholar
Our method develops from the intuition that, given a set of different classification models associated to known domains (e.g., corresponding to multiple environments, robots), the best model for a new sample in the novel domain can be computed directly at test time by optimally combining the known models.	Semantic Scholar
To implement our idea, we exploit recent advances in deep domain adaptation and design a convolutional neural network architecture with novel layers performing a weighted version of batch normalization.	Semantic Scholar
Our experiments, conducted on three common datasets for robot place categorization, confirm the validity of our contribution.	Semantic Scholar
Stochastic memristor-based bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks with time delays play an increasingly important role in the design and implementation of neural network systems.	Semantic Scholar
Under the framework of Filippov solutions, the issues of the pth moment exponential stability of stochastic memristor-based BAM neural networks are investigated.	Semantic Scholar
By using the stochastic stability theory, Itô's differential formula and Young inequality, the criteria are derived.	Semantic Scholar
Meanwhile, with Lyapunov approach and Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we derive some sufficient conditions for the mean square exponential stability of the above systems.	Semantic Scholar
The obtained results improve and extend previous works on memristor-based or usual neural networks dynamical systems.	Semantic Scholar
Four numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.	Semantic Scholar
This letter deals with recursive filtering for dynamic systems where an explicit process model is not easily devisable.	Semantic Scholar
Most Bayesian filters assume the availability of such an explicit process model, and thus may require additional assumptions or fail to properly leverage all available information.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast, we propose a filter that employs a purely residual-based modeling of the available information and thus achieves higher modeling flexibility.	Semantic Scholar
While this letter is related to the descriptor Kalman filter, it also represents a step toward batch optimization and allows the integration of further techniques, such as robust weighting for outlier rejection.	Semantic Scholar
We derive recursive filter equations that exhibit similar computational complexity when compared to their Kalman filter counterpart—the extended information filter.	Semantic Scholar
The applicability of the proposed approach is experimentally confirmed on two different real mobile robotic state estimation problems.	Semantic Scholar
Robust estimation of correspondences between image pixels is an important problem in robotics, with applications in tracking, mapping, and recognition of objects, environments, and other agents.	Semantic Scholar
Correspondence estimation has long been the domain of hand-engineered features, but more recently deep learning techniques have provided powerful tools for learning features from raw data.	Semantic Scholar
The drawback of the latter approach is that a vast amount of (labeled, typically) training data are required for learning.	Semantic Scholar
This paper advocates a new approach to learning visual descriptors for dense correspondence estimation in which we harness the power of a strong three-dimensional generative model to automatically label correspondences in RGB-D video data.	Semantic Scholar
A fully convolutional network is trained using a contrastive loss to produce viewpoint- and lighting-invariant descriptors.	Semantic Scholar
As a proof of concept, we collected two datasets: The first depicts the upper torso and head of the same person in widely varied settings, and the second depicts an office as seen on multiple days with objects rearranged within.	Semantic Scholar
Our datasets focus on revisitation of the same objects and environments, and we show that by training the CNN only from local tracking data, our learned visual descriptor generalizes toward identifying nonlabeled correspondences across videos.	Semantic Scholar
We furthermore show that our approach to descriptor learning can be used to achieve state-of-the-art single-frame localization results on the MSR 7-scenes dataset without using any labels identifying correspondences between separate videos of the same scenes at training time.	Semantic Scholar
The ability to steer a needle around delicate or bony structures during needle insertion for targeting tumors is promising from the viewpoint of improving the effectiveness of needle insertion.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, a novel flexible mechanism called “Active Sheath” is proposed for realizing shape-controllable cannulas by using only two flexible elements.	Semantic Scholar
Then, a steerable needle with an outer diameter of 1.3 mm and a conical tip is presented based on the proposed mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, a robotic manipulator is presented to control the proposed needle precisely to the right and left by using only one translational joint.	Semantic Scholar
Based on numerical simulations of Active Sheath using the finite-element method, a dual parallel curve model with constant curvature is developed to describe the Active Sheath system.	Semantic Scholar
In the experiments, the curving response of the needle to the various inputs is assessed and the results are compared with those obtained using the kinematic model.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the shapes of the controlled needles inserted into an agar phantom are investigated and compared with those of a stainless steel bevel-tip needle and a beta-titanium flexible bevel-tip needle.	Semantic Scholar
The prototype steerable needle with a conical tip can bend a lateral distance of approximately 91% of that of the beta-titanium flexible bevel-tip needle in 100-mm insertion trials.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed flexible mechanism and the steerable needle prototype have the potential to create curved paths through shape-control commands during needle insertion.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we introduce a novel category of double fuzzy clustering-driven context neural networks (DFCCNNs).	Semantic Scholar
The study is focused on the development of advanced design methodologies for redesigning the structure of conventional fuzzy clustering-based neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
The conventional fuzzy clustering-based neural networks typically focus on dividing the input space into several local spaces (implied by clusters).	Semantic Scholar
In contrast, the proposed DFCCNNs take into account two distinct local spaces called context and cluster spaces, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
Cluster space refers to the local space positioned in the input space whereas context space concerns a local space formed in the output space.	Semantic Scholar
Through partitioning the output space into several local spaces, each context space is used as the desired (target) local output to construct local models.	Semantic Scholar
To complete this, the proposed network includes a new context layer for reasoning about context space in the output space.	Semantic Scholar
In this sense, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering is useful to form local spaces in both input and output spaces.	Semantic Scholar
The first one is used in order to form clusters and train weights positioned between the input and hidden layer, whereas the other one is applied to the output space to form context spaces.	Semantic Scholar
The key features of the proposed DFCCNNs can be enumerated as follows: (i) the parameters between the input layer and hidden layer are built through FCM clustering.	Semantic Scholar
The connections (weights) are specified as constant terms being in fact the centers of the clusters.	Semantic Scholar
"The membership functions (represented through the partition matrix) produced by the FCM are used as activation functions located at the hidden layer of the ""conventional"" neural networks."	Semantic Scholar
(ii) Following the hidden layer, a context layer is formed to approximate the context space of the output variable and each node in context layer means individual local model.	Semantic Scholar
The outputs of the context layer are specified as a combination of both weights formed as linear function and the outputs of the hidden layer.	Semantic Scholar
The weights are updated using the least square estimation (LSE)-based method.	Semantic Scholar
(iii) At the output layer, the outputs of context layer are decoded to produce the corresponding numeric output.	Semantic Scholar
At this time, the weighted average is used and the weights are also adjusted with the use of the LSE scheme.	Semantic Scholar
From the viewpoint of performance improvement, the proposed design methodologies are discussed and experimented with the aid of benchmark machine learning datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Through the experiments, it is shown that the generalization abilities of the proposed DFCCNNs are better than those of the conventional FCNNs reported in the literature.	Semantic Scholar

This letter presents an enhanced external torque estimation algorithm for series elastic actuators (SEAs) expanding the usability of the residual-based technique.	Semantic Scholar
Although the residual method demonstrates online torque estimation capability in diverse applications and thus becomes popular, it is practically challenging to achieve accurate estimation performance in a wide stiffness range of SEAs.	Semantic Scholar
The performance degradation is mainly induced by inaccurate transmission torque information, which is stemmed from unexpected errors in the spring deflection based torque sensing.	Semantic Scholar
To overcome the issue, this letter analyses the limitation of the conventional approach in frequency domain and proposes the enhanced residual to be used over a wide stiffness range of SEAs.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of proposed method is comparatively verified with conventional method in the both of simulations and experiments.	Semantic Scholar
With the rapid development of mobile networks and the widespread usage of mobile devices, spatial crowdsourcing, which refers to assigning location-based tasks to moving workers, has drawn increasing attention.	Semantic Scholar
One of the important issues in spatial crowdsourcing is task assignment, which allocates tasks to appropriate workers.	Semantic Scholar
However, existing works generally assume that no rejection would happen after the task assignment is completed by the server.	Semantic Scholar
Ignorance of such an operation can lead to low system throughput.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, in this paper, we take workers’ rejection into consideration and try to maximize workers’ acceptance in order to improve the system throughput.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we first formally define the problem of maximizing workers’ acceptance in rejection-aware spatial crowdsourcing.	Semantic Scholar
Unfortunately, the problem is NP-hard.	Semantic Scholar
We propose two exact solutions to obtain the optimal assignment, but they are not efficient enough and not scalable for large inputs.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we present four approximation approaches for improving the efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we show the effectiveness of the proposed pruning strategy for the exact solutions and the superiority of the proposed Greedy algorithm over other approximation methods through extensive experiments.	Semantic Scholar

A spike train kernel provides an effective way of decoding information represented by a spike train.	Semantic Scholar
Some spike train kernels have been extended to multineuron spike trains, which are simultaneously recorded spike trains obtained from multiple neurons.	Semantic Scholar
However, most of these multineuron extensions were carried out in a kernel-specific manner.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a general framework is proposed for extending any single-neuron spike train kernel to multineuron spike trains, based on the R-convolution kernel.	Semantic Scholar
Special subclasses of the proposed R-convolution linear combination kernel are explored.	Semantic Scholar
These subclasses have a smaller number of parameters and make optimization tractable when the size of data is limited.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed kernel was evaluated using Gaussian process regression for multineuron spike trains recorded from an animal brain.	Semantic Scholar
It was compared with the sum kernel and the population Spikernel, which are existing ways of decoding multineuron spike trains using kernels.	Semantic Scholar
The results showed that the proposed approach performs better than these kernels and also other commonly used neural decoding methods.	Semantic Scholar
Precise catheter control is crucial to the success of radiofrequency cardiac arrhythmia ablations.	Semantic Scholar
Remote control using external magnetic fields to directly steer the catheter tip is a promising strategy to accurately and easily perform cardiac catheter steering.	Semantic Scholar
Magnetic catheters must be flexible enough to be deflected by a magnetic field but rigid enough to provide sufficient force and stability during ablation.	Semantic Scholar
These conflicting requirements have limited the design options and effectiveness of magnetic catheters.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the ablation force achievable by magnetic catheters depends strongly on the catheter's bending angle; at angles greater than 90°, it can be very difficult to achieve any significant force during ablation.	Semantic Scholar
To overcome these shortcomings, we propose to magnetically control a flexible segment at the distal tip of the introducer sheath, rather than the catheter.	Semantic Scholar
Control of the tip orientation is thus decoupled from catheter insertion, enabling more robust and intuitive manipulability of the catheter.	Semantic Scholar
Usability testing with the Aeon Phocus, a magnetic navigation system, has shown that the control of this magnetic sheath is indeed more intuitive than the control of a standard magnetic catheter.	Semantic Scholar

Over the past few decades, the design of an intelligent Intrusion Detection System (IDS) remains an open challenge to the research community.	Semantic Scholar
Continuous efforts by the researchers have resulted in the development of several learning models based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to improve the performance of the IDSs.	Semantic Scholar
However, there exists a tradeoff with respect to the stability of ANN architecture and the detection rate for less frequent attacks.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a novel approach based on Helly property of Hypergraph and Arithmetic Residue-based Probabilistic Neural Network (HG AR-PNN) to address the classification problem in IDS.	Semantic Scholar
The Helly property of Hypergraph was exploited for the identification of the optimal feature subset and the arithmetic residue of the optimal feature subset was used to train the PNN.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of HG AR-PNN was evaluated using KDD CUP 1999 intrusion dataset.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results prove the dominance of HG AR-PNN classifier over the existing classifiers with respect to the stability and improved detection rate for less frequent attacks.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a set of convex low-rank inducing norms for coupled matrices and tensors (hereafter referred to as coupled tensors), in which information is shared between the matrices and tensors through common modes.	Semantic Scholar
More specifically, we first propose a mixture of the overlapped trace norm and the latent norms with the matrix trace norm, and then, propose a completion model regularized using these norms to impute coupled tensors.	Semantic Scholar
A key advantage of the proposed norms is that they are convex and can be used to find a globally optimal solution, whereas existing methods for coupled learning are nonconvex.	Semantic Scholar
We also analyze the excess risk bounds of the completion model regularized using our proposed norms and show that they can exploit the low-rankness of coupled tensors, leading to better bounds compared to those obtained using uncoupled norms.	Semantic Scholar
Through synthetic and real-data experiments, we show that the proposed completion model compares favorably with existing ones.	Semantic Scholar
Effective robot programming by demonstration requires the availability of multiple demonstrations to learn about all relevant aspects of the demonstrated skill or task.	Semantic Scholar
Typically, a human teacher must demonstrate several variants of the desired task to generate a sufficient amount of data to reliably learn it.	Semantic Scholar
Here a problem often arises that there is a large variability in the speed of execution across human demonstrations.	Semantic Scholar
This can cause problems when multiple demonstrations are compared to extract the relevant information for learning.	Semantic Scholar
In this paperwe propose an extension of dynamicmovement primitives called arc-length dynamicmovement primitives, where spatial and temporal components ofmotion arewell separated.	Semantic Scholar
We show theoretically and experimentally that the proposed representation can be effectively applied for robot skill learning and action recognition even when there are large variations in the speed of demonstrated movements.	Semantic Scholar

In this letter, we propose a new type of electromagnetic actuator called the “programmable permanent magnet” (PPM) actuator.	Semantic Scholar
The PPM actuator is designed to tackle low-speed high-torque applications where classic electromagnetic actuators are highly inefficient.	Semantic Scholar
The PPM actuator is based on the application of pulsed current to magnetize a hard ferromagnetic stator that is made of individual SmCo (custom grade) magnets placed in a Halbach array configuration.	Semantic Scholar
The motor creates a springlike torque function that generates up to 0.2 N $\cdot$m.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike electromagnetic actuators, by design, the PPM actuator does not draw current while exerting torque.	Semantic Scholar
Instead, the motor's power consumption depends on its rotational speed or torque variations.	Semantic Scholar
The PPM actuator is, by consequence, most efficient, whereas classical electromagnetic motors are most inefficient, and is a new alternative to actuators for robotic applications, which tend to operate in low-speed, high-torque conditions.	Semantic Scholar
The prototyped PPM actuator measures 47 mm in diameter, with a height of 35 mm and weight of 200 g, and has been successfully integrated in a commercially available 2-finger gripper from Robotiq, Inc.	Semantic Scholar
Coupled Generative Adversarial Network (CoGAN) was recently introduced in order to model a joint distribution of a multi modal dataset.	Semantic Scholar
The CoGAN model lacks the capability to handle noisy data as well as it is computationally expensive and inefficient for practical applications such as cross-domain image transformation.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a new method, named the Coupled Generative Adversarial Stacked Auto-encoder (CoGASA), to directly transfer data from one domain to another domain with robustness to noise in the input data as well to as reduce the computation time.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate the proposed model using MNIST and the Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) datasets, and the results demonstrate a highly competitive performance.	Semantic Scholar
Our proposed models can easily transfer images into the target domain with minimal effort.	Semantic Scholar
Computing shortest distances is a central task in many domains.	Semantic Scholar
The growing number of applications dealing with dynamic graphs calls for incremental algorithms, as it is impractical to recompute shortest distances from scratch every time updates occur.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we address the problem of maintaining all-pairs shortest distances in dynamic graphs.	Semantic Scholar
We propose efficient incremental algorithms to process sequences of edge deletions/insertions/updates and vertex deletions/insertions.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach relies on some general operators that can be easily “instantiated” both in main memory and on top of different underlying DBMSs.	Semantic Scholar
We provide complexity analyses of the proposed algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on several real-world datasets show that current main-memory algorithms become soon impractical, disk-based ones are needed for larger graphs, and our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
There has been an increasing recognition that a number of key computational problems require distributed solution techniques.	Semantic Scholar
To facilitate the creation and advancement of these techniques, researchers have developed the distributed constraint satisfaction and optimization (DCSP/DCOP) formalisms with the understanding that many critical real-world problems can be represented using them.	Semantic Scholar
Subsequently, these formalisms have led to the creation of numerous protocols where most ignore a critical feature of the problems they are designed to solve: the problems change over time.	Semantic Scholar
Dynamic variations of the DCSP and DCOP formalisms were invented to address this deficiency, but these models have received inadequate attention from the research community.	Semantic Scholar
A key impediment to advancing this research area is the lack of a compelling theoretical underpinning to the analysis of these problems and the evaluation of the protocols used to solve them.	Semantic Scholar
This work creates a mapping of the DynDCSP and DynDCOP formalisms onto thermodynamic systems.	Semantic Scholar
Under this mapping, it shows that these problems obey the three laws of thermodynamics.	Semantic Scholar
Utilizing these laws, this work develops, for the first time, a method for characterizing the impact that dynamics has on a distributed problem as well as a technique for predicting the expected performance of distributed protocols under various levels of dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents the design and potential impact of the developed Research Oriented Underwater Glider for Hands-on Investigative Engineering (ROUGHIE).	Semantic Scholar
The ROUGHIE is an open-source, highly maneuverable, and low-cost vehicle that enables rapid development and testing of new hardware and software.	Semantic Scholar
ROUGHIE is an internally actuated glider capable of performing steady sawtooth glides in shallow water down to 3 m, tight turns with a minimum radius of 3 m, and a minimum endurance of 60 h. The novelty of this study is twofold: 1) a rail-based design to facilitate modularity and ease of assembly and 2) an effective internal rotary mass mechanism to increase maneuverability and perform tight turns.	Semantic Scholar
The ROUGHIE design strategically uses 3D printed plastic parts in low stress situations, which allows extreme design flexibility and enables tightly packed modules that can be easily customized.	Semantic Scholar
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are very popular these days, and are the subject of a very intense investigation.	Semantic Scholar
A DNN is made up of layers of internal units (or neurons), each of which computes an affine combination of the output of the units in the previous layer, applies a nonlinear operator, and outputs the corresponding value (also known as activation).	Semantic Scholar
A commonly-used nonlinear operator is the so-called rectified linear unit (ReLU), whose output is just the maximum between its input value and zero.	Semantic Scholar
In this (and other similar cases like max pooling, where the max operation involves more than one input value), for fixed parameters one can model the DNN as a 0-1 Mixed Integer Linear Program (0-1 MILP) where the continuous variables correspond to the output values of each unit, and a binary variable is associated with each ReLU to model its yes/no nature.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we discuss the peculiarity of this kind of 0-1 MILP models, and describe an effective bound-tightening technique intended to ease its solution.	Semantic Scholar
We also present possible applications of the 0-1 MILP model arising in feature visualization and in the construction of adversarial examples.	Semantic Scholar
Computational results are reported, aimed at investigating (on small DNNs) the computational performance of a state-of-the-art MILP solver when applied to a known test case, namely, hand-written digit recognition.	Semantic Scholar
In the development of advanced driver-assist systems (ADAS) for lane-keeping or cornering, one important design objective is to appropriately share the steering control with the driver.	Semantic Scholar
The steering behavior of the driver must therefore be well characterized for the design of a high-performance ADAS controller.	Semantic Scholar
This paper adopts the well-known two-point visual driver model to characterize the steering behavior of the driver, and conducts a series of field tests to identify the model parameters and validate this model in real-world scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
An extended Kalman filter and an unscented Kalman filter are implemented for estimating the driver parameters using either a joint-state estimation algorithm or a dual estimation algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The estimated parameters for different types of drivers are analyzed and compared.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that the two-point visual driver model captures realistic driving behavior with time-varying, but not necessarily constant, parameters.	Semantic Scholar
A wavelet analysis of the driver steering command shows that distinct driver classes can be identified by analyzing the smoothness of the driver command using the Lipschitz exponents of the recorded signals.	Semantic Scholar
This paper discusses impulsive synchronization of stochastic reaction-diffusion neural networks with Dirichlet boundary conditions and hybrid time delays.	Semantic Scholar
By virtue of inequality techniques, theories of stochastic analysis, linear matrix inequalities, and the contradiction method, sufficient criteria are proposed to ensure exponential synchronization of the addressed stochastic reaction-diffusion neural networks with mixed time delays via a designed impulsive controller.	Semantic Scholar
Compared with some recent studies, the neural network models herein are more general, some restrictions are relaxed, and the obtained conditions enhance and generalize some published ones.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, two numerical simulations are performed to substantiate the validity and merits of the developed theoretical analysis.	Semantic Scholar
The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a human-like steering model that can capture, not only the mean, but also the intradriver variability (IDV) of steering behavior, in both routine and emergency scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
The IDV model proposed in this study is based on the assumption that steering behavior, in both scenarios, is governed by the same principles as performing point-to-point reaching tasks.	Semantic Scholar
The optimal feedback control framework that models the reaching tasks, and the presence of signal-dependent noise in motor commands and sensory feedback, are the mainstays of the proposed model.	Semantic Scholar
The driver is assumed to have acquired an internal model of system (muscles, arms, and vehicle) dynamics, and has a preview of the upcoming road.	Semantic Scholar
The model is validated using simulator-based data from both routine (curve negotiation) and emergency (obstacle avoidance) scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
"The IDV model could capture mean steering torque behavior in both routine (variance accounted for (VAF) <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$=$ </tex-math></inline-formula> 92% and emergency (VAF <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$=$</tex-math> </inline-formula> 74% scenarios, but more prominently, it could capture the standard deviation of the steering torque as well, in both routine (VAF <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$=$</tex-math></inline-formula> 83% and emergency (VAF <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$=$</tex-math></inline-formula> 65% scenarios."	Semantic Scholar
The promising results show that including signal-dependent noise and modeling steering as a reaching task are steps in the right direction in the field of driver modeling.	Semantic Scholar
The model, however, poorly captured the lateral deviation behavior, primarily suspected due to the satisficing behavior exhibited by humans.	Semantic Scholar
Developing a nonlinear-iterative version of the IDV model could address the limitations.	Semantic Scholar
Gait-based person identification suffers from the problem of different covariate factors such as clothing and carrying objects, which drastically reduce the recognition rate.	Semantic Scholar
Most existing methods capture dynamic and static information and remove the covariate factors without any systematic study.	Semantic Scholar
However, it has been reported in the literature that the head is one of the important features and the removal of the head from static information decreases the recognition rate.	Semantic Scholar
In our preliminary study, we developed a novel random walk (RW)-based gait extraction method that retains the head portion and removes certain static body parts to reduce the effect of covariate factors.	Semantic Scholar
The RW-based method is a novel gait feature extraction method and should be exploited more for its discriminative power to separate different body parts efficiently.	Semantic Scholar
However, the dynamic part is also significant in gait information, which is not very effectively represented in the RW-based gait extraction method.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, a discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based frequency component of the gait is considered to represent the dynamic part of gait information.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we propose a novel gait recognition algorithm that fuses dynamic and static information from DFT- and RW-based representations.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method systematically retains the discriminative static gait information along with the frequency attribute embedded as the dynamic gait information.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Automation and the HumanID datasets have been carried out to demonstrate that the proposed fused gait features-based approach outperforms the existing methods, particularly when there are substantial appearance changes.	Semantic Scholar
Continuous crop monitoring is an important aspect of precision agriculture and requires the registration of sensor data over longer periods of time.	Semantic Scholar
Often, fields are monitored using cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) but strong changes in the visual appearance of the growing crops and the field itself poses serious challenges to conventional image registration methods.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a method for registering images of agricultural fields taken by an UAV over the crop season and present a complete pipeline for computing temporally aligned three-dimensional (3-D) point clouds of the field.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach exploits the inherent geometry of the crop arrangement in the field, which remains mostly static over time.	Semantic Scholar
This allows us to register the images even in the presence of strong visual changes.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we propose a scale invariant, geometric feature descriptor that encodes the local plant arrangement geometry.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments suggest that we are able to register images taken over the crop season, including situations where matching with an off-the-shelf visual descriptor fails.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate the accuracy of our matching system with respect to manually labeled ground truth.	Semantic Scholar
We furthermore illustrate that the reconstructed 3-D models are qualitatively correct and the registration results allow for monitoring growth parameters at a per plant level.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we address the problem of detecting intruders in complex bidimensional environments with a team of robots arranged in line formations called sweep lines.	Semantic Scholar
Sweep lines are used to coordinate the motion of multiple robots and guarantee the detection of any number of arbitrarily fast intruders, even when each robot has a limited sensor footprint.	Semantic Scholar
We present a formalization of the problem, coined Line-Clear, which requires the computation of sweep schedules to coordinate the motion of multiple sweep lines using the fewest robots possible.	Semantic Scholar
We provide a proof of NP-hardness of the general Line-Clear problem based on results from graph searching.	Semantic Scholar
An algorithm to compute sweep schedules for simply connected environments, which additionally guarantees that the cleared area is connected and not recontaminated, is then presented.	Semantic Scholar
We analyze its complexity formally and in simulation experiments and present solutions for a number of subproblems required for an implementation of the algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The analysis provides a formal criterion for when the algorithm runs in polynomial time and the experiments indicate that this criterion may be satisfied for most environments in practice.	Semantic Scholar
Minor component (MC) plays an important role in signal processing and data analysis, so it is a valuable work to develop MC extraction algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the concepts of weighted subspace and optimum theory, a weighted information criterion is proposed for searching the optimum solution of a linear neural network.	Semantic Scholar
This information criterion exhibits a unique global minimum attained if and only if the state matrix is composed of the desired MCs of an autocorrelation matrix of an input signal.	Semantic Scholar
By using gradient ascent method and recursive least square (RLS) method, two algorithms are developed for multiple MCs extraction.	Semantic Scholar
The global convergences of the proposed algorithms are also analyzed by the Lyapunov method.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed algorithms can extract the multiple MCs in parallel and has advantage in dealing with high dimension matrices.	Semantic Scholar
Since the weighted matrix does not require an accurate value, it facilitates the system design of the proposed algorithms for practical applications.	Semantic Scholar
The speed and computation advantages of the proposed algorithms are verified through simulations.	Semantic Scholar
With the popularity of social media (e.g., Facebook and Flicker), users can easily share their check-in records and photos during their trips.	Semantic Scholar
In view of the huge number of user historical mobility records in social media, we aim to discover travel experiences to facilitate trip planning.	Semantic Scholar
When planning a trip, users always have specific preferences regarding their trips.	Semantic Scholar
Instead of restricting users to limited query options such as locations, activities, or time periods, we consider arbitrary text descriptions as keywords about personalized requirements.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, a diverse and representative set of recommended travel routes is needed.	Semantic Scholar
Prior works have elaborated on mining and ranking existing routes from check-in data.	Semantic Scholar
To meet the need for automatic trip organization, we claim that more features of Places of Interest (POIs) should be extracted.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient Keyword-aware Representative Travel Route framework that uses knowledge extraction from users’ historical mobility records and social interactions.	Semantic Scholar
Explicitly, we have designed a keyword extraction module to classify the POI-related tags, for effective matching with query keywords.	Semantic Scholar
We have further designed a route reconstruction algorithm to construct route candidates that fulfill the requirements.	Semantic Scholar
To provide befitting query results, we explore Representative Skyline concepts, that is, the Skyline routes which best describe the trade-offs among different POI features.	Semantic Scholar
To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms, we have conducted extensive experiments on real location-based social network datasets, and the experiment results show that our methods do indeed demonstrate good performance compared to state-of-the-art works.	Semantic Scholar
We report on the model-based development of the pronking and trotting behaviors of a leg-wheel transformable robot.	Semantic Scholar
The spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model serves as the motion template; its stable running motion is investigated, and the parameters and state conditions suitable for implementation in the robot are selected.	Semantic Scholar
Mapping between the SLIP model and the robot is conducted so that the running of the SLIP model can be transformed into the robot's pronking and trotting behaviors.	Semantic Scholar
The spring effect of the leg-wheel is achieved using force control with motor current feedback.	Semantic Scholar
The robot was operated to initiate four different dynamic behaviors with variations in stiffness and gait based on four different fixed-point trajectories of the SLIP model.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results confirm that the proposed strategy is effective in initiating the dynamic behaviors.	Semantic Scholar

Human driver's pedal behavior is difficult to model because it is the output of a very complicated virtual stochastic system.	Semantic Scholar
This paper provides a new way to describe driver's pedal behavior after decomposing it into a sequence of actions.	Semantic Scholar
By considering the vehicle and road information as the inputs and the pedal action as the output, an input–output hidden Markov model (IOHMM) is used to describe the pedal behavior.	Semantic Scholar
The state transition and output distribution functions are designed, and the relation between the input and the key variables of the output distributions is analyzed and modeled using statistical methods.	Semantic Scholar
The model parameters can be identified for individual drivers using the generalized estimation-maximization method.	Semantic Scholar
One-step probability prediction test shows that the proposed model can capture and distinguish each individual driver's driving style.	Semantic Scholar
The prediction capability of the proposed model is evaluated by comparing it with the human driver data collected on a driving simulator along with three other models.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that the proposed IOHMM-based driver pedal behavior model performs well in prediction horizons from 1 to 60 s.	Semantic Scholar

The use of aerial swarms to solve real-world problems has been increasing steadily, accompanied by falling prices and improving performance of communication, sensing, and processing hardware.	Semantic Scholar
The commoditization of hardware has reduced unit costs, thereby lowering the barriers to entry to the field of aerial swarm robotics.	Semantic Scholar
A key enabling technology for swarms is the family of algorithms that allow the individual members of the swarm to communicate and allocate tasks amongst themselves, plan their trajectories, and coordinate their flight in such a way that the overall objectives of the swarm are achieved efficiently.	Semantic Scholar
These algorithms, often organized in a hierarchical fashion, endow the swarm with autonomy at every level, and the role of a human operator can be reduced, in principle, to interactions at a higher level without direct intervention.	Semantic Scholar
This technology depends on the clever and innovative application of theoretical tools from control and estimation.	Semantic Scholar
This paper reviews the state of the art of these theoretical tools, specifically focusing on how they have been developed for, and applied to, aerial swarms.	Semantic Scholar
Aerial swarms differ from swarms of ground-based vehicles in two respects: they operate in a three-dimensional space and the dynamics of individual vehicles adds an extra layer of complexity.	Semantic Scholar
We review dynamic modeling and conditions for stability and controllability that are essential in order to achieve cooperative flight and distributed sensing.	Semantic Scholar
The main sections of this paper focus on major results covering trajectory generation, task allocation, adversarial control, distributed sensing, monitoring, and mapping.	Semantic Scholar
Wherever possible, we indicate how the physics and subsystem technologies of aerial robots are brought to bear on these individual areas.	Semantic Scholar
This paper investigates the problems of exponential stability and dissipativity of generalized neural networks (GNNs) with time-varying delay signals.	Semantic Scholar
By constructing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals (LKFs) with triple integral terms that contain more advantages of the state vectors of the neural networks, and the upper bound on the time-varying delay signals are formulated.	Semantic Scholar
We employ a new integral inequality technique (IIT), free-matrix-based (FMB) integral inequality approach, and Wirtinger double integral inequality (WDII) technique together with the reciprocally convex combination (RCC) approach to bound the time derivative of the LKFs.	Semantic Scholar
An improved exponential stability and strictly (Q,S,R)-γ-dissipative conditions of the addressed systems are represented by the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).	Semantic Scholar
Finally, four interesting numerical examples are developed to verify the usefulness of the proposed method with a practical application to a biological network.	Semantic Scholar

Visualization from trained deep neural networks has drawn massive public attention in recent.	Semantic Scholar
One of the visualization approaches is to train images maximizing the activation of specific neurons.	Semantic Scholar
However, directly maximizing the activation would lead to unrecognizable images, which cannot provide any meaningful information.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we introduce a simple but effective technique to constrain the optimization route of the visualization.	Semantic Scholar
By adding two totally inverse transformations, image blurring and deblurring, to the optimization procedure, recognizable images can be created.	Semantic Scholar
Our algorithm is good at extracting the details in the images, which are usually filtered by previous methods in the visualizations.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on AlexNet, VGGNet and GoogLeNet illustrate that we can better understand the neural networks utilizing the knowledge obtained by the visualization.	Semantic Scholar

Maintaining competitiveness and mitigating health issues test caused by unergonomic working conditions are two main reasons for automating production processes.	Semantic Scholar
But such automation is expensive, also because test experts are required to program the robots.	Semantic Scholar
One approach to lowering these costs is to enable shop-floor workers to program robots by providing task-level programming tools.	Semantic Scholar
Task-level programming is an established approach, yet appropriate workflows for experts and shop-floor workers remain to be defined.	Semantic Scholar
The objective of this letter is to evaluate RAZER, a framework for robot task-level programming, in which skill programming and parameter interface definitions are integrated.	Semantic Scholar
The framework provides workflows for both experts—creating skills and providing their parameter interfaces—and for shop-floor workers—using these skills to create executable robot tasks in an intuitive human–robot interface (HRI).	Semantic Scholar
The HRI is a graphical user interface that runs in a browser, and provides access to other man–machine interface, such as programming by demonstration.	Semantic Scholar
Two pilot and two user studies proof that RAZER fulfills the demands of both experts and novice users.	Semantic Scholar
We present a certifiably globally optimal algorithm for determining the extrinsic calibration between two sensors that are capable of producing independent egomotion estimates.	Semantic Scholar
This problem has been previously solved using a variety of techniques, including local optimization approaches that have no formal global optimality guarantees.	Semantic Scholar
We use a quadratic objective function to formulate calibration as a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP).	Semantic Scholar
By leveraging recent advances in the optimization of QCQPs, we are able to use existing semidefinite program solvers to obtain a certifiably global optimum via the Lagrangian dual problem.	Semantic Scholar
Our problem formulation can be globally optimized by existing general-purpose solvers in less than a second, regardless of the number of measurements available and the noise level.	Semantic Scholar
This enables a variety of robotic platforms to rapidly and robustly compute and certify a globally optimal set of calibration parameters without a prior estimate or operator intervention.	Semantic Scholar
We compare the performance of our approach with a local solver on extensive simulations and multiple real datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we present necessary observability conditions that connect our approach to recent theoretical results and analytically support the empirical performance of our system.	Semantic Scholar
In vivo manipulation of biological cells has attracted considerable attention in recent years.	Semantic Scholar

An enhanced disturbance compensation controller is developed to minimize the effect of fluids (e.g., blood flow) on the cell.	Semantic Scholar
The method has exhibited advantages of flexibility in adjusting cell tracking trajectory online and the capability to minimize steady-state error and eliminate overshoot.	Semantic Scholar
Simulations and experiments of tracking single target cells in living zebrafish embryos have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a dynamic in vivo environment.	Semantic Scholar
Soft dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) exhibit interesting muscle-like behavior for the development of soft robots.	Semantic Scholar
However, it is challenging to model these soft actuators due to their material nonlinearity, nonlinear electromechanical coupling, and time-dependent viscoelastic behavior.	Semantic Scholar
Most recent studies on DEAs focus on issues of mechanics, physics, and material science, while much less importance is given to quantitative characterization of DEAs.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a detailed experimental investigation probing the voltage-induced electromechanical response of a soft DEA that is subjected to cyclic loading and propose a general constitutive modeling approach to characterize the time-dependent response, based on the principles of nonequilibrium thermodynamics.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, some of the key observations are found as follows: 1) Creep exhibits the drift phenomenon, and is dominant during the first three cycles.	Semantic Scholar
The creep decreases over time and becomes less dominant after the first few cycles; 2) a significant amount of hysteresis is observed during all cycles and it becomes repeatable after the first few cycles; 3) the peak of the displacement is shifted from the peak of the voltage signal and occurs after it.	Semantic Scholar
To account for these viscoelastic phenomena, a constitutive model is developed by employing several dissipative nonequilibrium mechanisms.	Semantic Scholar
The quantitative comparisons of the experimental and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed model.	Semantic Scholar
This modeling approach can be useful for control of a viscoelastic DEA and paves the way to emerging applications of soft robots.	Semantic Scholar

Joint torque sensing represents one of the foundations and vital components of modern robotic systems that target to match closely the physical interaction performance of biological systems through the realization of torque controlled actuators.	Semantic Scholar
However, despite decades of studies on the development of different torque sensors, the design of accurate and reliable torque sensors still remains challenging for the majority of the robotics community preventing the use of the technology.	Semantic Scholar
This letter proposes and evaluates two joint torque sensing elements based on strain gauge and deflection-encoder principles.	Semantic Scholar
The two designs are elaborated and their performance from different perspectives and practical factors are evaluated including resolution, nonaxial moments load crosstalk, torque ripple rejection, bandwidth, noise/residual offset level, and thermal/time dependent signal drift.	Semantic Scholar
The letter reveals the practical details and the pros and cons of each sensor principle providing valuable contributions into the field toward the realization of higher fidelity joint torque sensing performance.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, a cascaded loop force control is implemented on a robot while considering the flexibility of the force sensor connecting the end effector to the tool.	Semantic Scholar
A classical frequency approach using a bandwidth and a phase margin is used to tune this controller.	Semantic Scholar
The aim is to find an equivalence between the proposed control law and a classical impedance control law.	Semantic Scholar
The apparent impedance of this system is calculated and can be seen as the desired impedance for a classical impedance control law.	Semantic Scholar
Using this equivalence, the cascaded loop force controller can be tuned to an impedance controller, and can be shown to behave equivalently in simulations and experiments on a one degree of freedom robot.	Semantic Scholar
Physical compliance can be considered one of the key technical properties a robot should exhibit to increase its mechanical robustness.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the accompanying temporal energy-storing capabilities enable explosive and energy efficient cyclic motions.	Semantic Scholar
But these advantages come at a price, as compliance introduces unwanted intrinsic oscillatory dynamics, underactuation, and reduces the natural frequency of the plant.	Semantic Scholar
These aspects make control of the link configuration variables a challenging task.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents two novel control methods for implementing link-side motion tracking capabilities and injecting a desired damping characteristic to suppress link vibrations along the reference trajectory for compliantly actuated robots with nonlinear elastic characteristics.	Semantic Scholar
We prove their uniform global asymptotic stability by invoking a theorem by Matrosov.	Semantic Scholar
Both approaches, namely elastic structure preserving (ESP) and ESP+, have in common that they preserve the link-side inertial properties and the elastic structure of the original plant dynamics, hence the name ESP control.	Semantic Scholar
Apart from that, ESP control focuses on preserving the inertial properties of motor dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
While ESP+ control aims at minimizing the dynamic shaping on the motor side.	Semantic Scholar
The performance of the feedback control laws have been evaluated on the Hand Arm System from the German Aerospace Center (DLR), a variable stiffness robot arm, where the stiffness in each of its joints is highly nonlinear.	Semantic Scholar
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimentally validated tracking controller for compliantly actuated, multijoint robots with nonlinear elastic elements.	Semantic Scholar
Small-world networks provide an excellent balance of efficiency and robustness that is not available with other network topologies.	Semantic Scholar
These characteristics are exhibited in the Memristive Nanowire Neural Network (MN3), a novel neuromorphic hardware architecture.	Semantic Scholar
This architecture is composed of an electrode array connected by stochastically deposited core-shell nanowires.	Semantic Scholar
We simulate the stochastic behavior of the nanowires by making various assumptions on their paths.	Semantic Scholar
First, we assume that the nanowires follow straight paths.	Semantic Scholar
Next, we assume that they follow arc paths with varying radii.	Semantic Scholar
Last, we assume that they follow paths generated by pink noise.	Semantic Scholar
For each of the three methods, we present a method to find whether a nanowire passes over an electrode, allowing us to represent the architecture as a bipartite graph.	Semantic Scholar
We find that the small-worldness coefficient increases logarithmically and is consistently greater than one, which is indicative of a small-world network.	Semantic Scholar
We consider a cumulative scheduling problem where a task duration and resource consumption are not fixed.	Semantic Scholar
The consumption profile of the task, which can vary continuously over time, is a decision variable of the problem to be determined and a task is completed as soon as the integration over its time window of a non-decreasing and continuous processing rate function of the consumption profile has reached a predefined amount of energy.	Semantic Scholar
The goal is to find a feasible schedule, which is an NP-hard problem.	Semantic Scholar
For the case where functions are concave and piecewise linear, we present two propagation algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
The first one is the adaptation to concave functions of the variant of the energetic reasoning previously established for linear functions.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, a full characterization of the relevant intervals for time-window adjustments is provided.	Semantic Scholar
The second algorithm combines a flow-based checker with time-bound adjustments derived from the time-table disjunctive reasoning for the cumulative constraint.	Semantic Scholar
Complementarity of the algorithms is assessed via their integration in a hybrid branch-and-bound and computational experiments on small-size instances.	Semantic Scholar
The exponential synchronization of hybrid coupled reaction-diffusion neural networks with time delays is discussed in this article.	Semantic Scholar
At first, a generalized intermittent control with spacial sampled-data is introduced, which is intermittent in time and data sampling in space.	Semantic Scholar
This type of control strategy not only can unify the traditional periodic intermittent control and the aperiodic case, but also can lower the update rate of the controller in both temporal and spatial domains.	Semantic Scholar
Next, based on the designed control protocol and the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach, some novel and readily verified criteria are established to guarantee the exponential synchronization of the considered networks.	Semantic Scholar
These criteria depend on the diffusion coefficients, coupled strengths, time delays as well as control parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is shown by a numerical example.	Semantic Scholar
This letter considers the problem of dictionary learning for sparse signal representation whose atoms have low mutual coherence.	Semantic Scholar
To learn such dictionaries, at each step, we first update the dictionary using the method of optimal directions (MOD) and then apply a dictionary rank shrinkage step to decrease its mutual coherence.	Semantic Scholar
In the rank shrinkage step, we first compute a rank 1 decomposition of the column-normalized least squares estimate of the dictionary obtained from the MOD step.	Semantic Scholar
We then shrink the rank of this learned dictionary by transforming the problem of reducing the rank to a nonnegative garrotte estimation problem and solving it using a path-wise coordinate descent approach.	Semantic Scholar
We establish theoretical results that show that the rank shrinkage step included will reduce the coherence of the dictionary, which is further validated by experimental results.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical experiments illustrating the performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison to various other well-known dictionary learning algorithms are also presented.	Semantic Scholar
This paper addresses the attitude controllability problem for a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in case of one or several actuators failures.	Semantic Scholar

Analytical results are then validated experimentally on a coaxial octorotor.	Semantic Scholar
A stabilization control law is applied on the coaxial configuration under one, two, three and four motors failures, when the system is controllable.	Semantic Scholar
Real-time experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the applied strategy.	Semantic Scholar
Formal analysis of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and dynamical systems requires a solid formalization of the underlying theory.	Semantic Scholar
The formalization needs to be at the correct level of abstraction, in order to avoid drowning in tedious reasoning about technical details.	Semantic Scholar
The flow of an ODE, i.e., the solution depending on initial conditions, and a dedicated type of bounded linear functions yield suitable abstractions.	Semantic Scholar
The dedicated type integrates well with the type-class based analysis in Isabelle/HOL and we prove advanced properties of the flow, most notably, differentiable dependence on initial conditions via the variational equation.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we formalize the notion of first return or Poincaré map and prove its differentiability.	Semantic Scholar
We provide rigorous numerical algorithm to solve the variational equation and compute the Poincaré map.	Semantic Scholar

The robot system plans the actions of both the grasping and cleaning arms using its current model of the part deformation behavior, and attempts to minimize the overall cleaning time by finding plans that use a small number of grasping positions on the part.	Semantic Scholar
A finite-element method approach is used to model the part deformation and a general update algorithm is presented that can modify the stiffness parameters of the model to match observed deformation data collected during cleaning.	Semantic Scholar
This allows the system to very quickly discover the correct locations to grasp the part so as to minimize deformation.	Semantic Scholar
The methods described in this lettter are shown to achieve better results than the ones from our previous work: The results are much smoother, along with a twofold reduction in parameter-estimation error, and notable faster convergence.	Semantic Scholar
Our aim is to recognise the words being spoken by a talking face, given only the video but not the audio.	Semantic Scholar
Existing works in this area have focussed on trying to recognise a small number of utterances in controlled environments (e.g.	Semantic Scholar

We make three novel contributions: first, we develop a pipeline for fully automated data collection from TV broadcasts.	Semantic Scholar
With this we have generated a dataset with over a million word instances, spoken by over a thousand different people; second, we develop a two-stream convolutional neural network that learns a joint embedding between the sound and the mouth motions from unlabelled data.	Semantic Scholar
We apply this network to the tasks of audio-to-video synchronisation and active speaker detection; third, we train convolutional and recurrent networks that are able to effectively learn and recognize hundreds of words from this large-scale dataset.	Semantic Scholar

Uniquely, we demonstrate the ability of our learned image descriptor to generalise beyond the categories of object present in our training data, forming a basis for general cross-category SBIR.	Semantic Scholar
We explore appropriate strategies for training, and for deriving a compact image descriptor from the learned representation suitable for indexing data on resource constrained e. g. mobile devices.	Semantic Scholar
We show the learned descriptors to outperform state of the art SBIR on the defacto standard Flickr15k dataset using a significantly more compact (56 bits per image, i. e. ≈105KB total) search index than previous methods.	Semantic Scholar
As precise motion-controlled applications of mobile untethered devices emerge into real-world scenarios, full manipulator dexterity will be required.	Semantic Scholar
In rigid bodies without joints, one such requirement will be the ability to control all six-degrees-of-freedom (DOF).	Semantic Scholar
Magnetic fields and their spatial gradients are ideal for micromanipulation due to their long-range strong forces and torques, but the 6-DOF closed-loop control of such devices is a current challenge.	Semantic Scholar
Here we present a single-body microrobot that simultaneously demonstrates all 6-DOF.	Semantic Scholar
We accomplish this through the magnetic shape anisotropy of the microrobot design, yielding magnetization components, which are used to generate a torque about the 6$^\text {th}$ DOF.	Semantic Scholar
We show that, under our design conditions, we can independently control the magnetic field as well as the magnetic force and torque.	Semantic Scholar
This allows for the open-loop control of the other rotational DOFs, assuming the microrobot net magnetization vector will align with the magnetic field.	Semantic Scholar
We also describe a method that enables posing the 6$^\text {th}$ DOF without feedback.	Semantic Scholar
These methods will enable the development of mobile submillimeter magnetic structures capable of full 6-DOF control for bioengineering, lab-on-a-chip, and desktop micromanufacturing applications.	Semantic Scholar
Self-driving vehicles have the potential to transform the way we travel.	Semantic Scholar
Their development is at a pivotal point, as a growing number of industrial and academic research organizations are bringing these technologies into controlled but real-world settings.	Semantic Scholar
An essential capability of a self-driving vehicle is environment understanding: Where are the pedestrians, the other vehicles, and the drivable space?	Semantic Scholar
In computer and robot vision, the task of identifying semantic categories at a per pixel level is known as scene parsing or semantic segmentation.	Semantic Scholar
While much progress has been made in scene parsing in recent years, current datasets for training and benchmarking scene parsing algorithms focus on nominal driving conditions: fair weather and mostly daytime lighting.	Semantic Scholar
To complement the standard benchmarks, we introduce the Raincouver scene parsing benchmark, which to our knowledge is the first scene parsing benchmark to focus on challenging rainy driving conditions, during the day, at dusk, and at night.	Semantic Scholar
Our dataset comprises half an hour of driving video captured on the roads of Vancouver, Canada, and 326 frames with hand-annotated pixelwise semantic labels.	Semantic Scholar
As both social network structure and strength of influence between individuals evolve constantly, it requires tracking the influential nodes under a dynamic setting.	Semantic Scholar
To address this problem, we explore the Influential Node Tracking (INT) problem as an extension to the traditional Influence Maximization problem (IM) under dynamic social networks.	Semantic Scholar
"While the Influence Maximization problem aims at identifying a set of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""li-ieq1-2620141.gif""/></alternatives> </inline-formula> nodes to maximize the joint influence under one static network, the INT problem focuses on tracking a set of influential nodes that keeps maximizing the influence as the network evolves."	Semantic Scholar
Utilizing the smoothness of the evolution of the network structure, we propose an efficient algorithm, Upper Bound Interchange Greedy (UBI) and a variant, UBI+.	Semantic Scholar
Instead of constructing the seed set from the ground, we start from the influential seed set we found previously and implement node replacement to improve the influence coverage.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, by using a fast update method by calculating the marginal gain of nodes, our algorithm can scale to dynamic social networks with millions of nodes.	Semantic Scholar
Empirical experiments on three real large-scale dynamic social networks show that our UBI and its variants, UBI+ achieves better performance in terms of both influence coverage and running time.	Semantic Scholar
Prolonged driving on monotonous roads often leads to a reduction in task load that causes drivers passive fatigue.	Semantic Scholar
Passive fatigue results in loss of driver alertness and is detrimental to driver safety.	Semantic Scholar
This paper focuses on the effect of a haptic guidance steering system on improving behaviors of passively fatigued drivers.	Semantic Scholar
By continuously exerting active torque on a steering wheel, the haptic system guides drivers to follow the centerline of a lane; meanwhile, the drivers sense the torque and interact with it while operating the steering wheel.	Semantic Scholar
An experiment was conducted with 12 healthy participants in a high-fidelity driving simulator.	Semantic Scholar
A monotonous driving course was designed, and vehicle speed was fixed in order to induce drivers’ passive fatigue.	Semantic Scholar
A treatment session was arranged with the haptic guidance steering system, and a control session was conducted as a comparison.	Semantic Scholar
Driving performance, assessed by standard deviation of lane position, mean absolute lateral error, and time-to-lane crossing, was significantly improved when haptic guidance was activated.	Semantic Scholar
Results of physiological measures, including heart rate variability and percentage of eye closure, revealed that passively fatigued drivers were aroused when they were aware of the active torque on the steering wheel.	Semantic Scholar
In conclusion, the activation of haptic guidance can be regarded as an effective countermeasure for the passively fatigued drivers who have performed a prolonged monotonous driving task.	Semantic Scholar
A ERIAL robotics has been one of the most active areas of research within the robotics community, and recently there have been many reports of promising results in aerial swarm systems.	Semantic Scholar
This is partly due to the commoditization of multicopter platforms, and communication, sensing, and processing hardware that has substantially lowered the barriers to entry to the field of aerial swarm robotics.	Semantic Scholar
Aerial swarms differ from swarms of ground-based vehicles in two major respects: Aerial robots or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operate in a three-dimensional space, and the dynamics of individual vehicles add an extra layer of complexity to the problems of path planning and trajectory design.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the success of aerial swarms is predicated on the distributed and synergistic capabilities of individual and cooperative control, estimation, and decision making of aerial robots with limited resources, such as modest onboard computation and sensing capabilities and size, weight, and power constraints.	Semantic Scholar
This special section, starting with the survey paper, presents recent advances in aerial swarm robotics, and aims to put together a cohesive set of research goals and visions toward realizing fully autonomous aerial swarm systems.	Semantic Scholar
One objective is to emphasize the three-way tradeoff among computational efficiency for large-scale swarms, stability, and robustness under uncertainty, and the optimal system performance.	Semantic Scholar
Learning from rewards generated by a human trainer observing an agent in action has been proven to be a powerful method for teaching autonomous agents to perform challenging tasks, especially for those non-technical users.	Semantic Scholar
Since the efficacy of this approach depends critically on the reward the trainer provides, we consider how the interaction between the trainer and the agent should be designed so as to increase the efficiency of the training process.	Semantic Scholar
This article investigates the influence of the agent’s socio-competitive feedback on the human trainer’s training behavior and the agent’s learning.	Semantic Scholar
The results of our user study with 85 participants suggest that the agent’s passive socio-competitive feedback—showing performance and score of agents trained by trainers in a leaderboard—substantially increases the engagement of the participants in the game task and improves the agents’ performance, even though the participants do not directly play the game but instead train the agent to do so.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, making this feedback active—sending the trainer her agent’s performance relative to others—further induces more participants to train agents longer and improves the agent’s learning.	Semantic Scholar
Our further analysis shows that agents trained by trainers affected by both the passive and active social feedback could obtain a higher performance under a score mechanism that could be optimized from the trainer’s perspective and the agent’s additional active social feedback can keep participants to further train agents to learn policies that can obtain a higher performance under such a score mechanism.

We address the problem of proof-search in the natural deduction calculus for Intuitionistic propositional logic.	Semantic Scholar
Our aim is to improve the usual proof-search procedure where introduction rules are applied upwards and elimination rules downwards.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we introduce $$\mathbf {Nbu} $$ Nbu , a variant of the usual natural deduction calculus for Intuitionistic Propositional Logic, and we show that it can be used as a base for a goal-oriented proof-search procedure.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that the implementation of our proof-search procedure is competitive with those based on sequent or tableaux calculi.	Semantic Scholar

Accurate causal inference among time series helps to better understand the interactive scheme behind the temporal variables.	Semantic Scholar
For time series analysis, an unavoidable issue is the existence of time lag among different temporal variables.	Semantic Scholar
That is, past evidence would take some time to cause a future effect instead of an immediate response.	Semantic Scholar
To model this process, existing approaches commonly adopt a prefixed time window to define the lag.	Semantic Scholar
However, in many real-world applications, this parameter may vary among different time series, and it is hard to be predefined with a fixed value.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose to learn the causal relations as well as the lag among different time series simultaneously from data.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we develop a probabilistic decomposed slab-and-spike (DSS) model to perform the inference by applying a pair of decomposed spike-and-slab variables for the model coefficients, where the first variable is used to estimate the causal relationship and the second one captures the lag information among different temporal variables.	Semantic Scholar
For parameter inference, we propose an efficient expectation propagation (EP) algorithm to solve the DSS model.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results conducted on both synthetic and real-world problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
The revealed time lag can be well validated by the domain knowledge within the real-world applications.	Semantic Scholar
The class of stencil programs involves repeatedly updating elements of arrays according to fixed patterns, referred to as stencils.	Semantic Scholar
Stencil problems are ubiquitous in scientific computing and are used as an ingredient to solve more involved problems.	Semantic Scholar
Their high regularity allows massive parallelization.	Semantic Scholar
Two important challenges in designing such algorithms are cache efficiency and minimizing the number of communication steps between nodes.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we introduce a mathematical framework for a crucial aspect of formal verification of both sequential and distributed stencil algorithms, and we describe its Coq implementation.	Semantic Scholar
We present a domain-specific embedded programming language with support for automating the most tedious steps of proofs that nested loops respect dependencies, applicable to sequential and distributed examples.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we evaluate the robustness of our library by proving the dependency-correctness of some real-world stencil algorithms, including a state-of-the-art cache-oblivious sequential algorithm, as well as two optimized distributed kernels.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we mainly propose a novel adaptive transductive label propagation approach by joint discriminative clustering on manifolds for representing and classifying high-dimensional data.	Semantic Scholar
Our framework seamlessly combines the unsupervised manifold learning, discriminative clustering and adaptive classification into a unified model.	Semantic Scholar
Also, our method incorporates the adaptive graph weight construction with label propagation.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, our method is capable of propagating label information using adaptive weights over low-dimensional manifold features, which is different from most existing studies that usually predict the labels and construct the weights in the original Euclidean space.	Semantic Scholar
For transductive classification by our formulation, we first perform the joint discriminative K-means clustering and manifold learning to capture the low-dimensional nonlinear manifolds.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we construct the adaptive weights over the learnt manifold features, where the adaptive weights are calculated through performing the joint minimization of the reconstruction errors over features and soft labels so that the graph weights can be joint-optimal for data representation and classification.	Semantic Scholar
Using the adaptive weights, we can easily estimate the unknown labels of samples.	Semantic Scholar
After that, our method returns the updated weights for further updating the manifold features.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive simulations on image classification and segmentation show that our proposed algorithm can deliver the state-of-the-art performance on several public datasets.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a dense method for estimating planar motion with a laser scanner.	Semantic Scholar
Starting from a symmetric representation of geometric consistency between scans, we derive a precise range flow constraint and express the motion of the scan observations as a function of the rigid motion of the scanner.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to existing techniques, which align the incoming scan with either the previous one or the last selected keyscan, we propose a combined and efficient formulation to jointly align all these three scans at every iteration.	Semantic Scholar
This new formulation preserves the advantages of keyscan-based strategies but, is more robust against suboptimal selection of keyscans and the presence of moving objects.	Semantic Scholar
An extensive evaluation of our method is presented with simulated and real data in both static and dynamic environments.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that our approach is one order of magnitude faster and significantly more accurate than existing methods in all the conducted experiments.	Semantic Scholar
With a runtime of about one millisecond, it is suitable for those robotic applications that require planar odometry with low computational cost.	Semantic Scholar
The code is available online as a ROS package.	Semantic Scholar
The fingerprint is a morphological aspect of the human fingertip that has interesting implications for our sense of touch.	Semantic Scholar
Previous studies focused on how the fingerprint affects the perception of stimuli that excite high temporal frequencies, such as for texture perception.	Semantic Scholar
These studies also only add papillary ridges to their sensors.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we endow a biomimetic sensor with both papillary ridges (fingerprint) and a dermal stiffness contrast (stiffer intermediate ridges), and assess the impact on localization perception accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
The sensor is based on a novel modular version of a three-dimensional printed tactile sensor (TacTip).	Semantic Scholar
Tactile data were collected with these tips on nine stimuli with varying curvature.	Semantic Scholar
The location perception acuity of three tips [smooth, fingerprint, and fingerprint (cores)] were compared with a probabilistic classification method, finding that both fingerprinted tips increase the perceptual acuity of small spatial scales.	Semantic Scholar
Interestingly, the fingerprint variant had poorer accuracy than the smooth tip for larger spatial scales; however, adding cores to enhance the dermal stiffness counteracted the degradation of accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
This supports the theories that the fingerprint aids the classification of edges and smaller spatial scales, and demonstrates that the addition of a fingerprint to an artificial tactile sensors improves its acuity.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a biomimetic underwater soft robot design with novel propulsion and maneuvering mechanisms.	Semantic Scholar
The robot design took inspirations from cephalopod molluscs.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed robot comprises a soft mantle structure with multiple built-in soft actuators, which could deform to provide steering and maneuverability for underwater locomotion.	Semantic Scholar
Smart sensors are embedded into the soft mantle to provide real-time feedback to the controller.	Semantic Scholar
Underwater thrust is generated by a novel vortex-based soft tail mechanism also inspired by molluscs.	Semantic Scholar
The tail mechanism incorporates an electric motor sealed inside a continuum chamber, and rotational motion from the motor is transmitted to the soft-bodied tentacles, which generate a vortex to produce thrust.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting soft robot is incorporated in a seamless body, while both propulsion and steering are generated by soft-body deformation.	Semantic Scholar
To investigate the novel vortex-based biomimetic propulsion generation mechanism, an analytical model was developed to capture the relation between input motor speed and the resulting thrust force.	Semantic Scholar
The entire robot was fabricated using 3-D-printing and soft-material molding.	Semantic Scholar
The fabricated robot components and the assembled system were both validated through experiments.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that the mollusk-inspired robot could achieve underwater maneuverability by bending the four actuators, and the measured results match well with the proposed analytical mode.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed design could easily be repeated by anyone with access to a consumer-grade 3-D printer, enabling a wide range of biomimetic robot enthusiasts to investigate in the new mechanism for underwater propulsion and maneuvering.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we develop a novel optimal control strategy for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems with unmatched interconnections.	Semantic Scholar
To begin with, we present a stabilizing feedback controller for the interconnected nonlinear systems by modifying an array of optimal control laws of auxiliary subsystems.	Semantic Scholar
We also prove that this feedback controller ensures a specified cost function to achieve optimality.	Semantic Scholar
Then, under the framework of adaptive critic designs, we use critic networks to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations associated with auxiliary subsystem optimal control laws.	Semantic Scholar
The critic network weights are tuned through the gradient descent method combined with an additional stabilizing term.	Semantic Scholar
By using the newly established weight tuning rules, we no longer need the initial admissible control condition.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we demonstrate that all signals in the closed-loop auxiliary subsystems are stable in the sense of uniform ultimate boundedness by using classic Lyapunov techniques.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we provide an interconnected nonlinear plant to validate the present control scheme.	Semantic Scholar
Schema Matching (SM) and Record Matching (RM) are two necessary steps in integrating multiple relational tables of different schemas, where SM unifies the schemas and RM detects records referring to the same real-world entity.	Semantic Scholar
The two processes have been thoroughly studied separately, but few attention has been paid to the interaction of SM and RM.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we find that, even alternating them in a simple manner, SM and RM can benefit from each other to reach a better integration performance (i.e., in terms of precision and recall).	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, combining SM and RM is a promising solution for improving data integration.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we define novel matching rules for SM and RM, respectively, that is, every SM decision is made based on intermediate RM results, and vice versa, such that SM and RM can be performed alternately.	Semantic Scholar
The quality of integration is guaranteed by a Matching Likelihood Estimation model and the control of semantic drift, which prevent the effect of mismatch magnification.	Semantic Scholar
To reduce the computational cost, we design an index structure based on q-grams and a greedy search algorithm that can reduce around 90 percent overhead of the interaction.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on three data collections show that the combination and interaction between SM and RM significantly outperforms previous works that conduct SM and RM separately.	Semantic Scholar

The ability to train a network without memorizing the input/output data, thereby allowing a good predictive performance when applied to unseen data, is paramount in ANN applications.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a frequency-domain approach to evaluate the network initialization in terms of quality of training, i.e., generalization capabilities.	Semantic Scholar
As an alternative to the conventional time-domain methods, the proposed approach eliminates the approximate nature of network validation using an excess of unseen data.	Semantic Scholar
The benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated using two numerical examples, where two trained networks performed similarly on the training and the validation data sets, yet they revealed a significant difference in prediction accuracy when tested using a different data set.	Semantic Scholar
This observation is of utmost importance in modeling applications requiring a high degree of accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
The efficiency of the proposed approach is further demonstrated on a real-world problem, where unlike other initialization methods, a more conclusive assessment of generalization is achieved.	Semantic Scholar
On the practical front, subtle methodological and implementational facets are addressed to ensure reproducibility and pinpoint the limitations of the proposed approach.	Semantic Scholar
The humanoid robot David is equipped with a novel robotic neck based on an elastic continuum mechanism (ECM).	Semantic Scholar
To realize a model-based motion control, the six dimensional stiffness characteristics needs to be known.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents an approach to experimentally identify the stiffness characteristic using a robot manipulator to deflect the ECM and measure the Cartesian wrenches and Cartesian poses with external sensors.	Semantic Scholar
A three-step process is proposed to establish Cartesian wrench and pose pairs experimentally.	Semantic Scholar
The process consists of a simulation step, to select a good model, a second step that extracts effective poses from workspace which are sampled experimentally and the third step, the pose sampling procedure in which the robot drives the ECM to these effective poses.	Semantic Scholar
A full cubic polynomial regression model is adopted based on simulation data to fit the stiffness characteristics.	Semantic Scholar
To extract the poses to be sampled in the experiments, two different approaches are evaluated and compared to ensure a well-posed identification.	Semantic Scholar
The identification process on the hardware is performed by using Cartesian impedance and inverse kinematics control in combination to comply with the physical constraints imposed by the ECM.	Semantic Scholar
Micromanipulation plays a key role in the development of complex and assembled microsystems.	Semantic Scholar
However, current micromanipulation solutions are often limited to small rotation amplitudes and to simple shaped objects (such as cubes).	Semantic Scholar
Our approach consists of developing in-hand micromanipulation techniques using dexterous microhands to manipulate arbitrary shaped objects and to perform large rotations.	Semantic Scholar
This paper focuses on the trajectory generation of a dexterous microhand to achieve automated repositioning by taking advantage of adhesion forces.	Semantic Scholar
The results on the generated trajectories show that adhesion forces can be exploited to enhance the manipulation possibilities.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, experiments show that planed rotations are performed at more than  $\text{95}\%$ using an open-loop control.	Semantic Scholar
Dexterous micromanipulation is a promising way to perform complex manipulation tasks in microscale.	Semantic Scholar
Clusters retrieved by generic Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) networks are limited to their internal categorical representation.	Semantic Scholar
This study extends the capabilities of ART by incorporating multiple vigilance thresholds in a single network: stricter (data compression) and looser (cluster similarity) vigilance values are used to obtain a many-to-one mapping of categories-to-clusters.	Semantic Scholar
It demonstrates this idea in the context of Fuzzy ART, presented as Dual Vigilance Fuzzy ART (DVFA), to improve the ability to capture clusters with arbitrary geometry.	Semantic Scholar
DVFA outperformed Fuzzy ART for the datasets in our experiments while yielding a statistically-comparable performance to another more complex, multi-prototype Fuzzy ART-based architecture.	Semantic Scholar
Over the last decades, several studies have demonstrated the importance of co-clustering to simultaneously produce groups of objects and features.	Semantic Scholar
Even to obtain object clusters only, using co-clustering is often more effective than one-way clustering, especially when considering sparse high dimensional data.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a novel generative mixture model for co-clustering such data.	Semantic Scholar
This model, the Sparse Poisson Latent Block Model (SPLBM), is based on the Poisson distribution, which arises naturally for contingency tables, such as document-term matrices.	Semantic Scholar
The advantages of SPLBM are two-fold.	Semantic Scholar
First, it is a rigorous statistical model which is also very parsimonious.	Semantic Scholar
Second, it has been designed from the ground up to deal with data sparsity problems.	Semantic Scholar
As a consequence, in addition to seeking homogeneous blocks, as other available algorithms, it also filters out homogeneous but noisy ones due to the sparsity of the data.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on various datasets of different size and structure show that an algorithm based on SPLBM clearly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Most notably, the SPLBM-based algorithm presented here succeeds in retrieving the natural cluster structure of difficult, unbalanced datasets which other known algorithms are unable to handle effectively.	Semantic Scholar
Funneling and saltation are the two major illusory feedback techniques employed by vibrotactile feedback.	Semantic Scholar
They elicit the sensation of a vibrotactile stimulus outside the user's body, originating from an externally held object that visually extends the body.	Semantic Scholar
This paper examines the synergy of associating the out-of-body illusory tactile sensation with different visual feedback to improve the user experience for interacting with the augmented virtual objects.	Semantic Scholar
There are two important types of visual feedback: the rendering of a “body-extending” object (that appears attached to and connecting the two fingertips to create the illusion) and “interaction” with the object itself (with which the user interacts).	Semantic Scholar
Two experiments were performed, for funneling and saltation, assessing the perceptual effects under four associated visual feedback conditions: with 1) no visual feedback, 2) a body-extending virtual object, 3) a virtual interaction object (rendered at the illusion target location) and 4) both the body-extending and interaction virtual objects.	Semantic Scholar
We hypothesized that rendering a body-extending object will maintain an important role in eliciting the illusion itself, while showing the actual interaction object will improve user performance and experience through multimodal integration.	Semantic Scholar
Our findings indicated that the effect of the interaction object was much stronger than that of the body extension.	Semantic Scholar
In the case of funneling, the visual body extension was not even necessary to elicit the out-of-body sensation.	Semantic Scholar
The effect of the body extension was marginal for funneling.	Semantic Scholar
These findings can be applied to tactile interaction design using only few actuators on a variety of media platforms including augmented content.	Semantic Scholar
Information needs to be appropriately encoded to be reliably transmitted over physical media.	Semantic Scholar
Similarly, neurons have their own codes to convey information in the brain.	Semantic Scholar
Even though it is well-known that neurons exchange information using a pool of several protocols of spatio-temporal encodings, the suitability of each code and their performance as a function of network parameters and external stimuli is still one of the great mysteries in neuroscience.	Semantic Scholar
This paper sheds light on this by modeling small-size networks of chemically and electrically coupled Hindmarsh-Rose spiking neurons.	Semantic Scholar
We focus on a class of temporal and firing-rate codes that result from neurons' membrane-potentials and phases, and quantify numerically their performance estimating the Mutual Information Rate, aka the rate of information exchange.	Semantic Scholar
Our results suggest that the firing-rate and interspike-intervals codes are more robust to additive Gaussian white noise.	Semantic Scholar
In a network of four interconnected neurons and in the absence of such noise, pairs of neurons that have the largest rate of information exchange using the interspike-intervals and firing-rate codes are not adjacent in the network, whereas spike-timings and phase codes (temporal) promote large rate of information exchange for adjacent neurons.	Semantic Scholar
If that result would have been possible to extend to larger neural networks, it would suggest that small microcircuits would preferably exchange information using temporal codes (spike-timings and phase codes), whereas on the macroscopic scale, where there would be typically pairs of neurons not directly connected due to the brain's sparsity, firing-rate and interspike-intervals codes would be the most efficient codes.	Semantic Scholar
Generalization is an effective technique for protecting confidential information of individuals, and has been studied by proposing numerous algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
However, the previous works do not separate the protection against identity disclosure and sensitive disclosure.	Semantic Scholar
"Thus, when the requirement of attribute protection is higher than that of identity protection, generalization for <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$l$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""zhang-ieq1-2773069.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula>-diversity causes overprotection for identity and large mounts of information utility loss."	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a novel approach, called cross-bucket generalization, as a solution to meet the problem.	Semantic Scholar
The rationale is to divide microdata into equivalence groups and buckets.	Semantic Scholar
First, it provides separate protection for identity and sensitive values, and the level of protection can be flexibly adjusted based on actual demands.	Semantic Scholar
Second, the sizes of equivalence groups and buckets are minimized as far as possible by only satisfying the protection requirements, which avoid the overprotection for identity and reduce information loss.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments we conducted illustrate the effectiveness of our solution.	Semantic Scholar
Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) often exhibit impairments in communication and social interaction, and thus face various social challenges in collaborative activities.	Semantic Scholar
Given the cost of ASD intervention and lack of access to trained clinicians, technology-assisted ASD intervention has gained momentum in recent years.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a novel collaborative virtual environment (CVE)-based social interaction platform for ASD intervention.	Semantic Scholar
The development of CVE technology for ASD intervention may lead to the creation of a novel low-cost intervention environment that will foster collaboration with peers and provide flexibility in communication.	Semantic Scholar
The presented Communication-Enhancement CVE system, hand-in-hand, allows two children to play a series of interactive games in a virtual reality environment by using simple hand gestures to collaboratively move virtual objects that are tracked in real time via cameras.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, these games are designed to promote natural communication and cooperation between the users via the presented Communication-Enhancement mode that allows users to share information and discuss game strategies using gaze and voice-based communication.	Semantic Scholar
The results of a feasibility study with 12 children with ASD and 12 typically developing peers show that this system was well accepted by both the children with and without ASD, improved their cooperation in game play, and demonstrated the potential for fostering their communication and collaboration skills.

Finding the shortest path in road networks becomes one of important issues in location based services (LBS).	Semantic Scholar
The problem of finding the optimal meeting point for a group of users has also been well studied in existing works.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we investigate a new problem for two users.	Semantic Scholar
Each user has his/her own source and destination.	Semantic Scholar
However, whether to meet before going to their destinations is with some uncertainty.	Semantic Scholar
"We model it as minimum path pair (<italic> MPP</italic>) query, which consists of two pairs of source and destination and a user-specified weight <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\alpha$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""shang-ieq1-2777851.gif""/> </alternatives></inline-formula> to balance the two different needs."	Semantic Scholar
The result is a pair of paths connecting the two sources and destinations respectively, with minimal overall cost of the two paths and the shortest route between them.	Semantic Scholar
To solve <italic>MPP</italic> queries, we devise algorithms by enumerating node pairs.	Semantic Scholar
We adopt a location-based pruning strategy to reduce the number of node pairs for enumeration.	Semantic Scholar
An efficient algorithm based on point-to-point shortest path calculation is proposed to further improve query efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
We also give two fast approximate algorithms with approximation bounds.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.	Semantic Scholar
The commercial use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) would be enhanced by an ability to sense and avoid potential mid-air collision threats.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a new approach to aircraft detection for long-range vision-based sense and avoid.	Semantic Scholar
We first train a deep convolutional neural network to learn aircraft visual features using flight data of mid-air head-on near-collision course encounters between two fixed-wing aircraft.	Semantic Scholar
We then propose an approach that fuses these learnt aircraft features with hand-crafted features that are used by the current state of the art.	Semantic Scholar
"Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed approach on real flight data captured from a UAV, where it achieves a mean detection range of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\text{2527}$</tex-math></inline-formula>  m and a mean detection range improvement of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\text{299}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> m (or <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\text{13.4}\%$</tex-math></inline-formula>) compared to the current state of the art with no additional false alarms."

Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), performed through a small number of keyhole incisions, has become the standard of care for many general surgical procedures, reducing trauma, blood loss, and other complications and offering patients the prospect of a faster recovery with less postoperative pain.	Semantic Scholar
These improvements for the patient, however, require higher dexterity and complex instrument control by the surgeons.	Semantic Scholar
Keyhole incisions constrain the motion of surgical instruments, while the loss of stereovision when using a laparoscope or endoscope means that depth perception is much poorer than in traditional open surgery.	Semantic Scholar
The desire to tackle these issues has been the main driver behind the development of robotic MIS systems with stereovision.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the da Vinci robot (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, California) is a successful surgical platform, used widely in the treatment of gynecological and urological cancers.	Semantic Scholar
While human guidance is essential for MIS, recent studies [1] have suggested that automation of some surgical subtasks, particularly those that are tedious and repetitive or require high precision, can be beneficial in improving accuracy and reducing the cognitive load of the surgeon.	Semantic Scholar
For example, several studies have investigated automation of surgical suturing subtasks, including using a suturing tool under fluorescence guidance [2], and other studies have explored areas such as autonomous tissue dissection [3].	Semantic Scholar
Fractional order PID is a regulator of choice in dealingwith systemuncertainties.	Semantic Scholar
In a typical FOPID design, a simple approximate model of the linearized system is derived and by making, the derivative of the open loop phase versus frequency at crossover frequency zero, flat phase margin is obtained.	Semantic Scholar
Themethod tolerates system gain uncertainty and involves two set of nonlinear computations: model approximation and five-parameter FOPID calculations.	Semantic Scholar
The method shows flaws where severe uncertainty occurs in the form of gain and poles–zeros locations.	Semantic Scholar
In this respect, a modified design method is suggested to prevent performance degradation.	Semantic Scholar
Using Monte Carlo simulation, the plot of distribution of open loop system phase margins versus crossover frequencies is drawn.	Semantic Scholar
Instead of approximate modeling, several frequencies at the crossover band are marked and their average phase margins from the distribution plot are picked to represent the real uncertain system.	Semantic Scholar
Calculations of the FOPID parameters are carried out using nonlinear optimization method to make phase plot flat around the crossover frequency.	Semantic Scholar
The design sequence is detailed by applying to the roll control of a small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) where often rough approximates of its aerodynamic parameters are available.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown that the proposed design outperforms the conventionally designed FOPID and definitely PID in leading the roll, yaw and pitch motion in a very coherent manner.	Semantic Scholar
This is confirmed in this case by extensive simulations.	Semantic Scholar

The most tight intractability results for graph-based Multirobot Path Planning (MPP), proven recently, state that time-optimal and distance-optimal MPP problems are NP-hard on planar graphs.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we go one step further for what concerns the time-optimal objectives, and prove that such problems remain NP-hard when restricting the planar graph to a 2D grid graph with holes, which is a discretization widely used in robotics.	Semantic Scholar

The high resolution point cloud collected six months ago is provided from Singapore Land Authority around One-north area in Singapore, because the data are outdated there are many changed aspects of the environment such as redrawn road markings, construction areas, and changing tree shapes.	Semantic Scholar
In response, this paper proposes a novel fusion algorithm based on a particle filter using vertical and road intensity information for robust localization.	Semantic Scholar
Whereas the state-of-the-art fusion algorithm focus on optimization of the vehicle pose based on multiple measurements, the proposed method estimates a robust vehicle pose by considering the reliability of each feature from the prior map.	Semantic Scholar
We also propose an efficient management strategy of a grid map that includes multilayer vertical and road intensity information for real-time operation.	Semantic Scholar
A sensor system equipped on a vehicle consists of 32 channels of 3D Light Detection And Ranging, IMU, wheel odometry, which are used for the proposed algorithm.	Semantic Scholar

The proposed algorithm overcomes specific challenges associated with deliverable underwater acoustic SLAM, including feature sparsity and false-positive data association when utilizing sonar imagery.	Semantic Scholar
An advanced machine learning technique is used to provide saliency-aware loop closure proposals.	Semantic Scholar
A more reliable data association approach using different available constraints is also developed.	Semantic Scholar
Our evaluation is presented on the real-world data collected in a ship hull inspection application, which illustrates the system's performance and robustness.	Semantic Scholar
Spectral clustering has been playing a vital role in various research areas.	Semantic Scholar
Most traditional spectral clustering algorithms comprise two independent stages (e.g., first learning continuous labels and then rounding the learned labels into discrete ones), which may cause unpredictable deviation of resultant cluster labels from genuine ones, thereby leading to severe information loss and performance degradation.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we study how to achieve discrete clustering as well as reliably generalize to unseen data.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel spectral clustering scheme which deeply explores cluster label properties, including discreteness, nonnegativity, and discrimination, as well as learns robust out-of-sample prediction functions.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we explicitly enforce a discrete transformation on the intermediate continuous labels, which leads to a tractable optimization problem with a discrete solution.	Semantic Scholar
Besides, we preserve the natural nonnegative characteristic of the clustering labels to enhance the interpretability of the results.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, to further compensate the unreliability of the learned clustering labels, we integrate an adaptive robust module with $\ell _{2,p}$  loss to learn prediction function for grouping unseen data.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that the out-of-sample component can inject discriminative knowledge into the learning of cluster labels under certain conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments conducted on various data sets have demonstrated the superiority of our proposal as compared to several existing clustering approaches.	Semantic Scholar
This paper deals with the finite-time synchronization problem for a class of uncertain coupled switched neural networks under asynchronous switching.	Semantic Scholar
By constructing appropriate Lyapunov-like functionals and using the average dwell time technique, some sufficient criteria are derived to guarantee the finite-time synchronization of considered uncertain coupled switched neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
Meanwhile, the asynchronous switching feedback controller is designed to finite-time synchronize the concerned networks.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, two numerical examples are introduced to show the validity of the main results.	Semantic Scholar
In modern robotic applications, tactile sensor arrays (i.e., artificial skins) are an emergent solution to determine the locations of contacts between a robot and an external agent.	Semantic Scholar
Localizing the point of contact is useful but determining the force applied on the skin provides many additional possibilities.	Semantic Scholar
This additional feature usually requires time-consuming calibration procedures to relate the sensor readings to the applied forces.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a novel device that enables the calibration of tactile sensor arrays in a fast and simple way.	Semantic Scholar
The key idea is to design a plenum chamber where the skin is inserted, and then the calibration of the tactile sensors is achieved by relating the air pressure and the sensor readings.	Semantic Scholar
This general concept is tested experimentally to calibrate the skin of the iCub robot.	Semantic Scholar
The validation of the calibration device is achieved by placing the masses of known weight on the artificial skin and comparing the applied force against the one estimated by the sensors.	Semantic Scholar
This article offers a formal account of curiosity and insight in terms of active (Bayesian) inference.	Semantic Scholar
It deals with the dual problem of inferring states of the world and learning its statistical structure.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to current trends in machine learning (e.g., deep learning), we focus on how people attain insight and understanding using just a handful of observations, which are solicited through curious behavior.	Semantic Scholar
We use simulations of abstract rule learning and approximate Bayesian inference to show that minimizing (expected) variational free energy leads to active sampling of novel contingencies.	Semantic Scholar
This epistemic behavior closes explanatory gaps in generative models of the world, thereby reducing uncertainty and satisfying curiosity.	Semantic Scholar
We then move from epistemic learning to model selection or structure learning to show how abductive processes emerge when agents test plausible hypotheses about symmetries (i.e., invariances or rules) in their generative models.	Semantic Scholar
The ensuing Bayesian model reduction evinces mechanisms associated with sleep and has all the hallmarks of “aha” moments.	Semantic Scholar
This formulation moves toward a computational account of consciousness in the pre-Cartesian sense of sharable knowledge (i.e., con: “together”; scire: “to know”).	Semantic Scholar
This paper studies the multivehicle task assignment problem where several dispersed vehicles need to visit a set of target locations in a time-invariant drift field while trying to minimize the total travel time.	Semantic Scholar
Using optimal control theory, we first design a path planning algorithm to minimize the time for each vehicle to travel between two given locations in the drift field.	Semantic Scholar
The path planning algorithm provides the cost matrix for the target assignment, and generates routes once the target locations are assigned to a vehicle.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we propose several clustering strategies to assign the targets, and we use two metrics to determine the visiting sequence of the targets clustered to each vehicle.	Semantic Scholar
Mainly used to specify the minimum time for a vehicle to travel between any two target locations, the cost matrix is obtained using the path planning algorithm, and is in general asymmetric due to time-invariant currents of the drift field.	Semantic Scholar
We show that one of the clustering strategies can obtain a min-cost arborescence of the asymmetric target-vehicle graph where the weight of a directed edge between two vertices is the minimum travel time from one vertex to the other respecting the orientation.	Semantic Scholar
Using tools from graph theory, a lower bound on the optimal solution is found, which can be used to measure the proximity of a solution from the optimal.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, by integrating the target clustering strategies with the target visiting metrics, we obtain several task assignment algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Among them, two algorithms guarantee that all the target locations will be visited within a computable maximal travel time, which is at most twice of the optimal when the cost matrix is symmetric.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, numerical simulations show that the algorithms can quickly lead to a solution that is close to the optimal.	Semantic Scholar
The human hand is able to achieve an unparalleled diversity of manipulation actions.	Semantic Scholar
One contributor to this capability is the structure of the human finger pad, where soft internal tissue is surrounded by a layer of more rigid skin.	Semantic Scholar
This permits conforming of the finger pad around object contours for firm grasping, while also permitting low-friction sliding over object surfaces with a light touch.	Semantic Scholar
These varying modes of manipulation contribute to the common ability for in-hand-manipulation, where an object (such as a car key) may repositioned relative to the palm.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a simple mechanical analogy to the human finger pad, via a robotic finger with both high- and low-friction surfaces.	Semantic Scholar
The low-friction surface is suspended on elastic elements and recesses into a cavity when a sufficient normal force is applied (∼1.2 to 2.5 N depending on contact location), exposing the high-friction surface.	Semantic Scholar
We implement one “variable friction” finger and one “constant friction” finger on a 2-DOF gripper with a simple torque controller.	Semantic Scholar
With this setup, we demonstrate how within-hand rolling and sliding of an object may be achieved without the need for tactile sensing, high-dexterity, dynamic finger/object modeling, or complex control methods.	Semantic Scholar
The addition of an actuator to the finger design allows controlled switching between variable-friction and constant-friction modes, enabling precise object translation and reorientation within a grasp, via simple motion sequences.	Semantic Scholar
The rolling and sliding behaviors are characterized with experimentally verified geometric models.	Semantic Scholar
A method that uses an adaptive learning rate is presented for training neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike most conventional updating methods in which the learning rate gradually decreases during training, the proposed method increases or decreases the learning rate adaptively so that the training loss (the sum of cross-entropy losses for all training samples) decreases as much as possible.	Semantic Scholar
It thus provides a wider search range for solutions and thus a lower test error rate.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments with some well-known datasets to train a multilayer perceptron show that the proposed method is effective for obtaining a better test accuracy under certain conditions.	Semantic Scholar
This paper investigates an important problem in stream mining, i.e., classification under streaming emerging new classes or SENC.	Semantic Scholar
The SENC problem can be decomposed into three subproblems: detecting emerging new classes, classifying known classes, and updating models to integrate each new class as part of known classes.	Semantic Scholar
The common approach is to treat it as a classification problem and solve it using either a supervised learner or a semi-supervised learner.	Semantic Scholar
We propose an alternative approach by using unsupervised learning as the basis to solve this problem.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method employs completely-random trees which have been shown to work well in unsupervised learning and supervised learning independently in the literature.	Semantic Scholar
The completely-random trees are used as a single common core to solve all three subproblems: unsupervised learning, supervised learning, and model update on data streams.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the proposed unsupervised-learning-focused method often achieves significantly better outcomes than existing classification-focused methods.	Semantic Scholar
It is well known that, by properly selecting the measurement configurations in robot calibrations, the observability index of unknown parameters can be maximized, leading to high calibration accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
For this purpose, many configuration-search methods were proposed.	Semantic Scholar
However, the established methods were mainly based on derivative-free or metaheuristic techniques, whose computational costs were high.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the robustness of observability index and convergences of configuration searches were not investigated.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, by extending a recent result in matrix perturbation theory to robot kinematics, we establish the closed-form mapping from configuration perturbations to singular-value variations.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this mapping, an efficient configuration-search method is proposed, the robustness of the observability index under bounded configuration perturbations is analyzed, and the convergence of configuration searches is studied.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed methods were validated by simulations on serial and parallel robots.	Semantic Scholar
With roughly estimated initial parameters, self-calibration experiments on a redundant cable-driven parallel robot were performed.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated by the experiment results.	Semantic Scholar
Sampling-based kinodynamic planners, such as rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs), pose two fundamental challenges: computing a reliable (pseudo-)metric for the distance between two random nodes, and computing a steering input to connect the nodes.	Semantic Scholar
The core of these challenges is a two point boundary value problem, known to be NP-hard.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, the distance metric has been approximated using supervised learning, reducing computation time drastically.	Semantic Scholar
Previous work on such learning RRTs use direct optimal control to generate the data for supervised learning.	Semantic Scholar
This letter proposes to use indirect optimal control instead, because it provides two benefits: it reduces the computational effort to generate the data, and it provides a low-dimensional parametrization of the action space.	Semantic Scholar
The latter allows us to learn both the distance metric and the steering input.	Semantic Scholar
This eliminates the need for a local planner in learning RRTs.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results on a pendulum swing up show tenfold speed-up in both the offline data generation and the online planning time.	Semantic Scholar
While recent advancements in using sophisticated onboard sensors on robotic platforms has made it possible to consign various tasks like exploration, mapping, and flocking to teams of mobile robots, some issues like handling extensive amount of data, high dependency on sensors’ performance, and high expenses emerge.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, the problem of mapping unknown environments by a team of heterogeneous mobile robots with limited and inexpensive sensing abilities is addressed.	Semantic Scholar
The concepts of Information Space and sensor models have been employed to plan the motions of robots with limited sensory data in order to accomplish the common goal of mapping the entire workspace as complete as possible.	Semantic Scholar
Also, a cooperation architecture is proposed to fuse and interrelate the dissimilar data obtained by individual heterogeneous robots and allocate various exploratory tasks to each of them in order to complete the map.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm works with various limited sensing model, such as depth-limited boundary distance sensor, quadridirectional depth sensor, depth-limited gap sensor, and depth-limited radially-bounded depth senor.	Semantic Scholar
Based on each sensor model, the best moving strategy is introduced to maximize the workspace coverage for each robot.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed algorithm, which yields a geometric map of the environment, is implemented in diverse simulated problems both with and without sensing noises, and the results and comparisons with a recent related work show that it is able to reliably construct maps of simply-connected and multiply-connected environments with convex and concave obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
In presence of noises, the produced maps had about 12.4% false positive and 3.3% false negative errors on average.	Semantic Scholar
Also, some sensitivity analyses are done on the effects of workspace size and number of robots on the mapping time.	Semantic Scholar
With the rapid development of big data analytics, mobile computing, Internet of Things, cloud computing, and social networking, cyberspace has expanded to a cross-fused and ubiquitous space made up of human beings, things, and information.	Semantic Scholar
Internet applications have evolved from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 and Web 3.0, and web information has seen an explosive growth, which is strongly promoting the advent of a global era of big data.	Semantic Scholar
In this ubiquitous cyberspace, traditional search engines can no longer fully satisfy the evolving needs of various types of users.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, search engines must make completely innovative, revolutionary changes for the next generation of search, which is referred to as “big search”.	Semantic Scholar
This paper first studies the development needs of big search.	Semantic Scholar
Then, big search is defined, and the 5S properties (Sourcing, Sensing, Synthesizing, Solution, and Security) of big search, which are different from those of traditional search engines, are elaborated.	Semantic Scholar
Also, the paper provides a system architecture for big search, explores the key technologies that support the 5S properties, and describes potential application fields of big search technology.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the research opportunities of big search are discussed.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper the classic momentum algorithm for stochastic optimization is considered.	Semantic Scholar
A method is introduced that adjusts coefficients for this algorithm during its operation.	Semantic Scholar
The method does not depend on any preliminary knowledge of the optimization problem.	Semantic Scholar
In the experimental study, the method is applied to on-line learning in feed-forward neural networks, including deep auto-encoders, and outperforms any fixed coefficients.	Semantic Scholar
The method eliminates coefficients that are difficult to determine, with profound influence on performance.	Semantic Scholar
While the method itself has some coefficients, they are ease to determine and sensitivity of performance to them is low.	Semantic Scholar
Consequently, the method makes on-line learning a practically parameter-free process and broadens the area of potential application of this technology.	Semantic Scholar
This study describes a novel active rotary-legs mechanism for a stair-climbing mobility vehicle.	Semantic Scholar
We have previously developed a stair-climbing up and down wheelchair with lever propelled rotary-legs operated using the human upper body.	Semantic Scholar
The previous results indicated that the required torque for the stair-climbing up and down procedure can be reduced based on the user's posture transition, which was achieved via the procedure using only the human upper body.	Semantic Scholar
The design principle of the proposed active rotary-legs mechanism in this study is to develop a more compact and lightweight mechanism for a stair-climbing up and down mobility vehicle.	Semantic Scholar
We achieve this objective based on the previous observations by appropriately combining the active and passive components.	Semantic Scholar
The developed mechanism consists of a four-bar linkage mechanism with motors and gas springs as active and passive components, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
The gas springs are connected to the linkage mechanism as parallel elastic actuators, which can reduce the required motor torque and make the complete mechanism compact and lightweight.	Semantic Scholar
We describe herein a detailed design of the active rotary-legs mechanism and conduct simulations and preliminary experiments to investigate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.	Semantic Scholar
A lower-back exoskeleton prototype designed to provide back support for industrial workers who manually handle heavy materials is presented in this article.	Semantic Scholar
Reducing spinal loads during these tasks can reduce the risk of work-related back injuries.	Semantic Scholar
Biomechanical studies show that compression of the lumbar spine is a key risk factor for musculoskeletal injuries.	Semantic Scholar
To address this issue, we present a wearable exoskeleton designed to provide back support and reduce lumbar spine compression.	Semantic Scholar
To provide effective assistance and avoid injury to muscles or tendons, we apply a continuous torque of approximately 40 Nm on both hip joints to actively assist both hip abduction/adduction (HAA) and hip flexion/extension (HFE).	Semantic Scholar
Each actuation unit includes a modular and a compact series-elastic actuator (SEA) with a clutch.	Semantic Scholar
The SEA provides mechanical compliance at the interface between the exoskeleton and the user, and the clutches can automatically disengage the torque between the exoskeleton and the user.	Semantic Scholar
These experimental results show that the exoskeleton can lower lumbar compression by reducing the need for muscular activity in the spine.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, powering both HFE and HAA can effectively reduce the lumbar spinal loading user experience when lifting and lowering objects while in a twisted posture.	Semantic Scholar
The extreme complexity of the brain has attracted the attention of neuroscientists and other researchers for a long time.	Semantic Scholar
More recently, the neuromorphic hardware has matured to provide a new powerful tool to study neuronal dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we study neuronal dynamics using different settings on a neuromorphic chip built with flexible parameters of neuron models.	Semantic Scholar
Our unique setting in the network of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons is to introduce a weak noise environment.	Semantic Scholar
We observed three different types of collective neuronal activities, or phases, separated by sharp boundaries, or phase transitions.	Semantic Scholar
From this, we construct a rudimentary phase diagram of neuronal dynamics and demonstrate that a noise-induced chaotic phase (N-phase), which is dominated by neuronal avalanche activity (intermittent aperiodic neuron firing), emerges in the presence of noise and its width grows with the noise intensity.	Semantic Scholar
The dynamics can be manipulated in this N-phase.	Semantic Scholar
Our results and comparison with clinical data is consistent with the literature and our previous work showing that healthy brain must reside in the N-phase.	Semantic Scholar
We argue that the brain phase diagram with further refinement may be used for the diagnosis and treatment of mental disease and also suggest that the dynamics may be manipulated to serve as a means of new information processing (e.g., for optimization).	Semantic Scholar
Neuromorphic chips, similar to the one we used but with a variety of neuron models, may be used to further enhance the understanding of human brain function and accelerate the development of neuroscience research.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose an online hashing tracking method with a further exploitation of spatiotemporal saliency for template sampling.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, spatio-temporal saliency is firstly explored to make the sampled templates contain true object templates as much as possible.	Semantic Scholar
Then, different from the previous batch modes for hashing, the hashing function in this work is online learned by new pairs of collected templates received sequentially, in which the relationship between the positive templates and negative templates can be appropriately preserved that is more useful for visual tracking.	Semantic Scholar
With the hash coding for templates, the between-frame matching can be efficiently conducted.	Semantic Scholar
Besides, this work further builds a positive template pool as a memory buffer for object depiction, in which representative truly positive target templates are gathered and utilized to restrain the degradation of the appearance model due to the error accommodation in online hashing.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our tracker performs favorably against the state-of-the-art ones.	Semantic Scholar

In this letter, we present a passive spine gripper that can hold rough rocky surfaces of boulders on cliff walls, and we discuss its application to a four-limbed robot for free-climbing in extreme terrain.	Semantic Scholar
The limbed robot has four degrees of freedom in each limb, where three are to drive joints of the limb and one for releasing the gripper.	Semantic Scholar
The fine spine of the proposed gripper also enables it to passively and adaptively latch on to microscopic asperities of the rough surface, and it is thus an efficient mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present the fundamental design and mechanism of the proposed gripper, after which we introduce its static gripping model.	Semantic Scholar
We verify the gripping model by the experimental gripping performance of the prototype gripper.	Semantic Scholar
We show a lightweight four-limbed robot that is equipped with the grippers mounted on each limb.	Semantic Scholar
To evaluate the climbing capabilities of the robot, we use it to perform climbing experiments on a rugged and steep slope.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that the prototype can safely climb over such challenging terrain that is similar to a gravity offload system.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel method to deal with the scale ambiguity in monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) based on control stability.	Semantic Scholar
We analytically show that, first, using unscaled state feedback from monocular SLAM for control can lead to system instability, and, second, there is a unique linear relationship between the absolute scale of the SLAM system and the control gain at which such instability arises.	Semantic Scholar
Using this property, our system estimates the scale by adapting the gain and detecting the self-induced oscillations.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike conventional monocular approaches, no additional metric sensors are used for scale estimation.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the ability of our method to estimate the scale for performing autonomous indoor navigation with a low-cost quadrotor MAV.	Semantic Scholar

This paper mainly deals with the problem of designing delayed state-feedback controller for neural networks with leakage delay.	Semantic Scholar
By constructing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional including double integral terms having two different exponential decay rates and utilizing linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique with the help of slack variables, some sufficient conditions for globally exponential stabilization results are obtained by designing of delayed state-feedback controller.	Semantic Scholar
The novelty of this paper includes: (i) although many papers dealt with dynamics of neural networks with leakage delay, there is little work on design of feedback controller.	Semantic Scholar
Even there is almost no result that deals with the delay-feedback controller for such delay systems, which is the main motivation of this paper; (ii) the derived delay-dependent stability criteria establish the relationship between leakage delay and time delay in the feedback term, which can be easily checked via the MATLAB LMI toolbox; (iii) we consider the general case that the control term is given in the form of Bu, where B is an n×m real matrix.	Semantic Scholar
Such case is more difficult to handle than the special case that B is unit matrix.	Semantic Scholar
It indicates that the controller can be used in all states or in some states by proper selection of the matrix B.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness of the proposed method in this paper is illustrated via numerical examples.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, for the first time, we show how to formulate a structured support vector machine (SSVM) as two layers in a convolutional neural network, where the top layer is a loss augmented inference layer and the bottom layer is the normal convolutional layer.	Semantic Scholar
We show that a deformable part model can be learned with the proposed structured SVM neural network by backpropagating the error of the deformable part model to the convolutional neural network.	Semantic Scholar
The forward propagation calculates the loss augmented inference and the backpropagation calculates the gradient from the loss augmented inference layer to the convolutional layer.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, we obtain a new type of convolutional neural network called an Structured SVM convolutional neural network, which we applied to the human pose estimation problem.	Semantic Scholar
This new neural network can be used as the final layers in deep learning.	Semantic Scholar
Our method jointly learns the structural model parameters and the appearance model parameters.	Semantic Scholar
We implemented our method as a new layer in the existing Caffe library.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a method for designing the gait of a snake robot that moves in a complicated environment.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a method for expressing the target form of a snake robot by connecting curve segments whose curvature and torsion are already known.	Semantic Scholar
Because the characteristics of each combined shape are clear, we can design the target form intuitively and approximate a snake robot configuration to this form with low computational cost.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we propose two novel gaits for the snake robot as a design example of the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
The first gait is aimed at moving over a flange on a pipe, while the other is the crawler gait aimed at moving over rough terrain.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrated the effectiveness of the two gaits on a pipe and rough terrain in experiments.	Semantic Scholar
In the cloud context, users are often called tenants.	Semantic Scholar
A cloud DBMS shared by many tenants is called a multi-tenant DBMS.	Semantic Scholar
The resource consolidation in such a DBMS allows the tenants to only pay for the resources that they consume, while providing the opportunity for the provider to increase its economic gain.	Semantic Scholar
For this, a Service Level Agreement (SLA) is usually established between the provider and a tenant.	Semantic Scholar
However, in the current systems, the SLA is often defined by the provider, while the tenant should agree with it before using the service.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, only the availability objective is described in the SLA, but not the performance objective.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, an SLA negotiation framework is proposed, in which the provider and the tenant define the performance objective together in a fair way.	Semantic Scholar
To demonstrate the feasibility and the advantage of this framework, we evaluate its impact on query optimization.	Semantic Scholar
We formally define the problem by including the cost-efficiency aspect, we design a cost model and study the plan search space for this problem, we revise two search methods to adapt to the new context, and we propose a heuristic to solve the resource contention problem caused by concurrent queries of multiple tenants.	Semantic Scholar
We also conduct a performance evaluation to show that, our optimization approach (i.e., driven by the SLA) can be much more cost-effective than the traditional approach which always minimizes the query completion time.	Semantic Scholar
The coexistence of humans and robots in fenceless robot cells requires robust safety precautions to prevent humans from being injured.	Semantic Scholar
Currently, safety is ensured by limiting the robot velocity, force, and power.	Semantic Scholar
This results in large cycle times and, hence, very inefficient industrial applications, where no amortization of the robotic system can be expected.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, a novel method for improving the robot performance is presented that still complies with the international safety standards for collaborative robots.	Semantic Scholar
The approach of this letter is based on a projection of a human arm motion into the robot's path to estimate a possible collision with the robot.	Semantic Scholar
This idea is addressed in an optimization approach by minimizing the time needed by the robot to reach the goal position under human-in-the-loop constraints.	Semantic Scholar
The segmented path is optimized by solving a nonlinear programming problem, and the effect of crucial parameters is analyzed.	Semantic Scholar
To guarantee a flexible motion of the resulting optimized path, a generalization method using dynamic movement primitives and the compliance of constraints are proposed.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments validate this new method that significantly improves the efficiency of human–robot coexistence.	Semantic Scholar
We consider the problem of repeatable motion planning for redundant robotic systems performing cyclic tasks in the presence of obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
For this open problem, we present a control-based randomized planner, which produces closed collision-free paths in configuration space and guarantees continuous satisfaction of the task constraints.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed algorithm, which relies on bidirectional search and loop closure in the task-constrained configuration space, is shown to be probabilistically complete.	Semantic Scholar
A modified version of the planner is also devised for the case in which configuration-space paths are required to be smooth.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we present planning results in various scenarios involving both free-flying and nonholonomic robots to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
We propose an audio-visual target identification approach for egocentric data with cross-modal model adaptation.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach blindly and iteratively adapts the time-dependent models of each modality to varying target appearance and environmental conditions using the posterior of the other modality.	Semantic Scholar
The adaptation is unsupervised and performed online; thus, models can be improved as new unlabeled data become available.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, accurate models do not deteriorate when a modality is underperforming thanks to an appropriate selection of the parameters in the adaptation.	Semantic Scholar
Importantly, unlike traditional audio-visual integration methods, the proposed approach is also useful for temporal intervals during which only one modality is available or when different modalities are used for different tasks.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate the proposed method in an end-to-end multimodal person identification application with two challenging real-world datasets and show that the proposed approach successfully adapts models in presence of mild mismatch.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that the proposed approach is beneficial to other multimodal score fusion algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
This paper describes a study that explores the force exertion effect on the classification of grasps using a force myography (FMG) technology.	Semantic Scholar
Nine participants were recruited to the study; each performed a set of 16 different grasps from a grasp taxonomy using eight different levels of force, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
Their wrist muscle pressure was recorded using an array of 16 force sensing resistors.	Semantic Scholar
A linear discriminant analysis model was trained by grasps at a single force level using the natural grasping force to classify grasps generated by eight different levels of force.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that the grasping force significantly affects the accuracy of grasp classification such that a grasping force closer to the natural force achieves a higher accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
A still acceptable classification performance can be achieved for approximately half of the natural grasping force.	Semantic Scholar
The findings of this study help the understanding of how force exertion can affect grasp recognition using FMG.	Semantic Scholar
Knowledge gained from this study will provide guidance for the implementation of gesture control interfaces in terms of grasping force variations.	Semantic Scholar
Solar conversion efficiency is one of the most important quality metrics in solar cell production.	Semantic Scholar
During the production process, many operating factors might potentially influence the process conditions, thereby leading to unstable solar conversion efficiency of solar cell products.	Semantic Scholar
However, most solar cell fabrication plants focus more on inspections of the solar conversion efficiency after the growth of semiconductor epitaxy layers and electrodes because of a lack of an efficient strategy for online detection of process condition changes.	Semantic Scholar
This study develops an automatic approach for change condition detection in the multistage solar cell manufacturing process.	Semantic Scholar
By fully analyzing the geometrical features of the multichannel epitaxy data, process condition information can be obtained from temperature and reflectance profiles during the epitaxy layer growth.	Semantic Scholar
A likelihood ratio test is used to address the extracted features for in-advance change detection in solar conversion efficiency at the semiconductor epitaxy layer growth stage, thereby facilitating timely process adjustment and remedies.	Semantic Scholar
A real case from a multistage solar cell manufacturing process is used to validate the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we introduce a novel transformable aerial robot called DRAGON, which is a dual-rotor-embedded multilink robot with the ability of multi-degree-of-freedom (DoF) aerial transformation.	Semantic Scholar
The new aerial robot can control the full pose in $\mathsf {SE}(3)$ regarding the center of gravity (CoG) of multilinks and can render the multi-DoF aerial transformation, which is accomplished by the original two-DoF force vectoring mechanism on each link called the dual-rotor gimbal module.

Semantic Scholar
Due to its immense application potential and enormous technical challenges, IM has been extensively studied in the past decade.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we survey and synthesize a wide spectrum of existing studies on IM from an <italic>algorithmic perspective</italic>, with a special focus on the following key aspects: (1) a review of well-accepted diffusion models that capture the information diffusion process and build the foundation of the IM problem, (2) a fine-grained taxonomy to classify existing IM algorithms based on their design objectives, (3) a rigorous theoretical comparison of existing IM algorithms, and (4) a comprehensive study on the applications of IM techniques in combining with novel context features of social networks such as topic, location, and time.

Based on this analysis, we then outline the key challenges and research directions to expand the boundary of IM research.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a novel and robust Bayesian approach for autonomous active exploration of unknown objects using tactile perception and sensorimotor control.	Semantic Scholar
Despite recent advances in tactile sensing, robust active exploration remains a challenging problem, which is a major hurdle to the practical deployment of tactile sensors in robots.	Semantic Scholar
Our proposed approach is based on a Bayesian perception method that actively controls the sensor with local small repositioning movements to reduce perception uncertainty, followed by explorative movements based on the outcome of each perceptual decision making step.	Semantic Scholar
Two sensorimotor control strategies are proposed for improving the accuracy and speed of the active exploration that weight the evidence from previous exploratory steps through either a weighted prior or weighted posterior.	Semantic Scholar
The methods are validated both off-line and in real-time on a contour following exploratory procedure.	Semantic Scholar
Results clearly demonstrate improvements in both accuracy and exploration time when using the proposed active methods compared to passive perception.	Semantic Scholar
Our work demonstrates that active perception has the potential to enable robots to perform robust autonomous tactile exploration in natural environments.	Semantic Scholar
Robotic instruments based on concentric tube technology are well suited to minimally invasive surgery since they are slender, can navigate inside small cavities, and can reach around sensitive tissues by taking on shapes of varying curvatures.	Semantic Scholar
Elastic instabilities can arise, however, when rotating one precurved tube inside another.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to prior work that considered only tubes of piecewise constant precurvature, we allow precurvature to vary along the tube's arc length.	Semantic Scholar
Stability conditions for a planar tube pair are derived and used to formulate an optimal design problem.	Semantic Scholar
An analytic formulation of the optimal precurvature function is derived, which achieves a desired tip orientation range while maximizing stability and respecting bending strain limits.	Semantic Scholar
This formulation also includes straight transmission segments at the proximal ends of the tubes.	Semantic Scholar
The result, confirmed by both numerical and physical experiment, enables designs with enhanced stability in comparison to designs of constant precurvature.	Semantic Scholar
Detecting humans is a key skill for mobile robots and intelligent vehicles in a large variety of applications.	Semantic Scholar
Although the problem is well studied for certain sensory modalities such as image data, few works exist that address this detection task using two-dimensional (2-D) range data.	Semantic Scholar
However, a widespread sensory setup for many mobile robots in service and domestic applications contains a horizontally mounted 2-D laser scanner.	Semantic Scholar
Detecting people from 2-D range data is challenging due to the speed and dynamics of human leg motion and the high levels of occlusion and self-occlusion particularly in crowds of people.	Semantic Scholar
While previous approaches mostly relied on handcrafted features, we recently developed the deep learning based wheelchair and walker detector distance robust wheelchair/walker (DROW).	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we show the generalization to people, including small modifications that significantly boost DROW's performance.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, by providing a small, fully online temporal window in our network, we further boost our score.	Semantic Scholar
We extend the DROW dataset with person annotations, making this the largest dataset of person annotations in 2-D range data, recorded during several days in a real-world environment with high diversity.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments with three current baseline methods indicate it is a challenging dataset, on which our improved DROW detector beats the current state-of-the-art.	Semantic Scholar
Chromatically perceptive observers are endowed with a sense of similarity between colors.	Semantic Scholar
For example, two shades of green that are only slightly discriminable are perceived as similar, whereas other pairs of colors, for example, blue and yellow, typically elicit markedly different sensations.	Semantic Scholar
The notion of similarity need not be shared by different observers.	Semantic Scholar
Dichromat and trichromat subjects perceive colors differently, and two dichromats (or two trichromats, for that matter) may judge chromatic differences inconsistently.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, there is ample evidence that different animal species sense colors diversely.	Semantic Scholar
To capture the subjective metric of color perception, here we construct a notion of distance in color space based on the physiology of the retina, and is thereby individually tailored for different observers.	Semantic Scholar
By applying the Fisher metric to an analytical model of color representation, we construct a notion of distance that reproduces behavioral experiments of classical discrimination tasks.	Semantic Scholar
We then derive a coordinate transformation that defines a new chromatic space in which the Euclidean distance between any two colors is equal to the perceptual distance, as seen by one individual subject, endowed with an arbitrary number of color-sensitive photoreceptors, each with arbitrary absorption probability curves and appearing in arbitrary proportions.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate manipulation of objects using the dynamics of a rope-like structure attached to a mobile robot as a passive tail.	Semantic Scholar
Three challenges arise in modeling and planning: the physics involved is nontrivial, the tail is underactuated, and motions of the object are nondeterministic.	Semantic Scholar
For such systems, some actions are well characterized by a simplified motion model (e.g., for dragging objects), but we resort to data-driven methods for others (e.g., striking motions).	Semantic Scholar
A sampling-based motion planner, adapted to deal with nondeterministic object motions, is used to optimize motion sequences based on a specified preference over a set of objectives, such as execution time, navigation cost, or collision likelihood.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments show that a robot with a passive tail can manipulate cylindrical objects with (quasi-static) dragging, dynamic striking motions, and combinations thereof.	Semantic Scholar
The method produces solutions that suit diverse preferences effectively, and we analyze the complementary nature of dynamic and quasi-static motions, showing that there exist regimes where transitions between the two are indeed desirable, as reflected in the plans produced.	Semantic Scholar
For a multi-gantry production system, in which several gantries move among the machines and load/unload parts, the assignment of gantries directly impacts the system performance.	Semantic Scholar
Gantry scheduling problem is extremely important, involving when and where the gantries are assigned to the machines.	Semantic Scholar
This letter formulates the gantry scheduling problem as an online task allocation (OTA) problem, and solves for an optimal gantry assignment policy to maximize the system throughput.	Semantic Scholar
The multi-gantry production system is analyzed and important system properties are derived.	Semantic Scholar
The production system performance is evaluated through permanent production loss and opportunity window.	Semantic Scholar
Such knowledge is used to define the key parameters in the OTA problem.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the analysis of the system production performance, the optimization problem is solved and consequently a gantry assignment policy is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
A numerical study is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed policy by comparing with first-come-first-served policy.	Semantic Scholar
This paper considers the delay-dependent stability of memristive complex-valued neural networks (MCVNNs).	Semantic Scholar
A novel linear mapping function is presented to transform the complex-valued system into the real-valued system.	Semantic Scholar
Under such mapping function, both continuous-time and discrete-time MCVNNs are analyzed in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
Firstly, when activation functions are continuous but not Lipschitz continuous, an extended matrix inequality is proved to ensure the stability of continuous-time MCVNNs.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, if activation functions are discontinuous, a discontinuous adaptive controller is designed to acquire its stability by applying Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals.	Semantic Scholar
Secondly, compared with techniques in continuous-time MCVNNs, the Halanay-type inequality and comparison principle are firstly used to exploit the dynamical behaviors of discrete-time MCVNNs.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the effectiveness of theoretical results is illustrated through numerical examples.	Semantic Scholar
Many recent generative models make use of neural networks to transform the probability distribution of a simple low-dimensional noise process into the complex distribution of the data.	Semantic Scholar
This raises the question of whether biological networks operate along similar principles to implement a probabilistic model of the environment through transformations of intrinsic noise processes.	Semantic Scholar
The intrinsic neural and synaptic noise processes in biological networks, however, are quite different from the noise processes used in current abstract generative networks.	Semantic Scholar
This, together with the discrete nature of spikes and local circuit interactions among the neurons, raises several difficulties when using recent generative modeling frameworks to train biologically motivated models.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we show that a biologically motivated model based on multilayer winner-take-all circuits and stochastic synapses admits an approximate analytical description.	Semantic Scholar
This allows us to use the proposed networks in a variational learning setting where stochastic backpropagation is used to optimize a lower bound on the data log likelihood, thereby learning a generative model of the data.	Semantic Scholar
We illustrate the generality of the proposed networks and learning technique by using them in a structured output prediction task and a semisupervised learning task.	Semantic Scholar
Our results extend the domain of application of modern stochastic network architectures to networks where synaptic transmission failure is the principal noise mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
Biological bipeds have long been thought to take advantage of compliance and passive dynamics to walk and run, but realizing robotic locomotion in this fashion has been difficult in practice.	Semantic Scholar
Assume The Robot Is A Sphere (ATRIAS) is a bipedal robot designed to take advantage of the inherent stabilizing effects that emerge as a result of tuned mechanical compliance (Table 1).	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we describe the mechanics of the biped and how our controller exploits the interplay between passive dynamics and actuation to achieve robust locomotion.	Semantic Scholar
We outline our development process for the incremental design and testing of our controllers through rapid iteration.	Semantic Scholar
This study addresses the issue of the adaptive output tracking control for a category of uncertain nonstrict-feedback delayed incommensurate fractional-order systems in the presence of nonaffine structures, unmeasured pseudo-states, unknown control directions, unknown actuator nonlinearities and output constraints.	Semantic Scholar
Firstly, the mean value theorem and the Gaussian error function are introduced to eliminate the difficulties that arise from the nonaffine structures and the unknown actuator nonlinearities, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
Secondly, the immeasurable tracking error variables are suitably estimated by constructing a fractional-order linear observer.	Semantic Scholar
Thirdly, the neural network, the Razumikhin Lemma, the variable separation approach, and the smooth Nussbaum-type function are used to deal with the uncertain nonlinear dynamics, the unknown time-varying delays, the nonstrict feedback and the unknown control directions, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
Fourthly, asymmetric barrier Lyapunov functions are employed to overcome the violation of the output constraints and to tune online the parameters of the adaptive neural controller.	Semantic Scholar
Through rigorous analysis, it is proved that the boundedness of all variables in the closed-loop system and the semi global asymptotic tracking are ensured without transgression of the constraints.	Semantic Scholar
The principal contributions of this study can be summarized as follows: (1) based on Caputo's definitions and new lemmas, methods concerning the controllability, observability and stability analysis of integer-order systems are extended to fractional-order ones, (2) the output tracking objective for a relatively large class of uncertain systems is achieved with a simple controller and less tuning parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, computer-simulation studies from the robotic field are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.	Semantic Scholar
Human guidance in situations where the users cannot rely on their main sensory modalities, such as assistive or search-and-rescue scenarios, is a challenging task.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we address the problem of guiding users along collision-free paths in dynamic environments, assuming that they cannot rely on their main sensory modalities.	Semantic Scholar
In order to safely guide the subjects, we adapt the optimal reciprocal collision avoidance to our specific problem.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed algorithm takes into account the stimuli which can be displayed to the users and the motion uncertainty of the users when reacting to the provided stimuli.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed algorithm was evaluated in three different dynamic scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
A total of 18 blindfolded human subjects were asked to follow haptic cues in order to reach a target area while avoiding real static obstacles and moving users.	Semantic Scholar
Three metrics such as time to reach the goal, length of the trajectories, and minimal distance from the obstacles are considered to compare results obtained using this approach and experiments performed without visual impairments.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results reveal that blindfolded subjects are successfully able to avoid collisions and safely reach the targets in all the performed trials.	Semantic Scholar
Although in this letter we display directional cues via haptic stimuli, we believe that the proposed approach can be general and tuned to work with different haptic interfaces and/or feedback modalities.	Semantic Scholar
Drift and scale ambiguity are two main issues which reduce localization accuracy in monocular visual odometry (MVO).	Semantic Scholar
It is necessary to propose a unified model to represent these measurement uncertainties.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a geometric map-assisted localization approach for mobile robots equipped with MVO.	Semantic Scholar
We model the measurement of MVO as a group of particles, which obey uniform-Gaussian distribution and cover measurement uncertainties including scale ambiguity and measurement randomness.	Semantic Scholar
The saliency of each particle can be obtained from the distribution to indicate raw measurement certainty of MVO.	Semantic Scholar
Geometric map-assisted shape matching is implemented as the measurement model to assign consistency to the particles generated from the distribution.	Semantic Scholar
Both saliency and consistency are considered in particle weights determination.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, based on the statistical properties of the probability distribution, a parameter estimation scheme is proposed to narrow down the scale ambiguity of MVO while resampling particles.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments with KITTI dataset have demonstrated that the proposed approach greatly enhances positioning accuracy, with average localization error of 6.54 m in over 15.89 km run.	Semantic Scholar
To address the challenges with real-time accurate modeling of multisegment continuum manipulators in the presence of significant external and body loads, we introduce a novel series solution for variable-curvature Cosserat rod static and Lagrangian dynamic methods.	Semantic Scholar
By combining a modified Lagrange polynomial series solution, based on experimental observations, with Ritz and Ritz–Galerkin methods, the infinite modeling state space of a continuum manipulator is minimized to geometrical position of a handful of physical points (in our case two).	Semantic Scholar
As a result, a unified easy to implement vector formalism is proposed for the nonlinear impedance and configuration control.	Semantic Scholar
We showed that by considering the mechanical effects of highly elastic axial deformation, the model accuracy is increased up to 6%.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed model predicts experimental results with 6%–8% (4–6 mm) mean error for the Ritz–Galerkin method in static cases and 16%–20% (12–14 mm) mean error for the Ritz method in dynamic cases, in planar and general three-dimensional motions.	Semantic Scholar
Comparing to five different models in the literature, our approximate solution is shown to be more accurate with the smallest possible number of modeling states and suitable for real-time modeling, observation, and control applications.	Semantic Scholar
There has been an increasing interest in cable-driven robotic rehabilitation systems with adjustable stiffness to provide safe and natural interactions for physical therapy.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of various stiffness modulation schema and alternate attachment configurations within a scaled planar elastic articulated-cable leg-orthosis emulator for gait training.	Semantic Scholar
Elasticity, incorporated by series-elastic springs or adjustable stiffness modules connected to nonflexible cables, can add substantial robustness during forceful interactions with uncertain environments.	Semantic Scholar
Other benefits include force-sensor-free tension control, i.e., without using force sensors connected to cables and better overall tension distribution.	Semantic Scholar
However, elasticity also degrades the accuracy of positioning and makes the system more disposed to external disturbances.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, we examine the performance of actively modulating the effective stiffness to smooth out any perturbations to the scaled normative rehabilitative motion patterns and achieve natural gaits (by simulation and experiment).	Semantic Scholar
Stiffness modulation can now be achieved by varying system configuration, antagonistic cable tension, or joint stiffness, and we examine the benefits of each.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we also comparatively evaluate the functional performance of alternate attachment configurations ankle–cable configuration, articulated-cable configuration by way of simulation and experiments.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we focus on the formalization of the proofs of equivalence between different versions of Euclid’s 5th postulate.	Semantic Scholar
Our study is performed in the context of Tarski’s neutral geometry, or equivalently in Hilbert’s geometry defined by the first three groups of axioms, and uses an intuitionistic logic, assuming excluded-middle only for point equality.	Semantic Scholar
Our formalization provides a clarification of the conditions under which different versions of the postulates are equivalent.	Semantic Scholar
Following Beeson, we study which versions of the postulate are equivalent, constructively or not.	Semantic Scholar
We distinguish four groups of parallel postulates.	Semantic Scholar
In each group, the proof of their equivalence is mechanized using intuitionistic logic without continuity assumptions.	Semantic Scholar
For the equivalence between the groups additional assumptions are required.	Semantic Scholar
The equivalence between the 34 postulates is formalized in Archimedean planar neutral geometry.	Semantic Scholar
We also formalize a variant of a theorem due to Szmielew.	Semantic Scholar
This variant states that, assuming Aristotle’s axiom, any statement which hold in the Euclidean plane and does not hold in the Hyperbolic plane is equivalent to Euclid’s 5th postulate.	Semantic Scholar
To obtain all these results, we have developed a large library in planar neutral geometry, including the formalization of the concept of sum of angles and the proof of the Saccheri–Legendre theorem, which states that assuming Archimedes’ axiom, the sum of the angles in a triangle is at most two right angles.	Semantic Scholar
Natural language provides a convenient means of communicating information, and as such, is an ideal medium for enabling nonexpert users to teach robots novel tasks.	Semantic Scholar
However, in order to take advantage of natural language, a series of challenges must first be overcome.	Semantic Scholar
These challenges include the need to a) generalize learnt tasks to novel scenarios without retraining, b) resolve problems encountered during task execution, and c) derive implicit information from knowledge about the domain.	Semantic Scholar
To solve these challenges, this paper presents a novel approach to learning complex hierarchical tasks through natural language instruction, which not only allows learnt tasks to be generalized to novel situations without the need for retraining, but also enables an agent to derive implicit information from domain knowledge.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, the approach presented in this paper enables the agent to infer task properties, such as preconditions and effects, directly from the explanation of the task flow.	Semantic Scholar
The authors validate the approach by demonstrating an implementation of the algorithms both on a simulated agent, as well as a Baxter robot.	Semantic Scholar
In each case, the agent is provided with a small set of primitive tasks for manipulating its workspace.	Semantic Scholar
From these primitives, the authors demonstrate the ability to teach the agent increasing complex tasks, including tasks of table cleaning, solely through natural language instructions.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a method for efficiently testing the stability of an object under contact that accommodates empirical models of admissible forces at individual contact points.	Semantic Scholar
It handles a diverse range of possible geometries of the admissible force volume, including anisotropy, adhesion, and even nonconvexity.	Semantic Scholar
The method discretizes the contact region into patches, performs a convex decomposition of a polyhedral approximation to each admissible force volume, and then formulates the problem as a mixed integer linear program.	Semantic Scholar
The model can also accommodate articulated robot hands with torque limits and joint frictions.	Semantic Scholar
Predictions of our method are evaluated experimentally in object lifting tasks using a gripper that exploits microspines to exert strongly anisotropic forces.	Semantic Scholar
The method is applied to calculate gripper loading capabilities and equilibrium predictions for a quadruped climbing robot on steep and overhanging terrain.	Semantic Scholar
Good test data is crucial for driving new developments in computer vision (CV), but two questions remain unanswered: which situations should be covered by the test data, and how much testing is enough to reach a conclusion?	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we propose a new answer to these questions using a standard procedure devised by the safety community to validate complex systems: the hazard and operability analysis (HAZOP).	Semantic Scholar
It is designed to systematically identify possible causes of system failure or performance loss.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce a generic CV model that creates the basis for the hazard analysis and—for the first time—apply an extensive HAZOP to the CV domain.	Semantic Scholar
The result is a publicly available checklist with more than 900 identified individual hazards.	Semantic Scholar
This checklist can be utilized to evaluate existing test datasets by quantifying the covered hazards.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our approach by first analyzing and annotating the popular stereo vision test datasets Middlebury and KITTI.	Semantic Scholar
Second, we demonstrate a clearly negative influence of the hazards in the checklist on the performance of six popular stereo matching algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
The presented approach is a useful tool to evaluate and improve test datasets and creates a common basis for future dataset designs.	Semantic Scholar

In this article, we present a decentralized convention formation framework for creating social conventions within large multiagent convention spaces.	Semantic Scholar
We study the role of the topological characteristics of the network in forming conventions with an emphasis on scale-free topologies.	Semantic Scholar
We hypothesize that contextual knowledge encapsulated in the topology can help improve both the quality of the emergent convention and the speed of forming such a convention.	Semantic Scholar
We also investigate the influence of network diversity.	Semantic Scholar
While recent research on diversity indicates that it improves organizational productivity, we observe that not all diversity is equally useful and identify the necessary conditions to maximize the benefit of diversity.	Semantic Scholar
We validate our convention formation framework using a language coordination problem in which agents in a multiagent system construct a common lexicon in a decentralized fashion.	Semantic Scholar
Agent interactions are modeled using a language game where every agent repeatedly plays with its neighbors.	Semantic Scholar
Each agent stochastically updates its lexicon based on the utility values of the lexicons received from its immediate neighbors.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce a novel context-aware utility computation mechanism and equip the agents with the ability to reorganize their neighborhood based on this utility estimate to expedite the convention formation process.	Semantic Scholar
A key idea behind our approach is the ability of socially influential high-utility-lexicon agents to bias their neighbors towards accepting their lexicons.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experimentation results indicate that our proposed solution is both effective (able to converge into a large majority convention state with more than 90% agents sharing a high-quality lexicon) and efficient (faster) as compared to state-of-the-art approaches for social conventions in large convention spaces.	Semantic Scholar
We consider an optimal stopping formulation of the mission monitoring problem, in which a monitor vehicle must remain in close proximity to an autonomous robot that stochastically follows a predicted trajectory.	Semantic Scholar
This problem arises in a diverse range of scenarios, such as autonomous underwater vehicles supervised by surface vessels, pedestrians monitored by aerial vehicles, and animals monitored by agricultural robots.	Semantic Scholar
The key problem characteristics we consider are that the monitor must remain stationary while observing the robot, robot motion is modeled in general as a stochastic process, and observations are modeled as a spatial probability distribution.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a resolution-complete algorithm that runs in a polynomial time.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm is based on a sweep-plane approach and generates a motion plan that maximizes the expected observation time and value.	Semantic Scholar
A variety of stochastic models may be used to represent the robot trajectory.	Semantic Scholar

The improved reciprocally convex combination (RCC) and weighted integral inequality (WII) techniques are utilized to obtain new sufficient conditions to ascertain the exponential stability result of such delayed GNNs.	Semantic Scholar
The superiority of the obtained results is clearly demonstrated by numerical examples.	Semantic Scholar

The interpolation, prediction, and feature analysis of fine-gained air quality are three important topics in the area of urban air computing.	Semantic Scholar
The solutions to these topics can provide extremely useful information to support air pollution control, and consequently generate great societal and technical impacts.	Semantic Scholar
Most of the existing work solves the three problems separately by different models.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a general and effective approach to solve the three problems in one model called the Deep Air Learning (DAL).	Semantic Scholar
The main idea of DAL lies in embedding feature selection and semi-supervised learning in different layers of the deep learning network.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach utilizes the information pertaining to the unlabeled spatio-temporal data to improve the performance of the interpolation and the prediction, and performs feature selection and association analysis to reveal the main relevant features to the variation of the air quality.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our approach with extensive experiments based on real data sources obtained in Beijing, China.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments show that DAL is superior to the peer models from the recent literature when solving the topics of interpolation, prediction, and feature analysis of fine-gained air quality.	Semantic Scholar

In this paper, a new method for generating object and action proposals in images and videos is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
It builds on activations of different convolutional layers of a pretrained CNN, combining the localization accuracy of the early layers with the high informativeness (and hence recall) of the later layers.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we build an inverse cascade that, going backward from the later to the earlier convolutional layers of the CNN, selects the most promising locations and refines them in a coarse-to-fine manner.	Semantic Scholar
The method is efficient, because (i) it re-uses the same features extracted for detection, (ii) it aggregates features using integral images, and (iii) it avoids a dense evaluation of the proposals thanks to the use of the inverse coarse-to-fine cascade.	Semantic Scholar
The method is also accurate.	Semantic Scholar
We show that DeepProposals outperform most of the previous object proposal and action proposal approaches and, when plugged into a CNN-based object detector, produce state-of-the-art detection performance.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, the impedance control for smoothly receiving the impact of an incoming object is designed and realized.	Semantic Scholar
The control strategy is based on the idea that the back drive motion of an end effector attributable to the collision impact is regarded as plastic deformation of the robot.	Semantic Scholar
The impedance dynamics are constructed from the Maxwell model, which describes plastic deformation.	Semantic Scholar
Next, two types of control methods are proposed in terms of the connection configuration of the spring and damper.	Semantic Scholar
Physical simulations of the impact absorption with a robotic arm are executed to validate and analyze the proposed control laws.	Semantic Scholar

Thus the approach treats the deformable part model as an instance of structured SVM learning, and is able to jointly learn both structural and appearance model parameters.	Semantic Scholar
By using a neural network’s innate ability to back-propagate errors to lower layers, the structured SVM model exactly calculates the structured SVM loss.	Semantic Scholar

Concentric tube robots experience elastic instability when the potential energy stored in torsional twisting of the tubes is suddenly released.	Semantic Scholar
To date, ensuring stability for all possible rotational configurations has involved constraining the precurvatures and / or precurved lengths of the tubes comprising the robot, which results in limitations on robot curvature and workspace.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a design approach that eliminates the constraints on tube precurvature and length for stable rotation.	Semantic Scholar
The idea is to compose designs in which, at every point along the length of a robot, a single tube is precurved and the others are straight.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting designs do not experience any precurvature-induced torsional tube twisting and so are stable regardless of precurvature and length.	Semantic Scholar
This design concept can be usefully employed at the tip of a robot to provide a large stable range of tip orientation angles.	Semantic Scholar
A stability analysis is provided for designs composed of an arbitrary number of tubes and design rules are provided for tube pairs that can produce tip angles varying from zero to a desired maximum value.	Semantic Scholar
The method is validated experimentally for a tube pair comprised of three sections.	Semantic Scholar
Data visualization is a common and effective technique for data exploration.	Semantic Scholar
However, for complex data, it is infeasible for an analyst to manually generate and browse all possible visualizations for insights.	Semantic Scholar
This observation motivated the need for automated solutions that can effectively recommend such visualizations.	Semantic Scholar
The main idea underlying those solutions is to evaluate the utility of all possible visualizations and then recommend the top-k visualizations.	Semantic Scholar
This process incurs high data processing cost, that is further aggravated by the presence of numerical dimensional attributes.	Semantic Scholar
To address that challenge, we propose novel view recommendation schemes, which incorporate a hybrid multi-objective utility function that captures the impact of numerical dimension attributes.	Semantic Scholar
Our first scheme, Multi-Objective View Recommendation for Data Exploration (MuVE), adopts an incremental evaluation of our multi-objective utility function, which allows pruning of a large number of low-utility views and avoids unnecessary objective evaluations.	Semantic Scholar
Our second scheme, upper MuVE (uMuVE), further improves the pruning power by setting the upper bounds on the utility of views and allowing interleaved processing of views, at the expense of increased memory usage.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, our third scheme, Memory-aware uMuVE (MuMuVE), provides pruning power close to that of uMuVE, while keeping memory usage within a pre-specified limit.	Semantic Scholar
Temporal information has been widely used to promote the information retrieval (IR) performance, especially for microblog search which usually prefers the latest news and events.	Semantic Scholar
Previous studies mainly focused on incorporating the document-level temporal information into retrieval, while the temporal relevance of each query word was not well investigated.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a word temporal predictor to characterize the word-level temporal relevance by fine-grained time-aware kernel density estimation over the feedback documents.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we present a fine-grained time-aware framework to integrate the proposed word temporal predictor with the traditional document temporal predictor for retrieval.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we incorporate the framework into two state-of-the-art retrieval models, namely language model (LM) and BM25.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results on the TREC 2011-2014 Microblog collections, show that our proposed word temporal predictor is effective to boost the retrieval performance within both LM and BM25 frameworks.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we achieve significant improvements over the strong baselines with optimized settings in most cases.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, our fine-grained time-aware models with word temporal predictor are comparable to if not better than the state-of-the-art temporal retrieval models.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we report on the development of the clock-torqued rolling spring loaded inverted pendulum (CTR-SLIP) model.	Semantic Scholar
The new model, which adds clock-based torque control on the leg orientation of the previously developed R-SLIP model, has two advantages: first, regulating the model to follow its passive dynamic running (i.e., at a fixed point) significantly increases the model's basin of attraction; and second, formulating the model closer to the empirical robot enables the model to serve as the transient and steady-state running template of the robot as the anchor.	Semantic Scholar
These features enable the model/robot to perform speed transition from one fixed point profile to another, and the experimental validation confirms that the robot can successfully transition between two running speeds bidirectionally.	Semantic Scholar
The achievement of variable-speed running by the proposed method has a unique merit—it is purely model-based, and there is no need for further tuning, optimization, or learning processes.	Semantic Scholar
Regarding the robot, the proposed strategy only requires it to have simple position control to regulate its leg orientations, and there is no need for other sensory modules to provide information for feedback.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a new formulation for learning the dynamics of legged robots performing locomotion tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Using sensor data we learn error terms at the level of rigid body dynamics and actuation dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
The learning framework deals with the hybrid nature of legged systems given by different contact configurations: We use the projection of the rigid body dynamics into a subspace consistent with the contact constraints.	Semantic Scholar
The equations of motion in such subspace do not depend on the contact forces, allowing to formulate a learning problem where force sensor data are not required.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, we propose to use the columns of end-effector Jacobians as basis vectors, obtaining a model that generalizes across contact configurations.	Semantic Scholar
Both locally weighted projection regression and sparse Gaussian process regression are used as supervised learning techniques.	Semantic Scholar
As application of the learned model, an inverse dynamics control method is extended.	Semantic Scholar
Hardware experiments with a quadruped robot show reduced RMS tracking error and a significant reduction in RMS feedback effort during base-only, walking, and trotting motions.	Semantic Scholar
Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a useful tool in detecting the latent relationship between two sets of multivariate variables.	Semantic Scholar
In theoretical analysis of CCA, a regularization technique is utilized to investigate the consistency of its analysis.	Semantic Scholar
This letter addresses the consistency property of CCA from a least squares view.	Semantic Scholar
We construct a constrained empirical risk minimization framework of CCA and apply a two-stage randomized Kaczmarz method to solve it.	Semantic Scholar
In the first stage, we remove the noise, and in the second stage, we compute the canonical weight vectors.	Semantic Scholar
Rigorous theoretical consistency is addressed.	Semantic Scholar
The statistical consistency of this novel scenario is extended to the kernel version of it.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.	Semantic Scholar

Many existing approaches for image-to-geometry registration assume that either a textured 3D model or a good initial guess of the 3D pose is available to bootstrap the registration process.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we consider the registration of photographs to 3D models even when no texture information is available.	Semantic Scholar
This is very challenging as we cannot rely on texture gradients, and even shading gradients are hard to estimate since the lighting conditions are unknown.	Semantic Scholar
To that end, we propose average shading gradients, a rendering technique that estimates the average gradient magnitude over all lighting directions under Lambertian shading.	Semantic Scholar
We use this gradient representation as the building block of a registration pipeline based on matching sparse features.	Semantic Scholar
To cope with inevitable false matches due to the missing texture information and to increase robustness, the pose of the 3D model is estimated in two stages.	Semantic Scholar
Coarse pose hypotheses are first obtained from a single correct match each, subsequently refined using SIFT flow, and finally verified.	Semantic Scholar
We apply our algorithm to registering images of real-world objects to untextured 3D meshes of limited accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we show that registration can be performed even for paintings despite lacking photo-realism.	Semantic Scholar
Edges are key components of any visual scene to the extent that we can recognise objects merely by their silhouettes.	Semantic Scholar
The human visual system captures edge information through neurons in the visual cortex that are sensitive to both intensity discontinuities and particular orientations.	Semantic Scholar
The “classical approach” assumes that these cells are only responsive to the stimulus present within their receptive fields, however, recent studies demonstrate that surrounding regions and inter-areal feedback connections influence their responses significantly.	Semantic Scholar
In this work we propose a biologically-inspired edge detection model in which orientation selective neurons are represented through the first derivative of a Gaussian function resembling double-opponent cells in the primary visual cortex (V1).	Semantic Scholar
In our model we account for four kinds of receptive field surround, i.e.	Semantic Scholar
full, far, iso- and orthogonal-orientation, whose contributions are contrast-dependant.	Semantic Scholar
The output signal from V1 is pooled in its perpendicular direction by larger V2 neurons employing a contrast-variant centre-surround kernel.	Semantic Scholar
We further introduce a feedback connection from higher-level visual areas to the lower ones.	Semantic Scholar
The results of our model on three benchmark datasets show a big improvement compared to the current non-learning and biologically-inspired state-of-the-art algorithms while being competitive to the learning-based methods.	Semantic Scholar
Grid cells of the rodent entorhinal cortex are essential for spatial navigation.	Semantic Scholar
Although their function is commonly believed to be either path integration or localization, the origin or purpose of their hexagonal firing fields remains disputed.	Semantic Scholar
Here they are proposed to arise as an optimal encoding of transitions in sequences.	Semantic Scholar
First, storage requirements for transitions in general episodic sequences are examined using propositional logic and graph theory.	Semantic Scholar
Subsequently, transitions in complete metric spaces are considered under the assumption of an ideal sampling of an input space.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown that memory capacity of neurons that have to encode multiple feasible spatial transitions is maximized by a hexagonal pattern.	Semantic Scholar
Grid cells are proposed to encode spatial transitions in spatiotemporal sequences, with the entorhinal-hippocampal loop forming a multitransition system.	Semantic Scholar

This letter considers the cooperative manipulation of a cable-suspended load with two generic aerial robots without the need of explicit communication.	Semantic Scholar
The role of the internal force for the asymptotic stability of the beam position-and-attitude equilibria is analyzed in depth.	Semantic Scholar
Using a nonlinear Lyapunov-based approach, we prove that if a nonzero internal force is chosen, then the asymptotic stabilization of any desired beam attitude can be achieved with a decentralized and communicationless master–slave admittance controller.	Semantic Scholar
If, conversely, a zero internal force is chosen, as done in the majority of the state-of-the-art algorithms, the attitude of the beam is not controllable without communication.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we formally proof the output-strictly passivity of the system with respect to an energy-like storage function and a certain input–output pair.	Semantic Scholar
This proves the stability and the robustness of the method during motion and in nonideal.	Semantic Scholar
The theoretical findings are validated through extensive simulations.	Semantic Scholar
Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search has achieved great success in many tasks.	Semantic Scholar
However, existing popular methods for ANN search, such as hashing and quantization methods, are designed for static databases only.	Semantic Scholar
They cannot handle well the database with data distribution evolving dynamically, due to the high computational effort for retraining the model based on the new database.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we address the problem by developing an online product quantization (online PQ) model and incrementally updating the quantization codebook that accommodates to the incoming streaming data.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, to further alleviate the issue of large scale computation for the online PQ update, we design two budget constraints for the model to update partial PQ codebook instead of all.	Semantic Scholar
We derive a loss bound which guarantees the performance of our online PQ model.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we develop an online PQ model over a sliding window with both data insertion and deletion supported, to reflect the real-time behavior of the data.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments demonstrate that our online PQ model is both time-efficient and effective for ANN search in dynamic large scale databases compared with baseline methods and the idea of partial PQ codebook update further reduces the update cost.	Semantic Scholar
Continuum manipulators are particularly suitable for performing tasks in cluttered environments with limited space for maneuvering.	Semantic Scholar
While there is progress on continuum grasping of an object in a cluttered space, if the environment is unknown where the target object is occluded and only partially visible, such as in a search and rescue scenario, an open problem is how to determine if it is possible to fetch the object.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we address this problem of online determining whether a partially occluded object nested in an unknown cluttered space can be fetched by a continuum manipulator based on sensing the surrounding obstacles progressively with a distance sensor attached to its tip, and if so, how to fetch the object autonomously.	Semantic Scholar
Our method formulates constraints that can be quickly checked from sensed information to decide if a solution exists for a multisection spatial continuum manipulator to access and grasp an object in a cluttered space.	Semantic Scholar
Examples using point clouds of unknown obstacles from RGB-D sensing illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.	Semantic Scholar
Computation is classically studied in terms of automata, formal languages and algorithms; yet, the relation between neural dynamics and symbolic representations and operations is still unclear in traditional eliminative connectionism.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we suggest a unique perspective on this central issue, to which we would like to refer as transparent connectionism, by proposing accounts of how symbolic computation can be implemented in neural substrates.	Semantic Scholar
In this study we first introduce a new model of dynamics on a symbolic space, the versatile shift, showing that it supports the real-time simulation of a range of automata.	Semantic Scholar
We then show that the Gödelization of versatile shifts defines nonlinear dynamical automata, dynamical systems evolving on a vectorial space.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we present a mapping between nonlinear dynamical automata and recurrent artificial neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
The mapping defines an architecture characterized by its granular modularity, where data, symbolic operations and their control are not only distinguishable in activation space, but also spatially localizable in the network itself, while maintaining a distributed encoding of symbolic representations.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting networks simulate automata in real-time and are programmed directly, in the absence of network training.	Semantic Scholar
To discuss the unique characteristics of the architecture and their consequences, we present two examples: (i) the design of a Central Pattern Generator from a finite-state locomotive controller, and (ii) the creation of a network simulating a system of interactive automata that supports the parsing of garden-path sentences as investigated in psycholinguistics experiments.	Semantic Scholar
Objects within a category are often similar in their shape and usage.	Semantic Scholar
When we—as humans—want to grasp something, we transfer our knowledge from past experiences and adapt it to novel objects.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a new approach for transferring grasping skills that accumulates grasping knowledge into a category-level canonical model.	Semantic Scholar
Grasping motions for novel instances of the category are inferred from geometric deformations between the observed instance and the canonical shape.	Semantic Scholar
Correspondences between the shapes are established by means of a non-rigid registration method that combines the coherent point drift approach with subspace methods.	Semantic Scholar
By incorporating category-level information into the registration, we avoid unlikely shapes and focus on deformations actually observed within the category.	Semantic Scholar
Control poses for generating grasping motions are accumulated in the canonical model from grasping definitions of known objects.	Semantic Scholar
According to the estimated shape parameters of a novel instance, the control poses are transformed toward it.	Semantic Scholar
The category-level model makes our method particularly relevant for online grasping, where fully observed objects are not easily available.	Semantic Scholar
This is demonstrated through experiments in which objects with occluded handles are successfully grasped.	Semantic Scholar
Community discovery plays an essential role in the analysis of the structural features of complex networks.	Semantic Scholar
Since online networks grow increasingly large and complex over time, the methods traditionally used for community discovery cannot efficiently handle large-scale network data.	Semantic Scholar
This introduces the important problem of how to effectively and efficiently discover large communities from complex networks.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we propose a fast parallel community discovery model called picaso (a parallel community discovery a lgorithm based on approximate optimization), which integrates two new techniques: (1) Mountain model, which works by utilizing graph theory to approximate the selection of nodes needed for merging, and (2) Landslide algorithm, which is used to update the modularity increment based on the approximated optimization.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the GraphX distribution computing framework is employed in order to achieve parallel community detection over complex networks.	Semantic Scholar
In the proposed model, clustering on modularity is used to initialize the Mountain model as well as to compute the weight of each edge in the networks.	Semantic Scholar
The relationships among the communities are then simplified by applying the Landslide algorithm, which allows us to obtain the community structures of the complex networks.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments were conducted on real and synthetic complex network datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can outperform the state of the art methods, in effectiveness and efficiency, when working to solve the problem of community detection.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we demonstratively prove that overall time performance approximates to four times faster than similar approaches.	Semantic Scholar
Effectively our results suggest a new paradigm for large-scale community discovery of complex networks.	Semantic Scholar
A novel, unsupervised nonparametric model of multivariate probability density functions (pdf) is introduced, namely the Parzen neural network (PNN).	Semantic Scholar
The PNN is intended to overcome the major limitations of traditional (either statistical or neural) pdf estimation techniques.	Semantic Scholar
Besides being profitably simple, the PNN turns out to have nice properties in terms of unbiased modeling capability, asymptotic convergence, and efficiency at test time.	Semantic Scholar
Several matters pertaining the practical application of the PNN are faced in the paper, too.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments are reported, involving (i) synthetic datasets, and (ii) a challenging sex determination task from 1400 scout-view CT-scan images of human crania.	Semantic Scholar
Incidentally, the empirical evidence entails also some conclusions of high anthropological relevance.	Semantic Scholar
Recent studies have explored humanoid robots in contact with the environment in various ways.	Semantic Scholar
However, many of them assumed static rather than sliding contacts.	Semantic Scholar
Studies on humanoid shuffle motion planning have realized sliding motions, such as turning, but relied on quasi-static balance control.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a dynamic balance control method for sliding contact motions.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method consists of the distributed force contact constraint (D.F.C.C.	Semantic Scholar
), which describes rotational sliding contact constraints, and the slide friction control (S.F.C.	Semantic Scholar
), which controls humanoid dynamic balance based on the model predictive control by using the D.F.C.C.	Semantic Scholar
The D.F.C.C.	Semantic Scholar
segments a contact face into a grid of contact points and optimize the vertical component of the contact forces.	Semantic Scholar
This enables us to calculate the sliding friction forces at each contact point.	Semantic Scholar
The S.F.C.	Semantic Scholar
is the model predictive control for distributing contact forces to each contact face considering sliding frictional dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
The D.F.C.C.	Semantic Scholar
is simple and easy to apply to the S.F.C.	Semantic Scholar
In our online stabilizer, we control not only a ZMP, but also contact forces for realizing the contact force distributions planned in the S.F.C.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we show our method's validity through the experiment using life-sized humanoid robot JAXON.	Semantic Scholar
Time-optimal path parameterization (TOPP) is a well-studied problem in robotics and has a wide range of applications.	Semantic Scholar
There are two main families of methods to address TOPP: numerical integration (NI) and convex optimization (CO).	Semantic Scholar
The NI-based methods are fast but difficult to implement and suffer from robustness issues, while CO-based approaches are more robust but, at the same time, significantly slower.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we propose a new approach to TOPP based on reachability analysis.	Semantic Scholar
The key insight is to recursively compute reachable and controllable sets at discretized positions on the path by solving small linear programs.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting algorithm is faster than NI-based methods and as robust as CO-based ones (100% success rate), as confirmed by extensive numerical evaluations.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the proposed approach offers unique additional benefits: admissible velocity propagation and robustness to parametric uncertainty can be derived from it in a simple and natural way.	Semantic Scholar
Two of the fundamental tasks in image understanding using text are caption generation and visual question answering [1, 2].	Semantic Scholar
This work presents an intermediate knowledge structure that can be used for both tasks to obtain increased interpretability.	Semantic Scholar
We call this knowledge structure Scene Description Graph (SDG), as it is a directed labeled graph, representing objects, actions, regions, as well as their attributes, along with inferred concepts and semantic (from KM-Ontology [3]), ontological (i.e.	Semantic Scholar
superclass, hasProperty), and spatial relations.	Semantic Scholar
Thereby a general architecture is proposed in which a system can represent both the content and underlying concepts of an image using an SDG.	Semantic Scholar
The architecture is implemented using generic visual recognition techniques and commonsense reasoning to extract graphs from images.	Semantic Scholar
The utility of the generated SDGs is demonstrated in the applications of image captioning, image retrieval, and through examples in visual question answering.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments in this work show that the extracted graphs capture syntactic and semantic content of images with reasonable accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
One of the major open challenges in self-driving cars is the ability to detect cars and pedestrians to safely navigate in the world.	Semantic Scholar
Deep learning-based object detector approaches have enabled great advances in using camera imagery to detect and classify objects.	Semantic Scholar
But for a safety critical application, such as autonomous driving, the error rates of the current state of the art are still too high to enable safe operation.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the characterization of object detector performance is primarily limited to testing on prerecorded datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Errors that occur on novel data go undetected without additional human labels.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose an automated method to identify mistakes made by object detectors without ground truth labels.	Semantic Scholar
We show that inconsistencies in the object detector output between a pair of similar images can be used as hypotheses for false negatives (e.g., missed detections) and using a novel set of features for each hypothesis, an off-the-shelf binary classifier can be used to find valid errors.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we study two distinct cues–temporal and stereo  inconsistencies—using data that are readily available on most autonomous vehicles.	Semantic Scholar
Our method can be used with any camera-based object detector and we illustrate the technique on several sets of real world data.	Semantic Scholar
We show that a state-of-the-art detector, tracker, and our classifier trained only on synthetic data can identify valid errors on KITTI tracking dataset with an average precision of 0.94.	Semantic Scholar
We also release a new tracking dataset with 104 sequences totaling 80,655 labeled pairs of stereo images along with ground truth disparity from a game engine to facilitate further research.	Semantic Scholar
Antennas are essential in wireless communications and powering systems.	Semantic Scholar
Applications, such as search and rescue and space exploration would greatly benefit from antenna reconfigurability, as well as antenna deployment from a compact and easy-to-transport form.	Semantic Scholar
We present the design and analysis of a reconfigurable and deployable antenna that uses a growing soft robot to form the three-dimensional antenna structure.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach is based on a pneumatic tip-extending robot instrumented with a conducting element.	Semantic Scholar
The robot increases its length to enable antenna deployment and changes shape to enable antenna reconfiguration.	Semantic Scholar
As a model system, we demonstrate a monopole antenna design that uses conducting elements formed from a copper strip that is mechanically disconnected at the leading edge of growth to change the length of the antenna and, as a result, change the resonant frequency.	Semantic Scholar
To achieve desired operating frequencies, return loss data from the antenna was used as feedback in a closed-loop system to control the antenna configuration.	Semantic Scholar
Our monopole supports a frequency tuning range that spans from 0.4 to 2 GHz and can tune between two target frequencies in approximately one second.	Semantic Scholar
We also show that the addition of branching and integrated actuators can be used to generate more complex and diverse antenna shapes.	Semantic Scholar
Branching is implemented in a model Yagi-Uda antenna and we explore the integration of pull cable actuators and pneumatic actuators with a model helical antenna.	Semantic Scholar
Due to its simplicity, efficiency, and efficacy, naive Bayes (NB) has continued to be one of the top 10 algorithms in the data mining and machine learning community.	Semantic Scholar
Of numerous approaches to alleviating its conditional independence assumption, feature weighting has placed more emphasis on highly predictive features than those that are less predictive.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we argue that for NB highly predictive features should be highly correlated with the class (maximum mutual relevance), yet uncorrelated with other features (minimum mutual redundancy).	Semantic Scholar
Based on this premise, we propose a correlation-based feature weighting (CFW) filter for NB.	Semantic Scholar
In CFW, the weight for a feature is a sigmoid transformation of the difference between the feature-class correlation (mutual relevance) and the average feature-feature intercorrelation (average mutual redundancy).	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that NB with CFW significantly outperforms NB and all the other existing state-of-the-art feature weighting filters used to compare.	Semantic Scholar
Compared to feature weighting wrappers for improving NB, the main advantages of CFW are its low computational complexity (no search involved) and the fact that it maintains the simplicity of the final model.	Semantic Scholar
Besides, we apply CFW to text classification and have achieved remarkable improvements.	Semantic Scholar

In this paper, we research the community deception problem.	Semantic Scholar
"Tackling this problem consists in developing techniques to hide a target community (<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mathcal{C}$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""pirro-ieq1-2776133.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula>) from community detection algorithms."

This need emerges whenever a group (e.g., activists, police enforcements, or network participants in general) want to observe and cooperate in a social network while avoiding to be detected.	Semantic Scholar
"We introduce and formalize the community deception problem and devise an efficient algorithm that allows to achieve deception by identifying a certain number (<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\beta$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""pirro-ieq2-2776133.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula>) of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mathcal{C}$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""pirro-ieq3-2776133.gif""/> </alternatives></inline-formula>’s members connections to be rewired."	Semantic Scholar
Deception can be practically achieved in social networks like Facebook by friending or unfriending network members as indicated by our algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
We compare our approach with another technique based on modularity.	Semantic Scholar
By considering a variety of (large) real networks, we provide a systematic evaluation of the robustness of community detection algorithms to deception techniques.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we open some challenging research questions about the design of detection algorithms robust to deception techniques.	Semantic Scholar
Search result diversification aims at returning diversified document lists to cover different user intents of a query.	Semantic Scholar
Existing diversity measures assume that the intents of a query are disjoint, and do not consider their relationships.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we introduce intent hierarchies to model the relationships between intents, and present four weighing schemes.	Semantic Scholar
Based on intent hierarchies, we propose several hierarchical measures that take into account the relationships between intents.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the feasibility of hierarchical measures by using a new test collection based on TREC Web Track 2009-2013 diversity test collections and by using NTCIR-11 IMine test collection.	Semantic Scholar
Our main experimental findings are: (1) Hierarchical measures are more discriminative and intuitive than existing measures.	Semantic Scholar
In terms of intuitiveness, it is preferable for hierarchical measures to use the whole intent hierarchies than to use only the leaf nodes.	Semantic Scholar
(2) The types of intent hierarchies used affect the discriminative power and intuitiveness of hierarchical measures.	Semantic Scholar
We suggest the best type of intent hierarchies to be used according to whether the nonuniform weights are available.	Semantic Scholar
(3) To measure the benefits of the diversification algorithms which use automatically mined hierarchical intents, it is important to use hierarchical measures instead of existing measures.	Semantic Scholar
The hard problem of consciousness is the problem of explaining how we experience qualia or phenomenal experiences, such as seeing, hearing, and feeling, and knowing what they are.	Semantic Scholar
To solve this problem, a theory of consciousness needs to link brain to mind by modeling how emergent properties of several brain mechanisms interacting together embody detailed properties of individual conscious psychological experiences.	Semantic Scholar
This article summarizes evidence that Adaptive Resonance Theory, or ART, accomplishes this goal.	Semantic Scholar
ART is a cognitive and neural theory of how advanced brains autonomously learn to attend, recognize, and predict objects and events in a changing world.	Semantic Scholar
"ART has predicted that ""all conscious states are resonant states"" as part of its specification of mechanistic links between processes of consciousness, learning, expectation, attention, resonance, and synchrony."	Semantic Scholar
It hereby provides functional and mechanistic explanations of data ranging from individual spikes and their synchronization to the dynamics of conscious perceptual, cognitive, and cognitive-emotional experiences.	Semantic Scholar
ART has reached sufficient maturity to begin classifying the brain resonances that support conscious experiences of seeing, hearing, feeling, and knowing.	Semantic Scholar
Psychological and neurobiological data in both normal individuals and clinical patients are clarified by this classification.	Semantic Scholar
This analysis also explains why not all resonances become conscious, and why not all brain dynamics are resonant.	Semantic Scholar
The global organization of the brain into computationally complementary cortical processing streams (complementary computing), and the organization of the cerebral cortex into characteristic layers of cells (laminar computing), figure prominently in these explanations of conscious and unconscious processes.	Semantic Scholar
Alternative models of consciousness are also discussed.	Semantic Scholar

This letter investigates the effect of the surface texture of soft deformable fingertips on the maximum resistible force under dry and wet conditions, and proposes a new hybrid structure that provides a stable grasp under both conditions.	Semantic Scholar
One definition of stable grasp is the capability of balancing a large external force or moment while grasping.	Semantic Scholar
For soft fingertips, both the friction and surface deformation contribute to the stability.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we investigate the maximum resistible force, which is defined as the maximum tangential force at which the fingertip can maintain contact when applying and increasing the tangential/shear force.	Semantic Scholar
We investigate the slit textures with primitive patterns and demonstrate that the nonpattern performs the best under dry conditions, whereas the horizontal slit pattern performs the best under wet (oily) conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this, a concentric hybrid texture of the two patterns is proposed, and its effectiveness is verified by a grasping test.	Semantic Scholar
We study the problem of segmenting moving objects in unconstrained videos.	Semantic Scholar
Given a video, the task is to segment all the objects that exhibit independent motion in at least one frame.	Semantic Scholar
We formulate this as a learning problem and design our framework with three cues: (1) independent object motion between a pair of frames, which complements object recognition, (2) object appearance, which helps to correct errors in motion estimation, and (3) temporal consistency, which imposes additional constraints on the segmentation.	Semantic Scholar
The framework is a two-stream neural network with an explicit memory module.	Semantic Scholar
The two streams encode appearance and motion cues in a video sequence respectively, while the memory module captures the evolution of objects over time, exploiting the temporal consistency.	Semantic Scholar
The motion stream is a convolutional neural network trained on synthetic videos to segment independently moving objects in the optical flow field.	Semantic Scholar
The module to build a “visual memory” in video, i.e., a joint representation of all the video frames, is realized with a convolutional recurrent unit learned from a small number of training video sequences.	Semantic Scholar
For every pixel in a frame of a test video, our approach assigns an object or background label based on the learned spatio-temporal features as well as the “visual memory” specific to the video.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our method extensively on three benchmarks, DAVIS, Freiburg-Berkeley motion segmentation dataset and SegTrack.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we provide an extensive ablation study to investigate both the choice of the training data and the influence of each component in the proposed framework.	Semantic Scholar
Retriggerable and non-retriggerable monostable multivibrators are simple timers with a single characteristic, their period.	Semantic Scholar
Motivated by the fact that monostable multivibrators are implementable in large quantities as counters in digital programmable hardware, we set out to investigate their applicability as building blocks of artificial neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
We derive the nonlinear input-output firing rate relations for single multivibrator neurons as well as the equilibrium firing rate of large recurrent networks.	Semantic Scholar
We show that in rate-encoded monostable multivibrators networks the synaptic weights are tunable as the period ratio of connected units, and thus reconfigurable at run time in a counter-based digital implementation.	Semantic Scholar
This is illustrated with the task of handwritten digit recognition.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we show in a task-independent manner that networks of monostable multivibrators are capable of nonlinear separation, when operating directly on pulse streams.	Semantic Scholar
Our research implies that pulse-coupled neural networks with excitable neurons showing a delayed response can perform computations even when working solely with suprathreshold pulses.	Semantic Scholar

Models of associative memory with discrete-strength synapses are palimpsests, learning new memories by forgetting old ones.	Semantic Scholar
Memory lifetimes can be defined by the mean first passage time (MFPT) for a perceptron's activation to fall below firing threshold.	Semantic Scholar
By imposing the condition that the vector of possible strengths available to a synapse is a left eigenvector of the stochastic matrix governing transitions in strength, we previously derived results for MFPTs and first passage time (FPT) distributions in models with simple, multistate synapses.	Semantic Scholar
This condition permits jump moments to be computed via a 1-dimensional Fokker-Planck approach.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we study memory lifetimes in the absence of this condition.	Semantic Scholar
To do so, we must introduce additional variables, including the perceptron activation, that parameterize synaptic configurations, permitting Markovian dynamics in these variables to be formulated.	Semantic Scholar
FPT problems in these variables require solving multidimensional partial differential or integral equations.	Semantic Scholar
However, the FPT dynamics can be analytically well approximated by focusing on the slowest eigenmode in this higher-dimensional space.	Semantic Scholar
We may also obtain a much better approximation by restricting to the two dominant variables in this space, the restriction making numerical methods tractable.	Semantic Scholar
Analytical and numerical methods are in excellent agreement with simulation data, validating our methods.	Semantic Scholar
These methods prepare the ground for the study of FPT memory lifetimes with complex rather than simple, multistate synapses.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a robotic system where the gear-ratio of an actuator is dynamically changed to either leverage or attenuate the natural load dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this principle, lightweight robotic systems can be made fast and strong; exploiting the natural load dynamics for moving at higher speeds (small reduction ratio), while also able to bear a large load through the attenuation of the load dynamics (large reduction ratio).	Semantic Scholar

We propose a novel rotor safety mechanism for rotary-wing small unmanned aerial vehicles, such as quadrotors, that avoids problems associated with cages, rotor shrouds, and obstacle avoidance safety systems.	Semantic Scholar
The system works by using a passively spinning hoop as a mechanical interference sensor; changes in hoop speed are detected with a reflective IR sensor, which triggers an electrodynamic braking circuit.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments demonstrated that the system can rapidly detect incipient collisions and bring the rotors of a retrofitted DJI Phantom 3 to a halt from flight speed within 0.06 s of contact.	Semantic Scholar
In testing with finger proxies and surface collisions, the safety rotor provided an effective mechanism for reducing the severity of rotor injuries during impact.	Semantic Scholar
We present a comprehensive framework of search methods, such as simulated annealing and batch training, for solving nonconvex optimization problems.	Semantic Scholar
These methods search a wider range by gradually decreasing the randomness added to the standard gradient descent method.	Semantic Scholar
The formulation that we define on the basis of this framework can be directly applied to neural network training.	Semantic Scholar
This produces an effective approach that gradually increases batch size during training.	Semantic Scholar
We also explain why large batch training degrades generalization performance, which previous studies have not clarified.	Semantic Scholar
This letter aims at refined error analysis for binary classification using support vector machine (SVM) with gaussian kernel and convex loss.	Semantic Scholar
Our first result shows that for some loss functions, such as the truncated quadratic loss and quadratic loss, SVM with gaussian kernel can reach the almost optimal learning rate provided the regression function is smooth.	Semantic Scholar
Our second result shows that for a large number of loss functions, under some Tsybakov noise assumption, if the regression function is infinitely smooth, then SVM with gaussian kernel can achieve the learning rate of order , where is the number of samples.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we consider the problem of prescribed time scale robot navigation.	Semantic Scholar
Initially, we treat the problem for a special class of configuration spaces, namely, sphere worlds, proposing a time-varying control scheme that drives the robot from any initial condition to an arbitrary neighborhood of any desired configuration within a predetermined time span, and at the same time prevents any collisions with the obstacles and the workspace boundary along the way.	Semantic Scholar
The introduction of a novel vector field allows us to establish the safety of the system and simultaneously apply the prescribed performance control technique to guarantee any predefined transient behavior.	Semantic Scholar
Subsequently, we leverage well-established transformations to apply the proposed scheme to the far more practical class of generalized sphere worlds.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we validate the theoretical findings via a numerical simulation.	Semantic Scholar
In the paper, we propose a class of dynamic conditional Gaussian graphical models (DCGGMs) based on a set of non-identical distribution observations, which changes smoothly with time or condition.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, the DCGGMs model the dynamic output network influenced by conditioning input variables, which are encoded by a set of varying parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we propose a joint smooth graphical Lasso to estimate the DCGGMs, which combines kernel smoother with sparse group Lasso penalty.	Semantic Scholar
At the same time, we design an efficient accelerated proximal gradient algorithm to solve this estimator.	Semantic Scholar
Theoretically, we establish the asymptotic properties of our model on consistency and sparsistency under the high-dimensional settings.	Semantic Scholar

In order to provide a numerical description of the robots behavior, chaotic measures are estimated on the attractor reconstructed from the recorded positions of the agent.	Semantic Scholar
Chaos theory provides a rigorous mathematical framework consistent with an antireductionist approach, useful for understanding embodied and situated systems while avoiding a decomposition of the integrated system brainbody-environment.	Semantic Scholar
Time series are analyzed in detail using nonlinear mathematical tools in order to verify the presence of low-dimensional deterministic dynamical systems, a fundamental prerequisite for chaos theory.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the recorded time series are evaluated with nonlinear prediction error to unveil deterministic dynamics, cross-prediction error to determine the stationarity of the signal, and surrogate data testing to verify the existence of nonlinear components in the underlying system.

Estimators for quantifying level of chaos and fractal dimension are applied to suitable datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that robots governed by a chaotic dynamic are more efficient at adapting to environments never experience during evolution, demonstrating robustness towards novel and Email address: federico.darold@plymouth.ac.uk (Federico Da Rold) Preprint submitted to Elsevier June 24, 2017 unpredictable situations.

Furthermore, chaotic measures, in particular fractal dimension, are correlated with the performance if robots exhibit a similar behavioral strategy.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a method to perform time series prediction based on perturbation theory.	Semantic Scholar
The approach is based on continuously adjusting an initial forecasting model to asymptotically approximate a desired time series model.	Semantic Scholar
First, a predictive model generates an initial forecasting for a time series.	Semantic Scholar
Second, a residual time series is calculated as the difference between the original time series and the initial forecasting.	Semantic Scholar
If that residual series is not white noise, then it can be used to improve the accuracy of the initial model and a new predictive model is adjusted using residual series.	Semantic Scholar
The whole process is repeated until convergence or the residual series becomes white noise.	Semantic Scholar
The output of the method is then given by summing up the outputs of all trained predictive models in a perturbative sense.	Semantic Scholar
To test the method, an experimental investigation was conducted on six real world time series.	Semantic Scholar
A comparison was made with six other methods experimented and ten other results found in the literature.	Semantic Scholar
Results show that not only the performance of the initial model is significantly improved but also the proposed method outperforms the other results previously published.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a method for tracking a 3D textureless object which undergoes elastic deformations, using the point cloud data provided by an RGB-D sensor and in real-time.	Semantic Scholar
This solution is expected to be useful for enhanced manipulation of humanoid robotic systems, especially in the case of pizza dough to be ideally manipulated by a pizza chef robot.	Semantic Scholar
Our tracking framework relies on a prior visual segmentation of the object in the image.	Semantic Scholar
The segmented point cloud is registered first in a rigid manner and then by non-rigidly fitting the mesh, based on the Finite Element Method to model elasticity, and on geometrical point-to-point correspondences to compute external forces exerted on themesh.	Semantic Scholar

Edge/structure-preserving operations for images aim to smooth images without blurring the edges/structures.	Semantic Scholar
Many exemplary edge-preserving filtering methods have recently been proposed to reduce the computational complexity and/or separate structures of different scales.	Semantic Scholar
They normally adopt a user-selected scale measurement to control the detail smoothing.	Semantic Scholar
However, natural photos contain objects of different sizes, which cannot be described by a single scale measurement.	Semantic Scholar
On the other hand, contour analysis is closely related to edge-preserving filtering, and significant progress has recently been achieved.	Semantic Scholar
Nevertheless, the majority of state-of-the-art filtering techniques have ignored the successes in this area.	Semantic Scholar
Inspired by the fact that learning-based edge detectors significantly outperform traditional manually-designed detectors, this paper proposes a learning-based edge-preserving filtering technique.	Semantic Scholar
It synergistically combines the differential operations in edge-preserving filters with the effectiveness of the recent edge detectors for scale-aware filtering.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike previous filtering methods, the proposed filters can efficiently extract subjectively meaningful structures from natural scenes containing multiple-scale objects.	Semantic Scholar
Grasping objects that are too large to envelop is traditionally achieved using friction that is activated by squeezing.	Semantic Scholar
We present a family of shear-activated grippers that can grasp such objects without the need to squeeze.	Semantic Scholar
When a shear force is applied to the gecko-inspired material in our grippers, adhesion is turned on; this adhesion in turn results in adhesion-controlled friction, a friction force that depends on adhesion rather than a squeezing normal force.	Semantic Scholar
Removal of the shear force eliminates adhesion, allowing easy release of an object.	Semantic Scholar
A compliant shear-activated gripper without active sensing and control can use the same light touch to lift objects that are soft, brittle, fragile, light, or very heavy.	Semantic Scholar
We present three grippers, the first two designed for curved objects, and the third for nearly any shape.	Semantic Scholar
Simple models describe the grasping process, and empirical results verify the models.	Semantic Scholar
The grippers are demonstrated on objects with a variety of shapes, materials, sizes, and weights.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a robust method to handle kinematic and algorithmic singularities of any kinematically redundant robot under task-space hierarchical control with ordered equalities and inequalities.	Semantic Scholar
Our main idea is to exploit a second order model of the nonlinear kinematic function, in the sense of the Newton's method in optimization.	Semantic Scholar
The second order information is provided by a hierarchical BFGS algorithm omitting the heavy computation required for the true Hessian.	Semantic Scholar
In the absence of singularities, which is robustly detected, we use the Gauss-Newton algorithm that has quadratic convergence.	Semantic Scholar
In all cases, we keep a least-squares formulation enabling good computation performances.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach is demonstrated in simulation with a simple robot and a humanoid robot, and compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Spiking neural P systems (SNP systems, in short) are a class of distributed parallel computing systems inspired from the neurophysiological behavior of biological spiking neurons.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we investigate a new variant of SNP systems in which each neuron has one or more synaptic channels, called spiking neural P systems with multiple channels (SNP-MC systems, in short).	Semantic Scholar
The spiking rules with channel label are introduced to handle the firing mechanism of neurons, where the channel labels indicate synaptic channels of transmitting the generated spikes.	Semantic Scholar
The computation power of SNP-MC systems is investigated.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we prove that SNP-MC systems are Turing universal as both number generating and number accepting devices.	Semantic Scholar
Vibrotactile feedback has long been used to improve the human motor learning process through information transfer.	Semantic Scholar
However, in most of the approaches described in the literature, only the joint angles of the limb are guided.	Semantic Scholar
To guide motions that involve multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs), the user needs to interpret multiple simultaneous vibrotactile cues (at least one cue per joint), which is difficult.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we guide the position of a user's wrist in space by producing a vibrotactile cue at any place around the wrist by using a vibrotactile illusion known as “Phantom Sensation” (PS).	Semantic Scholar
"In a user study that involved 10 male participants, the vibrotactile cues produced by PS were reasonably accurately located with an average error of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\boldsymbol{7.9^\circ }$</tex-math></inline-formula>."	Semantic Scholar
To maintain consistency between the vibrotactile cue location and the global frame, we measured the user's wrist rotation and adjusted the position of the vibrotactile cue accordingly.	Semantic Scholar
"When rotating their hand, the participants recognized the location of the vibrotactile cue with an average error of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\boldsymbol{9.3^\circ }$ </tex-math></inline-formula>."	Semantic Scholar
By using the proposed feedback paradigm, we guided users’ wrists in space under two conceptual mappings (“push” and “pull”).	Semantic Scholar
This experiment examined the participants’ motion path efficiency (ME), which measures the directness with which the user's wrist moves toward the desired position.	Semantic Scholar
The participants reached the desired positions under the vibrotactile feedback alone.	Semantic Scholar
The average MEs of the “push” and “pull” mappings were 44.3% and 52.4%, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
We will apply the proposed method under the “pull” mapping to guide real life tasks, such as book classification or rehabilitation.	Semantic Scholar
Recent studies have built encoding models in the early visual cortex, and reliable mappings have been made between the low-level visual features of stimuli and brain activities.	Semantic Scholar
However, these mappings are irreversible, so that the features cannot be directly decoded.	Semantic Scholar
To solve this problem, we designed a sparse framework-based encoding model that predicted brain activities from a complete feature representation.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, according to the distribution and activation rules of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1), three key transformations were introduced into the basic feature to improve the model performance.	Semantic Scholar
In this setting, the mapping was simple enough that it could be inverted using a closed-form formula.	Semantic Scholar
Using this mapping, we designed a hybrid identification method based on the support vector machine (SVM), and tested it on a published functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments confirmed the rationality of our encoding model, and the identification accuracies for 2 subjects increased from 92% and 72% to 98% and 92% with the chance level only 0.8%.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we address the estimation, control, navigation and mapping problems to achieve autonomous inspection of penstocks and tunnels using aerial vehicles with on-board sensing and computation.	Semantic Scholar
Penstocks and tunnels have the shape of a generalized cylinder.	Semantic Scholar
They are generally dark and featureless.	Semantic Scholar
State estimation is challenging because range sensors do not yield adequate information and cameras do not work in the dark.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the six degrees of freedom (DOF) pose and velocity can be estimated by fusing information from an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a lidar and a set of cameras.	Semantic Scholar
This letter discusses in detail the range-based estimation part while leaving the details of vision component to our earlier work.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed algorithm relies only on a model of the generalized cylinder and is robust to changes in shape of the tunnel.	Semantic Scholar
The approach is validated through real experiments showing autonomous and shared control, state estimation and environment mapping in the penstock at Center Hill Dam, TN.	Semantic Scholar
To our knowledge, this is the first time autonomous navigation and mapping has been achieved in a penstock without any external infrastructure such GPS or external cameras.	Semantic Scholar
The segmentation of video sequences into foreground and background regions is a low-level process commonly used in video content analysis and smart surveillance applications.	Semantic Scholar
Using a multispectral camera setup can improve this process by providing more diverse data to help identify objects despite adverse imaging conditions.	Semantic Scholar
The registration of several data sources is however not trivial if the appearance of objects produced by each sensor differs substantially.	Semantic Scholar
This problem is further complicated when parallax effects cannot be ignored when using close-range stereo pairs.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we present a new method to simultaneously tackle multispectral segmentation and stereo registration.	Semantic Scholar
Using an iterative procedure, we estimate the labeling result for one problem using the provisional result of the other.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach is based on the alternating minimization of two energy functions that are linked through the use of dynamic priors.	Semantic Scholar
We rely on the integration of shape and appearance cues to find proper multispectral correspondences, and to properly segment objects in low contrast regions.	Semantic Scholar
We also formulate our model as a frame processing pipeline using higher order terms to improve the temporal coherence of our results.	Semantic Scholar

Learning of sensory cues is believed to rely on synchronous pre- and postsynaptic neuronal firing.	Semantic Scholar
Evidence is mounting that such synchronicity is not merely caused by properties of the underlying neuronal network but could also depend on the integrity of gap junctions that connect neurons and astrocytes in networks too.	Semantic Scholar
In this perspective, we set out to investigate the effect of astrocytic gap junctions on perceptual learning, introducing a model for coupled neuron-astrocyte networks.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we focus on the fact that astrocytes are rich of GABA transporters (GATs) which can either uptake or release GABA depending on the astrocyte membrane potential, which is a function of local neural activity.	Semantic Scholar
We show that GABAergic signaling is a crucial component of intracolumnar neuronal synchronization, thereby promoting learning by neurons in the same cell assembly that are activated by a shared sensory cue.	Semantic Scholar
At the same time, we show that this effect can critically depend on astrocytic gap junctions insofar as these latter could synchronize extracellular GABA levels around many neurons and throughout entire cell assemblies.	Semantic Scholar
These results are supported by extensive computational arguments and predict that astrocytic gap junctions could improve perceptual learning by controlling extracellular GABA.	Semantic Scholar
The human finger exhibits fine motor skills that are widely used in daily activities.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, the motion estimation of a moving finger has several potential applications.	Semantic Scholar
Several surface electromyography interfaces have been proposed to estimate finger motion by analyzing finger-related muscles.	Semantic Scholar
However, due to the characteristics of the muscles, they are time-consuming to operate, require precise electrode placement, or are impractical to use.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, a high-density spatial pattern-based finger motion estimation method is proposed that uses a microneedle-based high-density interface.	Semantic Scholar
Microneedles penetrate the highly resistive dead skin layer and make direct contact with the living epidermis, without requiring an additional medium.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, the sensitivity of the proposed interface exceeds that of other conventional interfaces based on traditional electrodes.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, a spatial pattern that aids in motion estimation can be obtained in a small area by using the proposed interface.	Semantic Scholar
Grasping motion estimation, finger joint angle estimation, and finger flexion classification are performed to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed interface and the spatial pattern-based approach.	Semantic Scholar

Motivated by the trend of providing comprehensive knowledge about trajectory data, we study multi-attribute trajectories each of which contains a sequence of time-stamped locations and a set of characteristic attributes.	Semantic Scholar
This enriches the data representation by providing a comprehensive description of moving objects and thus enables new types of queries on moving object trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we consider answering range queries that return trajectories (i) containing particular attribute values and (ii) passing a certain area during the query time.	Semantic Scholar
We integrate standard trajectories and attributes into one unified framework and propose an index structure as well as the query algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The structure is general and flexible in terms of handling both multi-attribute trajectories and standard trajectories, answering a range of queries and supporting update-intensive applications.	Semantic Scholar
The evaluation is conducted in a prototype database system and experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms alternative methods by a factor of 3-10 on a data set of one million real trajectories and synthetic attribute values.	Semantic Scholar

This paper presents a new way of formalizing the coalition structure generation problem (CSG) so that we can apply constraint optimization techniques to it.	Semantic Scholar
Forming effective coalitions is a major research challenge in AI and multi-agent systems.	Semantic Scholar
CSG involves partitioning a set of agents into coalitions to maximize social surplus.	Semantic Scholar
Traditionally, the input of the CSG problem is a black-box function called a characteristic function, which takes a coalition as input and returns the value of the coalition.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, applying constraint optimization techniques to this problem has been infeasible.	Semantic Scholar
However, characteristic functions that appear in practice often can be represented concisely by a set of rules, rather than treating the function as a black box.	Semantic Scholar
Then we can solve the CSG problem more efficiently by directly applying constraint optimization techniques to this compact representation.	Semantic Scholar
We present new formalizations of the CSG problem by utilizing recently developed compact representation schemes for characteristic functions.	Semantic Scholar
We first characterize the complexity of CSG under these representation schemes.	Semantic Scholar
In this context, the complexity is driven more by the number of rules than by the number of agents.	Semantic Scholar
As an initial step toward developing efficient constraint optimization algorithms for solving the CSG problem, we also develop mixed integer programming formulations and show that an off-the-shelf optimization package can perform reasonably well.	Semantic Scholar
Triadic closure is ubiquitous in social networks, which refers to the property among three individuals, A, B, and C, such that if there exist strong ties between A-B and A-C, then there must be a strong or weak tie between B-C. Related to triadic closure, the number of triangles has been extensively studied since it can be effectively used as a metric to analyze the structure and function of a network.	Semantic Scholar

Security and usability have always been a critical problem for HIPs, especially when “accessibility” is a system requirement.	Semantic Scholar
Pure-text HIPs are more favorable from the usability perspective, but they are not secure.	Semantic Scholar
Audio HIPs usually cannot reliably distinguish attacks from legitimate use; they are either easy, and can be automatically solved, or hard, even for humans.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we first compare the usability of a currently used pure-text HIP service, textCAPTCHA, against Google's reCAPTCHA.	Semantic Scholar
After analyzing the results, we propose a new HIP system (SMARTCHA).	Semantic Scholar

Then a specialized Orthant-Wise Limited-memory Quasi-Newton (sOWL-QN) method is employed to perform simultaneous network pruning and parameter optimization in the second phase.	Semantic Scholar
The advantages of TPCLR1 lie in that better generalization performance is guaranteed with higher model sparsity, and the required storage space and testing time are much reduced.	Semantic Scholar
Besides these, only the regularization parameter and the maximum number of function evaluations are required to be prescribed, then the entire construction procedure becomes automatic.	Semantic Scholar
The learning algorithm is verified by several classification benchmarks with different levels of complexity.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results show that an appropriate value of the regularization parameter is easy to find without using costly cross validation, and the proposed TPCLR1 offers an efficient procedure to construct sparse RBFNN classifiers with good generalization performance.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a new wearable device for human joint impedance estimation.	Semantic Scholar
The device utilizes snap-through buckling of closed-elastica to impose perturbations on human joints.	Semantic Scholar
Actuation is based on the law of momentum conservation, that is, the proposed device induces an impact on human joint dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
The snap-through buckling generates a comparatively high velocity even with small actuators, and thus, the device is significantly lighter in weight and more compact compared to conventional systems.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, it can impose a torque perturbation on a human joint within a sufficiently short time period.	Semantic Scholar
Because of the perturbation in the short period, the estimation algorithm also developed in this letter enables us to consider the resulting response as an impulse response, and thereby no synchronization between the input–output data is required.	Semantic Scholar
We conduct pilot tests to verify the proposed method for ankle joint impedance estimation and discuss the basic performance of this method compared to the related work.	Semantic Scholar
We also discuss the viability of using this method for a variety of purposes in human joint impedance estimation.	Semantic Scholar
Anomalous event detection is of utmost importance in intelligent video surveillance.	Semantic Scholar
Currently, most approaches for the automatic analysis of complex video scenes typically rely on hand-crafted appearance and motion features.	Semantic Scholar
However, adopting user defined representations is clearly suboptimal, as it is desirable to learn descriptors specific to the scene of interest.	Semantic Scholar
To cope with this need, in this paper we propose Appearance and Motion DeepNet (AMDN), a novel approach based on deep neural networks to automatically learn feature representations.	Semantic Scholar
To exploit the complementary information of both appearance and motion patterns, we introduce a novel double fusion framework, combining the benefits of traditional early fusion and late fusion strategies.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, stacked denoising autoencoders are proposed to separately learn both appearance and motion features as well as a joint representation (early fusion).	Semantic Scholar
Then, based on the learned features, multiple one-class SVM models are used to predict the anomaly scores of each input.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, a novel late fusion strategy is proposed to combine the computed scores and detect abnormal events.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed ADMN is extensively evaluated on publicly available video surveillance datasets, showing competitive performance with respect to state of the art approaches.	Semantic Scholar

This paper also describes the design criteria, hardware, software framework, and experimental testing of the DRC-HUBO+ platform.	Semantic Scholar
The purpose of DRC-HUBO+ is to perform tasks by teleoperation in hazardous environments that are unsafe for humans, such as disaster zones.	Semantic Scholar
We identified specific design concepts for DRC-HUBO+ to achieve this goal.	Semantic Scholar
For a robot to be capable of performing human tasks, a human-like shape and size, autonomy, mobility, manipulability, and power are required, among other features.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, modularized joints and a user-friendly software framework were emphasized as design concepts to facilitate research on the robot tasks.	Semantic Scholar
The DRC-HUBO+ platform is based on DRC-HUBO-1 and HUBO-2.	Semantic Scholar
The torque of each joint is increased compared to that in DRC-HUBO-1 owing to its high reduction ratio and air-cooling system.	Semantic Scholar
DRC-HUBO+ is designed with an exoskeletal structure to provide it with sufficient stiffness relative to its mass.	Semantic Scholar

DRC-HUBO+ has 32 degrees of freedom (DOFs), including seven DOFs for each arm and six DOFs for each leg, and a solid and light body with a height of 170 cm and a mass of 80 kg.	Semantic Scholar
A software framework referred to as PODO, with a Linux kernel and the Xenomai patch, is used in DRC-HUBO+.	Semantic Scholar
Human pose estimation is a challenging task due to significant appearance variations.	Semantic Scholar
An ensemble of models, each of which is optimized for a limited variety of poses, is capable of modeling a large variety of human body configurations.However, ensembling models is not a straightforward task due to the complex interdependence among noisy and ambiguous pose estimation predictions acquired by each model.We propose to capture this complex interdependence using a convolutional neural network.	Semantic Scholar
Our network achieves this interdependence representation using a combination of deep convolution and deconvolution layers for robust and accurate pose estimation.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate the proposed ensemble model on publicly available datasets and show that our model compares favorably against baseline models and state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
Developmental dysgraphia, being observed among 10–30% of school-aged children, is a disturbance or difficulty in the production of written language that has to do with the mechanics of writing.	Semantic Scholar
The objective of this study is to propose a method that can be used for automated diagnosis of this disorder, as well as for estimation of difficulty level as determined by the handwriting proficiency screening questionnaire.	Semantic Scholar
We used a digitizing tablet to acquire handwriting and consequently employed a complex parameterization in order to quantify its kinematic aspects and hidden complexities.	Semantic Scholar
We also introduced a simple intrawriter normalization that increased dysgraphia discrimination and HPSQ estimation accuracies.	Semantic Scholar
Using a random forest classifier, we reached 96% sensitivity and specificity, while in the case of automated rating by the HPSQ total score, we reached 10% estimation error.	Semantic Scholar
This study proves that digital parameterization of pressure and altitude/tilt patterns in children with dysgraphia can be used for preliminary diagnosis of this writing disorder.	Semantic Scholar

The exact manner in which control is shared between a human and an autonomous system is a crucial factor for assistive robots that provide physical support to people with severe motor impairments.	Semantic Scholar
There has however been little comparative study between different control-sharing paradigms within the field of assistive robotics.	Semantic Scholar
We present a control architecture for a robotic ‘‘smart’’ wheelchair that allows for the seamless interchange and evaluation of any number of control-sharing paradigms, and so facilitates comparative study between them.We present an implementation of four control sharing paradigms, and results from a study that compares all four to each other and teleoperation, and moreover using multiple control interfaces and across multiple sessions.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results suggest that (i) task performance metrics differ with each control interface, (ii) performance increaseswith increasing autonomy assistance however it is not statistically significantly different between higher levels of autonomy, (iii) metrics related to user effort show a decrease with increasing autonomy, which is more emphasized with more limited control interface and (iv) how much the autonomy is utilized differs greatly between control paradigms, but not control interfaces.

Moreover, (v) for almost all performance metrics, there is a consistent performance increase in Session 2 compared to Session 1, and for both control interfaces.	Semantic Scholar
Lastly, subjective questionnaires (control paradigm preference and perceived utility) reveal both similarities and differences between SCI and uninjured subjects.	Semantic Scholar
No single control paradigm is the clear winner in performance or preference, suggesting that itwill be important to offer end-usersmultiple control options to accommodate their individual needs and preferences.	Semantic Scholar

The Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension (VC-dim) characterizes the sample learning complexity of a classification model and it is often used as an indicator for the generalization capability of a learning method.	Semantic Scholar
The VC-dim has been studied on common feed-forward neural networks, but it has yet to be studied on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recursive Neural Networks (RecNNs).	Semantic Scholar
This paper provides upper bounds on the order of growth of the VC-dim of GNNs and RecNNs.	Semantic Scholar
GNNs and RecNNs are from a new class of neural network models which are capable of processing inputs that are given as graphs.	Semantic Scholar
A graph is a data structure that generalizes the representational power of vectors and sequences, via the ability to represent dependencies or relationships between feature vectors.	Semantic Scholar
It was shown previously that the ability of recurrent neural networks to process sequences increases the VC-dim when compared to the VC-dim of Neural Networks, which are limited to processing vectors.	Semantic Scholar
Since graphs are a more general form than sequences, the question arises how this will affect the VC-dimension of GNNs and RecNNs.	Semantic Scholar
A main finding in this paper is that the upper bounds on the VC-dim for GNNs and RecNNs are comparable to the upper bounds for recurrent neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
The result also suggests that the generalization capability of such models increases with the number of connected nodes.	Semantic Scholar

We present a method for estimating visual and haptic force feedback on robotic surgical systems that currently do not include significant force feedback for the operator.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach permits to compute contact forces between instruments and tissues without additional sensors, relying only on endoscopic images acquired by a stereoscopic camera.	Semantic Scholar
Using an underlying biomechanical model built on-the-fly from the organ shape and by considering the surgical tool as boundary conditions acting on the surface of the model, contact force can be estimated at the tip of the tool.	Semantic Scholar
At the same time, these constraints generate stresses that permit to compose a new endoscopic image as visual feedback for the surgeon.	Semantic Scholar
The results are demonstrated on in vivo sequences of a human liver during robotic surgery, whereas quantitative validation is performed on a DejaVu and ex vivo experimentation with ground truth to show the advantage of our approach.	Semantic Scholar

The increasing interest in collecting and publishing large amounts of individuals’ data as public for purposes such as medical research, market analysis, and economical measures has created major privacy concerns about individual's sensitive information.	Semantic Scholar
To deal with these concerns, many Privacy-Preserving Data Publishing (PPDP) techniques have been proposed in literature.	Semantic Scholar
However, they lack a proper privacy characterization and measurement.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we first present a novel multi-variable privacy characterization and quantification model.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this model, we are able to analyze the prior and posterior adversarial belief about attribute values of individuals.	Semantic Scholar
We can also analyze the sensitivity of any identifier in privacy characterization.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we show that privacy should not be measured based on one metric.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate how this could result in privacy misjudgment.	Semantic Scholar
We propose two different metrics for quantification of privacy leakage, distribution leakage, and entropy leakage.	Semantic Scholar
"Using these metrics, we analyzed some of the most well-known PPDP techniques such as <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$</tex-math> <alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""ibrahim-ieq1-2797092.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula>-anonymity, <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$l$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""ibrahim-ieq2-2797092.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula>-diversity, and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$t$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""ibrahim-ieq3-2797092.gif""/> </alternatives></inline-formula>-closeness."	Semantic Scholar
Based on our framework and the proposed metrics, we can determine that all the existing PPDP schemes have limitations in privacy characterization.	Semantic Scholar
Our proposed privacy characterization and measurement framework contributes to better understanding and evaluation of these techniques.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, this paper provides a foundation for design and analysis of PPDP schemes.	Semantic Scholar

Employing Brouwer's and Leray-Schauder's fixed point theorems, suitable Lyapunov functionals and impulsive control theory, sufficient conditions are given for the existence of 16n attractors, showing a substantial improvement in storage capacity, compared to real-valued or complex-valued neural networks.

This letter presents a novel planning and control approach for autonomous excavation that is independent of the soil composition and goes beyond a single dig.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to the existing work, which is mostly based on position trajectories for the bucket motion, we define a single dig cycle directly by an end-effector force–torque trajectory.	Semantic Scholar
This trajectory applied to different types of soil, resulting in bucket motions that are used by expert operators to adapt to different terrain.	Semantic Scholar
Thereby, we can overcome the limitations of current approaches that suffer from the fact that soil interaction forces are dominant and immensely hard to predict or estimate.	Semantic Scholar
The end-effector forces and motion of the redundant excavator arm are controlled using a hierarchical optimization approach.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, a large-scale iterative planner is proposed to consecutively execute single digs until a desired ground geometry is achieved.	Semantic Scholar
The shown simulation results include multidig excavations that precisely recreate the desired ground shapes.	Semantic Scholar

Multiagent systems are characterized by decentralized decision-making by the (semi)autonomous agents and localized communication or information exchange among the neighboring agents.	Semantic Scholar
Supply–demand networks form the backbones of both services and manufacturing industries, and need to operate as efficiently as possible to yield optimized returns.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we bring the notion of multiagent systems to clustered supply–demand networks such that each supplier acts as an agent.	Semantic Scholar
Consequently, we adapt consensus-based auction bidding methods to optimize the assignment of demands to the suppliers with known communication pathways and resource constraints.	Semantic Scholar
Results on moderately large networks show promising performance in terms of both assignment quality, as given by the overall demand delivery cost and proportion of assigned demands, and computation time.	Semantic Scholar
For a driving simulator to be a valid tool for research, vehicle development, or driver training, it is crucial that it elicits similar driver behavior as the corresponding real vehicle.	Semantic Scholar
To assess such behavioral validity, the use of quantitative driver models has been suggested but not previously reported.	Semantic Scholar
Here, a task-general conceptual driver model is proposed, along with a taxonomy defining levels of behavioral validity.	Semantic Scholar
Based on these theoretical concepts, it is argued that driver models without explicit representations of sensory or neuromuscular dynamics should be sufficient for a model-based assessment of driving simulators in most contexts.	Semantic Scholar
As a task-specific example, two parsimonious driver steering models of this nature are developed and tested on a dataset of real and simulated driving in near-limit, low-friction circumstances, indicating a clear preference of one model over the other.	Semantic Scholar
By means of closed-loop simulations, it is demonstrated that the parameters of this preferred model can generally be accurately estimated from unperturbed driver steering data, using a simple, open-loop fitting method, as long as the vehicle positioning data are reliable.	Semantic Scholar
Some recurring patterns between the two studied tasks are noted in how the model's parameters, fitted to human steering, are affected by the presence or absence of steering torques and motion cues in the simulator.	Semantic Scholar
Humans use multiple muscles to generate such joint movements as an elbow motion.	Semantic Scholar
With multiple lightweight and compliant actuators, joint movements can also be efficiently generated.	Semantic Scholar
Similarly, robots can use multiple actuators to efficiently generate a one degree of freedom movement.	Semantic Scholar
For this movement, the desired joint torque must be properly distributed to each actuator.	Semantic Scholar
One approach to cope with this torque distribution problem is an optimal control method.	Semantic Scholar
However, solving the optimal control problem at each control time step has not been deemed a practical approach due to its large computational burden.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient method to derive an optimal control strategy for a hybrid actuation system composed of multiple actuators, where each actuator has different dynamical properties.	Semantic Scholar
We investigated a singularly perturbed system of the hybrid actuator model that subdivided the original large-scale control problem into smaller subproblems so that the optimal control outputs for each actuator can be derived at each control time step and applied our proposed method to our pneumatic-electric hybrid actuator system.	Semantic Scholar
Our method derived a torque distribution strategy for the hybrid actuator by dealing with the difficulty of solving real-time optimal control problems.	Semantic Scholar

Humans possess a remarkable ability to rapidly form coarse estimations of numerical averages.	Semantic Scholar
This ability is important for making decisions that are based on streams of numerical or value-based information, as well as for preference formation.	Semantic Scholar
Nonetheless, the mechanism underlying rapid approximate numerical averaging remains unknown, and several competing mechanism may account for it.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we tested the hypothesis that approximate numerical averaging relies on perceptual-like processes, instantiated by population coding.	Semantic Scholar
Participants were presented with rapid sequences of numerical values (four items per second) and were asked to convey the sequence average.	Semantic Scholar
We manipulated the sequences' length, variance, and mean magnitude and found that similar to perceptual averaging, the precision of the estimations improves with the length and deteriorates with (higher) variance or (higher) magnitude.	Semantic Scholar
To account for the results, we developed a biologically plausible population-coding model and showed that it is mathematically equivalent to a population vector.	Semantic Scholar
Using both quantitative and qualitative model comparison methods, we compared the population-coding model to several competing models, such as a step-by-step running average (based on leaky integration) and a midrange model.	Semantic Scholar
We found that the data support the population-coding model.	Semantic Scholar
We conclude that humans' ability to rapidly form estimations of numerical averages has many properties of the perceptual (intuitive) system rather than the arithmetic, linguistic-based (analytic) system and that population coding is likely to be its underlying mechanism.	Semantic Scholar

Non-negative matrix factorization based multi-view clustering algorithms have shown their competitiveness among different multi-view clustering algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
However, non-negative matrix factorization fails to preserve the locally geometrical structure of the data space.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a multi-manifold regularized non-negative matrix factorization framework (MMNMF) which can preserve the locally geometrical structure of the manifolds for multi-view clustering.	Semantic Scholar
MMNMF incorporates consensus manifold and consensus coefficient matrix with multi-manifold regularization to preserve the locally geometrical structure of the multi-view data space.	Semantic Scholar
We use two methods to construct the consensus manifold and two methods to find the consensus coefficient matrix, which leads to four instances of the framework.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing non-negative matrix factorization based algorithms for multi-view clustering.	Semantic Scholar
Traditional cluster ensemble approaches have several limitations.	Semantic Scholar
(1) Few make use of prior knowledge provided by experts.	Semantic Scholar
(2) It is difficult to achieve good performance in high-dimensional datasets.	Semantic Scholar
(3) All of the weight values of the ensemble members are equal, which ignores different contributions from different ensemble members.	Semantic Scholar
(4) Not all pairwise constraints contribute to the final result.	Semantic Scholar
In the face of this situation, we propose double weighting semi-supervised ensemble clustering based on selected constraint projection(DCECP) which applies constraint weighting and ensemble member weighting to address these limitations.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, DCECP first adopts the random subspace technique in combination with the constraint projection procedure to handle high-dimensional datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Second, it treats prior knowledge of experts as pairwise constraints, and assigns different subsets of pairwise constraints to different ensemble members.	Semantic Scholar
An adaptive ensemble member weighting process is designed to associate different weight values with different ensemble members.	Semantic Scholar
Third, the weighted normalized cut algorithm is adopted to summarize clustering solutions and generate the final result.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, nonparametric statistical tests are used to compare multiple algorithms on real-world datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Our experiments on 15 high-dimensional datasets show that DCECP performs better than most clustering algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
For human pose estimation in still images, this paper proposes three semiand weakly-supervised learning schemes.	Semantic Scholar
While recent advances of convolutional neural networks improve human pose estimation using supervised training data, our focus is to explore the semiand weakly-supervised schemes.	Semantic Scholar
Our proposed schemes initially learn conventional model(s) for pose estimation from a small amount of standard training images with human pose annotations.	Semantic Scholar
For the first semi-supervised learning scheme, this conventional pose model detects candidate poses in training images with no human annotation.	Semantic Scholar
From these candidate poses, only true-positives are selected by a classifier using a pose feature representing the configuration of all body parts.	Semantic Scholar
The accuracies of these candidate pose estimation and true-positive pose selection are improved by action labels provided to these images in our second and third learning schemes, which are semiand weakly-supervised learning.	Semantic Scholar
While the first and second learning schemes select only poses that are similar to those in the supervised training data, the third scheme selects more true-positive poses that are significantly different from any supervised poses.	Semantic Scholar
This pose selection is achieved by pose clustering using outlier pose detection with Dirichlet process mixtures and the Bayes factor.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed schemes are validated with large-scale human pose datasets.	Semantic Scholar
A light-field camera can obtain richer information about a scene than a usual camera.	Semantic Scholar
This property offers a lot of potential for robot vision.	Semantic Scholar

The light-field camera can be regarded as a set of subaperture cameras.	Semantic Scholar
Although any combination of them can theoretically be used for the pose estimation, the accuracy depends on the combination.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the estimated pose error can be reduced by selecting the best pair of subaperture cameras.	Semantic Scholar
We have evaluated the accuracy of our approach with real experiments using a light-field camera in front of planar targets held by an industrial manipulator for ground truth comparison.	Semantic Scholar

Ever since the start of aviation, birds and airplanes have posed a mutual risk: Birds are killed when struck by aircraft, but, in return, bird strikes cause billions in damage to the aviation industry.	Semantic Scholar
Airports employ bird-control methods such as audiovisual deterrents (like scarecrows, lasers, and noise), weapons, and chemicals to relocate, suffocate, or otherwise terminate the birds [2].	Semantic Scholar
While the latter methods work, they are ethically questionable.	Semantic Scholar
The problem of audiovisual deterrents is that they quickly lose effectiveness due to habituation.	Semantic Scholar
The approach that works consistently is the use of predator birds to scare off the prey birds and permanently relocate them away from runways.	Semantic Scholar
However, the predators themselves cannot be precisely controlled and, in turn, also pose a threat to airplanes.	Semantic Scholar
Item-to-item collaborative filtering (aka.item-based CF) has been long used for building recommender systems in industrial settings, owing to its interpretability and efficiency in real-time personalization.	Semantic Scholar
It builds a user's profile as her historically interacted items, recommending new items that are similar to the user's profile.	Semantic Scholar
As such, the key to an item-based CF method is in the estimation of item similarities.	Semantic Scholar
Early approaches use statistical measures such as cosine similarity and Pearson coefficient to estimate item similarities, which are less accurate since they lack tailored optimization for the recommendation task.	Semantic Scholar
In recent years, several works attempt to learn item similarities from data, by expressing the similarity as an underlying model and estimating model parameters by optimizing a recommendation-aware objective function.	Semantic Scholar
While extensive efforts have been made to use shallow linear models for learning item similarities, there has been relatively less work exploring nonlinear neural network models for item-based CF.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we propose a neural network model named Neural Attentive Item Similarity model (NAIS) for item-based CF.	Semantic Scholar
The key to our design of NAIS is an attention network, which is capable of distinguishing which historical items in a user profile are more important for a prediction.	Semantic Scholar
Compared to the state-of-the-art item-based CF method Factored Item Similarity Model (FISM) [1] , our NAIS has stronger representation power with only a few additional parameters brought by the attention network.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of NAIS.	Semantic Scholar
This work is the first attempt that designs neural network models for item-based CF, opening up new research possibilities for future developments of neural recommender systems.	Semantic Scholar

These can be employed to synthesize complex walking sequences for humanoid robots online in a very efficient way.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate, for the first time, that COCoMoPL works on a real humanoid robot, here HRP-2 with 36 DOF and 30 position controlled actuators.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, it was necessary to significantly extend the existing approach by including transition steps into the training data, modify the movement primitives (MP) to admit these transitions, improve the representation of the zero moment point MPs and tighten the transition conditions at the beginning and end of steps.

The definition of flight deck information automation was refined to differentiate it from other types of automation.	Semantic Scholar
Pilots interacted with an example information automation system to investigate the premise that automation visibility will have an impact on the ability of pilots to detect problems resulting from poor information quality.	Semantic Scholar
Poor information quality appeared to be difficult for pilots to detect, even when presented with high automation visibility.	Semantic Scholar
Pilots tended to over-trust automation, so when reporting high workload and information was missing, they chose the top plan suggested by the automation even though it was not the best.	Semantic Scholar
Trust in automation was reduced by low information quality, but compensated for by increased automation visibility.	Semantic Scholar
Added information to help pilots understand information automation state and outputs, given a level of information quality, should be balanced against potential increases in pilot workload due to the time and attention needed to process the extra information.	Semantic Scholar

Here, we examine two models, the Hassenstein-Reichardt (HR) model and the two-detector (2D) model.	Semantic Scholar
We analytically obtain the mean and variance of the stationary responses of the HR and the 2D models to white noise, and we derive the signal-to-fluctuation-noise ratio (SFNR) to evaluate encoding abilities of the two models.	Semantic Scholar
Especially when analyzing the 2D model, we calculate higher-order cumulants of a rectified Gaussian.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that the 2D model robustly works almost as well as the HR model in several sets of parameters estimated on the basis of experimental data.	Semantic Scholar
Deep intracranial tumor removal can be achieved if the neurosurgical robot has sufficient flexibility and stability.	Semantic Scholar
Toward achieving this goal, we have developed a spring-based continuum robot, namely a minimally invasive neurosurgical intracranial robot (MINIR-II) with novel tendon routing and tunable stiffness for use in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environment.	Semantic Scholar
The robot consists of a pair of springs in parallel, i.e., an inner interconnected spring that promotes flexibility with decoupled segment motion and an outer spring that maintains its smooth curved shape during its interaction with the tissue.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a shape memory alloy (SMA) spring backbone that provides local stiffness control and a tendon routing configuration that enables independent segment locking.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we also present a detailed local stiffness analysis of the SMA backbone and model the relationship between the resistive force at the robot tip and the tension in the tendon.	Semantic Scholar
We also demonstrate through experiments, the validity of our local stiffness model of the SMA backbone and the correlation between the tendon tension and the resistive force.	Semantic Scholar
We also performed MRI compatibility studies of the three-segment MINIR-II robot by attaching it to a robotic platform that consists of SMA spring actuators with integrated water cooling modules.	Semantic Scholar
We present a novel method for mapping general three-dimensional environments, where sufficient geometric or visual information is not everywhere guaranteed and where the device motion is unconstrained as with handheld systems.	Semantic Scholar
The continuous-time simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm integrates a lidar, camera, and inertial measurement unit in a complementary fashion whereby all sensors contribute constraints to the optimization.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed algorithm is designed to expand the domain of mappable environments and therefore increase the reliability and utility of general purpose mobile mapping.	Semantic Scholar
A key component of the proposed algorithm is the incorporation of depth uncertainty into visual features, which is effective for noisy surfaces and allows features with and without depth estimates to be modeled in a unified manner.	Semantic Scholar
Results demonstrate a wider mappable domain on challenging environments compared to the state-of-the-art lidar or vision-based localization and mapping algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Traditional motion planning approaches for multilegged locomotion divide the problem into several stages, such as contact search and trajectory generation.	Semantic Scholar
However, reasoning about contacts and motions simultaneously is crucial for the generation of complex whole-body behaviors.	Semantic Scholar
Currently, coupling theses problems has required either the assumption of a fixed gait sequence and flat terrain condition, or nonconvex optimization with intractable computation time.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a mixed-integer convex formulation to plan simultaneously contact locations, gait transitions, and motion, in a computationally efficient fashion.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to previous works, our approach is not limited to flat terrain nor to a prespecified gait sequence.	Semantic Scholar
Instead, we incorporate the friction cone stability margin, approximate the robot's torque limits, and plan the gait using mixed-integer convex constraints.	Semantic Scholar
We experimentally validated our approach on the HyQ robot by traversing different challenging terrains, where nonconvexity and flat terrain assumptions might lead to suboptimal or unstable plans.	Semantic Scholar
Our method increases the motion robustness while keeping a low computation time.	Semantic Scholar
Whether robot controllers are manually designed or synthesized from high-level task specifications, assumptions about the environment need to be made, which can involve adversarial events or cooperative robots.	Semantic Scholar
In either case, if these assumptions are violated at runtime, the robot will fail to fulfill its task and will likely do something unexpected.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we focus on controllers synthesized from linear temporal logic.	Semantic Scholar
We tackle the problem of making these controllers robust against environment assumption violations that are common in robot execution.	Semantic Scholar
Our solution is a three-layer system: first, we propose an offline approach that accounts for transient violations such that the robot can still complete its task after temporary anomalies; the second layer is an online approach that automatically relaxes the environment assumptions to better capture environment behaviors and that allows the robot to react accordingly; and, finally, we automatically modify the actual environment behaviors, when possible, through negotiation with one of the environment robots operating in the workspace, such that our assumptions are met by the other robot and both robots accomplish their tasks.	Semantic Scholar
In recent years, Web service discovery has been a hot research topic.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a novel Web services discovery approach, which can mine the underlying semantic structures of interaction interface parameters to help users find and employ Web services, and can match interfaces with high precision when the parameters of those interfaces contain meaningful synonyms, abbreviations, and combinations of disordered fragments.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach is based on mining the underlying semantics.	Semantic Scholar
First, we propose a conceptual Web services description model in which we include the type path for the interaction interface parameters in addition to the traditional text description.	Semantic Scholar
Then, based on this description model, we mine the underlying semantics of the interaction interface to create index libraries by clustering interaction interface names and fragments under the supervision of co-occurrence probability.	Semantic Scholar
This index library can help provide a high-efficiency interface that can match not only synonyms but also abbreviations and fragment combinations.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we propose a Web service Operations Discovery algorithm (OpD).	Semantic Scholar
The OpD discovery results include two types of Web services: services with “Single” operations and services with “Composite” operations.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental evaluation shows that our approach performs better than other Web service discovery methods in terms of both discovery time and precision/recall rate.	Semantic Scholar
Cluster analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is often performed using gaussian mixture models, but when the time series are standardized such that the data reside on a hypersphere, this modeling assumption is questionable.	Semantic Scholar
The consequences of ignoring the underlying spherical manifold are rarely analyzed, in part due to the computational challenges imposed by directional statistics.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we discuss a Bayesian von Mises–Fisher (vMF) mixture model for data on the unit hypersphere and present an efficient inference procedure based on collapsed Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling.	Semantic Scholar
Comparing the vMF and gaussian mixture models on synthetic data, we demonstrate that the vMF model has a slight advantage inferring the true underlying clustering when compared to gaussian-based models on data generated from both a mixture of vMFs and a mixture of gaussians subsequently normalized.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, when performing model selection, the two models are not in agreement.	Semantic Scholar
Analyzing multisubject whole brain resting-state fMRI data from healthy adult subjects, we find that the vMF mixture model is considerably more reliable than the gaussian mixture model when comparing solutions across models trained on different groups of subjects, and again we find that the two models disagree on the optimal number of components.	Semantic Scholar
The analysis indicates that the fMRI data support more than a thousand clusters, and we confirm this is not a result of overfitting by demonstrating better prediction on data from held-out subjects.	Semantic Scholar
Our results highlight the utility of using directional statistics to model standardized fMRI data and demonstrate that whole brain segmentation of fMRI data requires a very large number of functional units in order to adequately account for the discernible statistical patterns in the data.	Semantic Scholar
Nowadays, the most adopted model for the design and control of soft robots is the piecewise constant curvature model, with its consolidated benefits and drawbacks.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, an alternative model for multisection soft manipulator dynamics is presented based on a discrete Cosserat approach, in which the continuous Cosserat model is discretized by assuming a piecewise constant strain along the soft arm.	Semantic Scholar
As a consequence, the soft manipulator state is described by a finite set of constant strains.	Semantic Scholar
This approach has several advantages with respect to the existing models.	Semantic Scholar
First, it takes into account shear and torsional deformations, which are both essential to cope with out-of-plane external loads.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, it inherits desirable geometrical and mechanical properties of the continuous Cosserat model, such as intrinsic parameterization and greater generality.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, this approach allows to extend to soft manipulators, the recursive composite-rigid-body and articulated-body algorithms, whose performances are compared through a cantilever beam simulation.	Semantic Scholar
The soundness of the model is demonstrated through extensive simulation and experimental results.	Semantic Scholar

The ability to explore an unknown environment is an important prerequisite for building truly autonomous robots.	Semantic Scholar
Two central capabilities for autonomous exploration are the selection of the next view point(s) for gathering new observations and robust navigation.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a novel exploration strategy that exploits background knowledge by considering previously seen environments to make better exploration decisions.	Semantic Scholar
We furthermore combine this approach with robust homing so that the robot can navigate back to its starting location even if the mapping system fails and does not produce a consistent map.	Semantic Scholar
We implemented the proposed approach in ROS and thoroughly evaluated it.	Semantic Scholar
The experiments indicate that our method improves the ability of a robot to explore challenging environments as well as the quality of the resulting maps.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the robot is able to navigate back home, even if it cannot rely on its map.	Semantic Scholar
As the human race expands its horizon toward a multiplanetary existence, infrastructures on the target planets have to be constructed and maintained to pave the way for humans.	Semantic Scholar
The support of robotic coworkers plays a key role in setting up habitats, energy supplies, and return vehicles, until the completion of such infrastructures in the hazardous planetary environment.	Semantic Scholar
The operation of these robots require capabilities including autonomy, communication, and human-robot interface design to meet the challenges of the harsh conditions in space deployment.	Semantic Scholar
This letter examines these topics through German Aerospace Center (DLR) and European Space Agency's METERON SUPVIS Justin space telerobotics experiments, during that astronauts on-board the International Space Station command DLR's humanoid robot Rollin’ Justin to survey and maintain a simulated Martian solar farm on Earth.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the first experiments conducted on August 25, 2017, this letter discusses several astronaut–robot collaboration concepts in real space-to-ground deployment and provides preliminary insights for future manned Mars missions.	Semantic Scholar
The 15th International Conference on the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research (CPAIOR) was held in Delft, The Netherlands, from June 26 to June 29, 2018.	Semantic Scholar
It was co-located with the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS).	Semantic Scholar
The aim of the CPAIOR conference is to bring together interested researchers from Constraint Programming (CP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Operations Research (OR) to present new techniques or applications, and to provide an opportunity for researchers in one area to learn about techniques in the others.	Semantic Scholar
A main objective of this conference series is also to give these researchers the opportunity to show how the integration of techniques from different fields can lead to interesting results on large and complex problems.	Semantic Scholar
All papers submitted to the conference were subject to a rigorous peer-review process.	Semantic Scholar
Accepted papers were either formally published in the conference proceedings [1], or invited to be published exclusively through a fast-track process in the Constraints journal.	Semantic Scholar
Only a small selection of outstanding papers was invited to the fast track.	Semantic Scholar
Before being accepted into Constraints, the resulting papers were subject to another round of reviewing to ensure the high standards for this journal.	Semantic Scholar
This issue collects the three papers that were accepted to the fast track: The paper Deep Neural Networks and Mixed Integer Linear Optimization by Matteo Fischetti and Jason Jo studies the use of 0/1 mixed integer linear programming models for deep neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
The paper also analyzes a bound-tightening mechanism, and demonstrates the performance of the 0/1 MILP model on two applications in the context of feature visualization and adversarial machine learning.	Semantic Scholar
Aerial manipulation aims at combining the versatility and the agility of some aerial platforms with the manipulation capabilities of robotic arms.	Semantic Scholar
This letter tries to collect the results reached by the research community so far within the field of aerial manipulation, especially from the technological and control point of view.	Semantic Scholar
A brief literature review of general aerial robotics and space manipulation is carried out as well.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a path planning algorithm for generating a cost-efficient path that satisfies mission requirements specified in linear temporal logic (LTL).	Semantic Scholar
We assume that a cost function is defined over the configuration space.	Semantic Scholar
Examples of a cost function include hazard levels, wireless connectivity, and energy consumption, to name a few.	Semantic Scholar
"The proposed method consists of two parts: sampling-based cost-aware path planning considering the vehicle dynamics based on rapidly-exploring random trees <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\text{(RRT}^{\ast }$</tex-math></inline-formula>), and a high-level logic which determines how to extend the RRT tree based on spatiotemporal specifications of an LTL formula."	Semantic Scholar
"In order to find a low-cost trajectory with computational efficiency, the proposed method expands the RRT tree with long extensions using cross entropy, while the rewiring step of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\text{RRT}^{\ast }$</tex-math></inline-formula> is used to preserve the asymptotic optimality."	Semantic Scholar
In simulation and experiments, we show that the proposed method performs favorably compared to existing methods.	Semantic Scholar
unknown	Semantic Scholar
In contingent planning problems, agents have partial information about their state and use sensing actions to learn the value of some variables.	Semantic Scholar
When sensing and actuation are separated, plans for such problems can often be viewed as a tree of sensing actions, separated by conformant plans consisting of non-sensing actions that enable the execution of the next sensing action.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a heuristic, online method for contingent planning which focuses on identifying the next useful sensing action.	Semantic Scholar
We select the next sensing action based on a landmark heuristic, adapted from classical planning.	Semantic Scholar
We discuss landmarks for plan trees, providing several alternative definitions and discussing their merits.	Semantic Scholar
The key part of our planner is the novel landmarks-based heuristic, together with a projection method that uses classical planning to solve the intermediate conformant planning problems.	Semantic Scholar
The resulting heuristic contingent planner solves many more problems than state-of-the-art, translation-based online contingent planners, and in most cases, much faster, up to 3 times faster on simple problems, and 200 times faster on non-simple domains.	Semantic Scholar
In robotic mapping and simultaneous localization and mapping, the ability to assess the quality of estimated maps is crucial.	Semantic Scholar
While concepts exist for quantifying the error in the estimated trajectory of a robot, or a subset of the estimated feature locations, the difference between all current estimated and ground-truth features is rarely considered jointly.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to many current methods, this paper analyzes metrics, which automatically evaluate maps based on their joint detection and description uncertainty.	Semantic Scholar
In the tracking literature, the optimal subpattern assignment (OSPA) metric provided a solution to the problem of assessing target tracking algorithms and has recently been applied to the assessment of robotic maps.	Semantic Scholar
Despite its advantages over other metrics, the OSPA metric can saturate to a limiting value irrespective of the cardinality errors and it penalizes missed detections and false alarms in an unequal manner.	Semantic Scholar
This paper therefore introduces the cardinalized optimal linear assignment (COLA) metric, as a complement to the OSPA metric, for feature map evaluation.	Semantic Scholar
Their combination is shown to provide a robust solution for the evaluation of map estimation errors in an intuitive manner.	Semantic Scholar

The problem of global dissipativity for memristor-based inertial networks with time-varying delay of neutral type is investigated in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
Based on a proper variable substitution, the inertial system is transformed into a conventional system.	Semantic Scholar
Some sufficient criteria are established to ascertain the global dissipativity for the aforementioned inertial neural networks by employing analytical techniques and Lyapunov method.	Semantic Scholar
Meanwhile, the globally exponentially attractive sets and positive invariant sets are also presented here.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, numerical examples and simulations are given out to corroborate the effectiveness of obtained results.	Semantic Scholar
Robust object manipulation using a robotic hand remains a challenging task, especially when a priori knowledge of the object being manipulated is not available.	Semantic Scholar
Tactile-based blind grasping is hereby defined where only typical sensors on-board the robotic hand unit are available.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a robust discrete-time controller for tactile-based blind grasping to manipulate unknown objects.	Semantic Scholar
The analysis contained herein shows that from an initial stable pose, tactile feedback in the form of contact location and joint measurements are sufficient information to perform object manipulation, and ensure that the object does not slip.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the analysis guarantees semiglobal practical asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system and takes into consideration the effect of sampling time.	Semantic Scholar
The robustness of the proposed control is demonstrated through simulation and experiments.	Semantic Scholar
Memory models based on synapses with discrete and bounded strengths store new memories by forgetting old ones.	Semantic Scholar
Memory lifetimes in such memory systems may be defined in a variety of ways.	Semantic Scholar
A mean first passage time (MFPT) definition overcomes much of the arbitrariness and many of the problems associated with the more usual signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) definition.	Semantic Scholar
We have previously computed MFPT lifetimes for simple, binary-strength synapses that lack internal, plasticity-related states.	Semantic Scholar
In simulation we have also seen that for multistate synapses, optimality conditions based on SNR lifetimes are absent with MFPT lifetimes, suggesting that such conditions may be artifactual.	Semantic Scholar
Here we extend our earlier work by computing the entire first passage time (FPT) distribution for simple, multistate synapses, from which all statistics, including the MFPT lifetime, may be extracted.	Semantic Scholar
For this, we develop a Fokker-Planck equation using the jump moments for perceptron activation.	Semantic Scholar
Two models are considered that satisfy a particular eigenvector condition that this approach requires.	Semantic Scholar
In these models, MFPT lifetimes do not exhibit optimality conditions, while in one but not the other, SNR lifetimes do exhibit optimality.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, not only are such optimality conditions artifacts of the SNR approach, but they are also strongly model dependent.	Semantic Scholar
By examining the variance in the FPT distribution, we may identify regions in which memory storage is subject to high variability, although MFPT lifetimes are nevertheless robustly positive.	Semantic Scholar
In such regions, SNR lifetimes are typically (defined to be) zero.	Semantic Scholar
FPT-defined memory lifetimes therefore provide an analytically superior approach and also have the virtue of being directly related to a neuron's firing properties.	Semantic Scholar
We present a novel computational approach to design the robotic devices from high-level motion specifications.	Semantic Scholar
Our computational system uses a library of modular components—actuators, mounting brackets, and connectors—to define the space of possible robot designs.	Semantic Scholar
The process of creating a new robot begins with a set of input trajectories that specify how its end effectors and/or body should move.	Semantic Scholar
By searching through the combinatorial set of possible arrangements of modular components, our method generates a functional, as-simple-as-possible robotic device that is capable of tracking the input motion trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
To significantly improve the efficiency of this discrete optimization process, we propose a novel heuristic that guides the search for appropriate designs.	Semantic Scholar
Briefly, our heuristic function estimates how much an intermediate robot design needs to change before it becomes able to execute the target motion trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our computational design method by automatically creating a variety of robotic manipulators and legged robots.	Semantic Scholar
To generate these results, we define our own robotic kit that includes off-the-shelf actuators and 3-D printable connectors.	Semantic Scholar
We validate our results by fabricating two robotic devices designed with our method.	Semantic Scholar

This paper proposes a new unsupervised spectral feature selection method to preserve both the local and global structure of the features as well as the samples.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, our method uses the self-expressiveness of the features to represent each feature by other features for preserving the local structure of features, and a low-rank constraint on the weight matrix to preserve the global structure among samples as well as features.	Semantic Scholar
Our method also proposes to learn the graph matrix measuring the similarity of samples for preserving the local structure among samples.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we propose a new optimization algorithm to the resulting objective function, which iteratively updates the graph matrix and the intrinsic space so that collaboratively improving each of them.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental analysis on 12 benchmark datasets showed that the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art feature selection methods in terms of classification performance.	Semantic Scholar

After many years of successful development of new approaches for software verification, there is a need to consolidate the knowledge about the different abstract domains and algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
The goal of this paper is to provide a compact and accessible presentation of four SMT-based verification approaches in order to study them in theory and in practice.	Semantic Scholar
We present and compare the following different “schools of thought” of software verification: bounded model checking, k-induction, predicate abstraction, and lazy abstraction with interpolants.	Semantic Scholar
Those approaches are well-known and successful in software verification and have in common that they are based on SMT solving as the back-end technology.	Semantic Scholar
We reformulate all four approaches in the unifying theoretical framework of configurable program analysis and implement them in the verification framework CPAchecker.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this, we can present an evaluation that thoroughly compares the different approaches, where the core differences are expressed in configuration parameters and all other variables are kept constant (such as parser front end, SMT solver, used theory in SMT formulas).	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the approaches on a large set of verification tasks and discuss the conclusions.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we shed light on two fundamental actuation capabilities of multirotors.	Semantic Scholar
The first is the degree of coupling between the total force and total moment generated by the propellers.	Semantic Scholar
The second is the ability to robustly fly completely still in place after the loss of one or more propellers, in the case of mono-directional propellers.	Semantic Scholar
These are formalized through the definition of some algebraic conditions on the control allocation matrices.	Semantic Scholar
The theory is valid for any multirotor, with arbitrary number, position, and orientation of the propellers.	Semantic Scholar
As a show case for the general theory, we demonstrate that standard star-shaped hexarotors with collinear propellers are not able to robustly fly completely still at a constant spot using only five of their six propellers.	Semantic Scholar
To deeply understand this counterintuitive result, it is enough to apply our theory, which clarifies the role of the tilt angles and locations of the propellers.	Semantic Scholar
The theory is also able to explain why, on the contrary, both the tilted star-shaped and the Y-shaped hexarotors can fly with only five out of six propellers.	Semantic Scholar
The analysis is validated with both simulations and extensive experimental results showing recovery control after rotor losses.	Semantic Scholar

Simultaneous localization and planning (SLAP) is a crucial ability for an autonomous robot operating under uncertainty.	Semantic Scholar
In its most general form, SLAP induces a continuous partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which needs to be repeatedly solved online.	Semantic Scholar
This paper addresses this problem and proposes a dynamic replanning scheme in belief space.	Semantic Scholar
The underlying POMDP, which is continuous in state, action, and observation space, is approximated offline via sampling-based methods, but operates in a replanning loop online to admit local improvements to the coarse offline policy.	Semantic Scholar
This construct enables the proposed method to combat changing environments and large localization errors, even when the change alters the homotopy class of the optimal trajectory.	Semantic Scholar
It further outperforms the state-of-the-art Feedback-based Information RoadMap (FIRM) method by eliminating unnecessary stabilization steps.	Semantic Scholar
Applying belief space planning to physical systems brings with it a plethora of challenges.	Semantic Scholar
A key focus of this paper is to implement the proposed planner on a physical robot and show the SLAP solution performance under uncertainty, in changing environments and in the presence of large disturbances, such as a kidnapped robot situation.	Semantic Scholar
In Parkinson's disease, the enhanced beta rhythm is closely associated with akinesia/bradykinesia and rigidity.	Semantic Scholar
An increase in beta oscillations (12-35 Hz) within the basal ganglia (BG) nuclei does not proliferate throughout the cortico-basal ganglia loop in uniform fashion; rather it can be subdivided into two distinct frequency bands, i.e.	Semantic Scholar
the lower beta (12-20 Hz) and upper beta (21-35 Hz).	Semantic Scholar
A computational model of the excitatory and inhibitory neural network that focuses on the population properties is proposed to explore the mechanism underlying the pathological beta oscillations.	Semantic Scholar
Simulation results show several findings.	Semantic Scholar
The upper beta frequency in the BG originates from a high frequency cortical beta, while the emergence of exaggerated lower beta frequency in the BG depends greatly on the enhanced excitation of a reciprocal network consisting of the globus pallidus externus (GPe) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN).	Semantic Scholar
There is also a transition mechanism between the upper and lower beta oscillatory activities, and we explore the impact of self-inhibition within the GPe on the relationship between the upper beta and lower beta oscillations.	Semantic Scholar
It is shown that increased self-inhibition within the GPe contributes to increased upper beta oscillations driven by the cortical rhythm, while decrease in the self-inhibition within the GPe facilitates an enhancement of the lower beta oscillations induced by the increased excitability of the BG.	Semantic Scholar
This work provides an analysis for understanding the mechanism underlying pathological synchronization in neurological diseases.	Semantic Scholar

In this study, a method is proposed that eliminates spiral waves in a locally connected chaotic neural network (CNN) under some simplified conditions, using a dynamic phase space constraint (DPSC) as a control method.	Semantic Scholar
In this method, a control signal is constructed from the feedback internal states of the neurons to detect phase singularities based on their amplitude reduction, before modulating a threshold value to truncate the refractory internal states of the neurons and terminate the spirals.	Semantic Scholar
Simulations showed that with appropriate parameter settings, the network was directed from a spiral wave state into either a plane wave (PW) state or a synchronized oscillation (SO) state, where the control vanished automatically and left the original CNN model unaltered.	Semantic Scholar
Each type of state had a characteristic oscillation frequency, where spiral wave states had the highest, and the intra-control dynamics was dominated by low-frequency components, thereby indicating slow adjustments to the state variables.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the PW-inducing and SO-inducing control processes were distinct, where the former generally had longer durations but smaller average proportions of affected neurons in the network.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, variations in the control parameter allowed partial selectivity of the control results, which were accompanied by modulation of the control processes.	Semantic Scholar
The results of this study broaden the applicability of DPSC to chaos control and they may also facilitate the utilization of locally connected CNNs in memory retrieval and the exploration of traveling wave dynamics in biological neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
While predictive planning approaches have had broad success in robot navigation, most implementations of them have important limitations.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, they plan around a single predicted outcome (plus uncertainty) or the union of several likely outcomes.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we introduce the multiworld motion planning problem, where a robot plans around each likely outcome separately, while maintaining a safe trajectory until it can determine which of the predictions actually happened.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce a method both for split detection (understanding when multiple plans can be created) and split planning (planning path over these separate contingencies).	Semantic Scholar
We apply our techniques to simulated robots with both holonomic and nonholonomic dynamics in a variety of scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
We show that our resulting approach can produce substantially safer and shorter trajectories than traditional motion planning in critical situations that commonly arise in tasks such as navigating in human environments.	Semantic Scholar
Researchers have developed variable-impedance mechanisms to control the dynamic response of robotic systems and improve their adaptivity, robustness, and efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
However, these mechanisms have limitations in size, cost, and convenience, particularly for variable damping.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate that laminar jamming structures can transform the dynamic response of robotic structures and systems while overcoming these limitations.	Semantic Scholar
In laminar jamming, an external pressure gradient is applied to a laminate of compliant material, changing its stiffness and damping.	Semantic Scholar
In this latter, we combine analysis, simulation, and characterization to formulate a lumped-parameter model that captures the nonlinear mechanical behavior of jamming structures and can be used to rapidly simulate their dynamic response.	Semantic Scholar
We illustrate that by adjusting the vacuum pressure, the fundamental features of the dynamic response (i.e., frequency, amplitude, decay rate, and steady-state value) can be tuned on command.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we demonstrate that jamming structures can be integrated into soft structures and traditional rigid robots to considerably alter their response to impacts.	Semantic Scholar
With the models and demonstrations provided here, researchers may move further toward building versatile and transformative robots.	Semantic Scholar
We have been developing a paradigm that we call learning-from-observation for a robot to automatically acquire a robot program to conduct a series of operations, or for a robot to understand what to do, through observing humans performing the same operations.	Semantic Scholar
Since a simple mimicking method to repeat exact joint angles or exact end-effector trajectories does not work well because of the kinematic and dynamic differences between a human and a robot, the proposed method employs intermediate symbolic representations, tasks, for conceptually representing what-to-do through observation.	Semantic Scholar
These tasks are subsequently mapped to appropriate robot operations depending on the robot hardware.	Semantic Scholar
In the present work, task models for upper-body operations of humanoid robots are presented, which are designed on the basis of Labanotation.	Semantic Scholar
Given a series of human operations, we first analyze the upper-body motions and extract certain fixed poses from key frames.	Semantic Scholar
These key poses are translated into tasks represented by Labanotation symbols.	Semantic Scholar
Then, a robot performs the operations corresponding to those task models.	Semantic Scholar
Because tasks based on Labanotation are independent of robot hardware, different robots can share the same observation module, and only different task-mapping modules specific to robot hardware are required.	Semantic Scholar
The system was implemented and demonstrated that three different robots can automatically mimic human upper-body operations with a satisfactory level of resemblance.	Semantic Scholar
Inspired by nature, soft robots promise disruptive advances in robotics.	Semantic Scholar
Soft robots are naturally compliant and exhibit nonlinear behavior, which makes their study challenging.	Semantic Scholar
No unified framework exists to control these robots, especially when considering their dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
This letter proposes a methodology to study this type of robots around a stable equilibrium point.	Semantic Scholar
It can make the robot converge faster and with reduced oscillations to a desired equilibrium state.	Semantic Scholar
Using computational mechanics, a large-scale dynamic model of the robot is obtained and model reduction algorithms enable the design of a low-order controller and observer.	Semantic Scholar
A real robot is used to demonstrate the interest of the results.	Semantic Scholar
For a robot to perform complex manipulation tasks, such as an in-hand manipulation, knowledge about the state of the grasp is required at all times.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, even simple pick-and-place tasks may fail because unexpected motions of the object during the grasp are not accounted for.	Semantic Scholar
This letter proposes an approach that estimates the grasp state by combining finger measurements, i.e., joint positions and torques, with visual features that are extracted from monocular camera images.	Semantic Scholar
The different sensor modalities are fused using an extended Kalman filter.	Semantic Scholar
While the finger measurements allow to detect contacts and resolve collisions between the fingers and the estimated object, the visual features are used to align the object with the camera view.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments with the DLR robot David demonstrate the wide range of objects and manipulation scenarios that the method can be applied to.	Semantic Scholar
They also provide an insight into the strengths and limitations of the different complementary types of measurements.	Semantic Scholar
It is well known that the support vector machine (SVM) is an effective learning algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm has emerged as a powerful technique for solving distributed optimisation models.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a distributed SVM algorithm in a master-slave mode (MS-DSVM), which integrates a distributed SVM and ADMM acting in a master-slave configuration where the master node and slave nodes are connected, meaning the results can be broadcasted.	Semantic Scholar
The distributed SVM is regarded as a regularised optimisation problem and modelled as a series of convex optimisation sub-problems that are solved by ADMM.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, the over-relaxation technique is utilised to accelerate the convergence rate of the proposed MS-DSVM.	Semantic Scholar
Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed MS-DSVM has linear convergence, meaning it possesses the fastest convergence rate among existing standard distributed ADMM algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical examples demonstrate that the convergence and accuracy of the proposed MS-DSVM are superior to those of existing methods under the ADMM framework.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a quantitative method for analyzing the effect of sensor resolution on grasp stability prediction.	Semantic Scholar
Resolution limits for contact sensors are expressed as a range of contact locations and contact surface normals that cannot be disambiguated by the sensor.	Semantic Scholar
Grasp quality is assessed at the limits of this range to determine whether the uncertainties caused by sensor resolution lead to uncertainty in grasp outcome prediction.	Semantic Scholar
The analysis also enables calculation of the specific contact locations on an object where the tactile sensors are trustworthy and where the object is reliably graspable.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach lays the foundation for quantitative evaluation in design tradeoffs in sensor choices and sensor layout, as well as finger shapes and materials.	Semantic Scholar
The traditional -means algorithm has been widely used as a simple and efficient clustering method.	Semantic Scholar
However, the performance of this algorithm is highly dependent on the selection of initial cluster centers.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, the method adopted for choosing initial cluster centers is extremely important.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we redefine the density of points according to the number of its neighbors, as well as the distance between points and their neighbors.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we define a new distance measure that considers both Euclidean distance and density.	Semantic Scholar
Based on that, we propose an algorithm for selecting initial cluster centers that can dynamically adjust the weighting parameter.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we propose a new internal clustering validation measure, the clustering validation index based on the neighbors (CVN), which can be exploited to select the optimal result among multiple clustering results.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing initialization methods on real-world data sets and demonstrates the adaptability of the proposed algorithm to data sets with various characteristics.	Semantic Scholar
The goal of this paper is to improve the performance of joint human–robot systems while balancing human experience through computational trust analysis in telerobotics applications.	Semantic Scholar
A mixed-initiative approach is enabled by scaling the manual and autonomous controls using a function of computational human-to-robot trust.	Semantic Scholar
A dynamic haptic force feedback scaling strategy is performed via a function of computational robot-to-human trust to adjust the assistive force and, hence, physical workload of the operator.	Semantic Scholar
Passivity-based methods are used to guarantee the stability of the overall framework.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, guidelines are provided to adjust the transparency of force feedback and velocity signals while guaranteeing passivity.	Semantic Scholar
An experimental study with 30 human subjects demonstrates a 12.8% increase in task performance and a 10.7% decrease in operator workload when the proposed strategy is used as compared to a manual autonomy allocation approach.	Semantic Scholar
The results also indicate that the proposed method yields higher operator satisfaction compared to manual and optimal autonomy allocation methods and is 10.1% more trusted by the operators than the optimal allocation method.	Semantic Scholar
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate how the inclusion of a tactical task goal awareness measure complemented mental workload and performance measures in a simulated air combat mission.	Semantic Scholar
It was hypothesized that the evaluation of the tactical task goal awareness could provide additional information concerning the cognitive demands a pilot is exposed to during a complex air combat task.	Semantic Scholar
A test setting was developed to test this hypothesis in a virtual flight training device.	Semantic Scholar
To highlight the impact of task complexity, high performance aircraft pilots’ heart rate (HR), interbeat-interval (IBI), and performance in two simple flying tasks were first compared.	Semantic Scholar
Then, a similar comparison, complemented with the tactical task goal awareness measure, was made with two complex flying tasks.	Semantic Scholar
It was found that when the pilot's awareness of the tactical goals was low, a combination of low performance and low mental workload occurred.	Semantic Scholar
It was concluded that when the pilots’ performance is evaluated on a complex air combat task, the awareness of the tactical goals, performance, and mental workload should be studied together as the pilot's awareness can explain some of HR/IBI responses that could be otherwise misinterpreted.	Semantic Scholar
More generally, mental workload, performance, and task goal awareness should all be considered when the operator's performance in any complex human–machine system is assessed.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the high levels of competition in a global market, companies have put more emphasis on building strong customer relationships and increasing customer satisfaction levels.	Semantic Scholar
With technological improvements in information and communication technologies, a highly anticipated key contributor to improve the customer experience and satisfaction in service episodes is through the application of video analytics, such as to evaluate the customer's emotions over the full service cycle.	Semantic Scholar
Currently, emotion recognition from video is a challenging research area.	Semantic Scholar
One of the most effective solutions to address this challenge is to utilize both the audio and visual components as two sources contained in the video data to make an overall assessment of the emotion.	Semantic Scholar
The combined use of audio and visual data sources presents additional challenges, such as determining the optimal data fusion technique prior to classification.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose an audio–visual emotion recognition system to detect the universal six emotions (happy, angry, sad, disgust, surprise, and fear) from video data.	Semantic Scholar
The detected customer emotions are then mapped and translated to give customer satisfaction scores.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed customer satisfaction video analytics system can operate over video conferencing or video chat.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness of our proposal is verified through numerical results.	Semantic Scholar
The last few years have seen a phenomenal surge in the interests and new developments in neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
For example, a review article on deep learning published by Schmidhuber (2015) in our journal has been cited more than 800 times according to Google Scholar.	Semantic Scholar
Neural Networks continues to support such exciting developments through high-quality peer reviewing, prompt publication, and wide circulation.	Semantic Scholar
This volume begins the thirtieth year of publication of Neural Networks, the world’s first journal dedicated to the interdisciplinary and vibrant field of neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
As the official journal of the International Neural Network Society (INNS), the European Neural Network Society (ENNS), and the Japanese Neural Network Society (JNNS), Neural Networks publishes the full range of research in neural networks, including modeling in cognitive science and neuroscience, learning systems, mathematical and computational analysis, and engineering and applications.	Semantic Scholar
The past year continued to an excellent year for our journal.	Semantic Scholar
First, we continued to receive a large number of submissions, reflecting the trust our authors place in Neural Networks.	Semantic Scholar
Second, thanks in part to themeasures implemented in recent years (Doya, Taylor, & Wang, 2012; Doya & Wang, 2014, 2015), the review and publication time has been further shortened.	Semantic Scholar
As documented on the journal website (http://journalinsights.elsevier.com/journals/ 0893-6080/review_speed), it now takes on average 7.7 weeks to reach the first decision after submission, and 11.8 weeks to reach the final decision.	Semantic Scholar
Even compared to the already good review speed in 2015 (Doya & Wang, 2016), this represents a reduction of more than one week in each of these two metrics.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the impact factor has increased considerably in themost recent year, to 3.216.	Semantic Scholar
We are pleased to announce the introduction of the Best Paper Award to recognize annually a single outstanding paper published in Neural Networks, with a prize of $1000.	Semantic Scholar
The first round of competitionwill take place this year and the awardwill be selected from the papers published in 2015.	Semantic Scholar
More details about the Best Paper Award are posted on the journal website.	Semantic Scholar
There are four types of submissions to Neural Networks:	Semantic Scholar
Telemanipulated robot-assisted surgical procedures of the retina require precise manipulation of instruments inserted through trocars in the sclera.	Semantic Scholar
However, there is not a unique mapping of the motions of the surgeon's hand to the lower-dimensional motions of the instrument through the trocar, and it is not obvious what method would be best.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we study operator performance during a precision positioning task reminiscent of telemanipulated retinal surgery on a force-sensing phantom retina with three viable and previously considered options for the hapticinterface kinematics.	Semantic Scholar
The haptic-interface kinematics are implemented virtually, in software, on a PHANTOM Premium 6DOF haptic interface.	Semantic Scholar
Results from a study with 12 novice human subjects show that overall performance is best with the kinematics that represent a compact and inexpensive option, and that subjects' subjective preference agrees with the objective performance results.	Semantic Scholar
unknown	Semantic Scholar
It has been debated whether kinematic features, such as the number of peaks or decomposed submovements in a velocity profile, indicate the number of discrete motor impulses or result from a continuous control process.	Semantic Scholar
The debate is particularly relevant for tasks involving target perturbation, which can alter movement kinematics.	Semantic Scholar
To simulate such tasks, finite-horizon models require two preset movement durations to compute two control policies before and after the perturbation.	Semantic Scholar
Another model employs infinite- and finite-horizon formulations to determine, respectively, movement durations and control policies, which are updated every time step.	Semantic Scholar
We adopted an infinite-horizon optimal feedback control model that, unlike previous approaches, does not preset movement durations or use multiple control policies.	Semantic Scholar
It contains both control-dependent and independent noises in system dynamics, state-dependent and independent noises in sensory feedbacks, and different delays and noise levels for visual and proprioceptive feedbacks.	Semantic Scholar
We analytically derived an optimal solution that can be applied continuously to move an effector toward a target regardless of whether, when, or where the target jumps.	Semantic Scholar
This single policy produces different numbers of peaks and “submovements” in velocity profiles for different conditions and trials.	Semantic Scholar
Movements that are slower or perturbed later appear to have more submovements.	Semantic Scholar
The model is also consistent with the observation that subjects can perform the perturbation task even without detecting the target jump or seeing their hands during reaching.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, because the model incorporates Weber's law via a state representation relative to the target, it explains why initial and terminal visual feedback are, respectively, less and more effective in improving end-point accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
Our work suggests that the number of peaks or submovements in a velocity profile does not necessarily reflect the number of motor impulses and that the difference between initial and terminal feedback does not necessarily imply a transition between open- and closed-loop strategies.	Semantic Scholar
A hybrid hand exoskeleton, leveraging rigid and soft elements, has been designed to serve as an assistive device to return the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL) and improve quality of life for a broad population with hand impairment.	Semantic Scholar
This glove-like exoskeleton, the SeptaPose Assistive and Rehabilitative (SPAR) Glove, is underactuated, enabling seven hand poses which support most ADLs.	Semantic Scholar
The device resides on the spectrum between traditional rigid devices and the latest soft robotic designs.	Semantic Scholar
It includes novel ergonomic elements for power transmission and additional features to enable self-donning and doffing.	Semantic Scholar
Embedded sensors enable pose estimation and intent detection for intuitive control of the glove.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we summarize the overall design of the glove, and present details of the novel rigid palm bar and hyperextension prevention elements.	Semantic Scholar
We characterize the grasp force and range of motion (ROM) of the glove, and present initial feedback from an end user.	Semantic Scholar
The SPAR Glove meets or exceeds the functional requirements of ADLs for both ROM and grasp force.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, the glove exceeds the grasp force capabilities of comparable devices, while simultaneously offering the highest number of poses.	Semantic Scholar
In addition to its role as an assistive device, the SPAR Glove exoskeleton has the potential to provide “hands-in” rehabilitation, centered on performing functional tasks.	Semantic Scholar
In the near term, the glove is a highly capable prototype for exploring hybrid assistive device design, intent detection, and user interface research.	Semantic Scholar
Thanks to the efforts of the robotics and autonomous systems community, the myriad applications and capacities of robots are ever increasing.	Semantic Scholar
There is increasing demand from end users for autonomous service robots that can operate in real environments for extended periods.	Semantic Scholar
In the Spatiotemporal Representations and Activities for Cognitive Control in Long-Term Scenarios (STRANDS) project (http://strandsproject.eu), we are tackling this demand head-on by integrating state-of-the-art artificial intelligence and robotics research into mobile service robots and deploying these systems for long-term installations in security and care environments.	Semantic Scholar
Our robots have been operational for a combined duration of 104 days over four deployments, autonomously performing end-user-defined tasks and traversing 116 km in the process.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we describe the approach we used to enable long-term autonomous operation in everyday environments and how our robots are able to use their long run times to improve their own performance.	Semantic Scholar
The Boolean Pythagorean Triples problem asks: does there exist a binary coloring of the natural numbers such that every Pythagorean triple contains an element of each color?	Semantic Scholar
This problem was first solved in 2016, when Heule, Kullmann and Marek encoded a finite restriction of this problem as a propositional formula and showed its unsatisfiability.	Semantic Scholar
In this work we formalize their development in the theorem prover Coq.	Semantic Scholar
We state the Boolean Pythagorean Triples problem in Coq, define its encoding as a propositional formula and establish the relation between solutions to the problem and satisfying assignments to the formula.	Semantic Scholar
We verify Heule et al.’s proof by showing that the symmetry breaks they introduced to simplify the propositional formula are sound, and by implementing a correct-by-construction checker for proofs of unsatisfiability based on reverse unit propagation.	Semantic Scholar
The finding that very large networks can be trained efficiently and reliably has led to a paradigm shift in computer vision from engineered solutions to learning formulations.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, the research challenge shifts from devising algorithms to creating suitable and abundant training data for supervised learning.	Semantic Scholar
How to efficiently create such training data?	Semantic Scholar
The dominant data acquisition method in visual recognition is based on web data and manual annotation.	Semantic Scholar
Yet, for many computer vision problems, such as stereo or optical flow estimation, this approach is not feasible because humans cannot manually enter a pixel-accurate flow field.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we promote the use of synthetically generated data for the purpose of training deep networks on such tasks.	Semantic Scholar
We suggest multiple ways to generate such data and evaluate the influence of dataset properties on the performance and generalization properties of the resulting networks.	Semantic Scholar
We also demonstrate the benefit of learning schedules that use different types of data at selected stages of the training process.	Semantic Scholar
Inspired by the recent development of deep network-based methods in semantic image segmentation, we introduce an end-to-end trainable model for face mask extraction in video sequence.	Semantic Scholar
Comparing to landmark-based sparse face shape representation, our method can produce the segmentation masks of individual facial components, which can better reflect their detailed shape variations.	Semantic Scholar
By integrating convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) algorithm with fully convolutional networks (FCN), our new ConvLSTM-FCN model works on a per-sequence basis and takes advantage of the temporal correlation in video clips.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we also propose a novel loss function, called segmentation loss, to directly optimise the intersection over union (IoU) performances.	Semantic Scholar
In practice, to further increase segmentation accuracy, one primary model and two additional models were trained to focus on the face, eyes, and mouth regions, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
Our experiment shows the proposed method has achieved a 16.99% relative improvement (from 54.50 to 63.76% mean IoU) over the baseline FCN model on the 300 Videos in the Wild (300VW) dataset.	Semantic Scholar
When modeling goal-directed behavior in the presence of various sources of uncertainty, planning can be described as an inference process.	Semantic Scholar
A solution to the problem of planning as inference was previously proposed in the active inference framework in the form of an approximate inference scheme based on variational free energy.	Semantic Scholar
However, this approximate scheme was based on the mean-field approximation, which assumes statistical independence of hidden variables and is known to show overconfidence and may converge to local minima of the free energy.	Semantic Scholar
To better capture the spatiotemporal properties of an environment, we reformulated the approximate inference process using the so-called Bethe approximation.	Semantic Scholar
Importantly, the Bethe approximation allows for representation of pairwise statistical dependencies.	Semantic Scholar
Under these assumptions, the minimizer of the variational free energy corresponds to the belief propagation algorithm, commonly used in machine learning.	Semantic Scholar
To illustrate the differences between the mean-field approximation and the Bethe approximation, we have simulated agent behavior in a simple goal-reaching task with different types of uncertainties.	Semantic Scholar
Overall, the Bethe agent achieves higher success rates in reaching goal states.	Semantic Scholar
We relate the better performance of the Bethe agent to more accurate predictions about the consequences of its own actions.	Semantic Scholar
Consequently, active inference based on the Bethe approximation extends the application range of active inference to more complex behavioral tasks.	Semantic Scholar
This article summarizes our efforts around the formally verified static analysis of iptables rulesets using Isabelle/HOL.	Semantic Scholar
We build our work around a formal semantics of the behavior of iptables firewalls.	Semantic Scholar
This semantics is tailored to the specifics of the filter table and supports arbitrary match expressions, even new ones that may be added in the future.	Semantic Scholar
Around that, we organize a set of simplification procedures and their correctness proofs: we include procedures that can unfold calls to user-defined chains, simplify match expressions, and construct approximations removing unknown or unwanted match expressions.	Semantic Scholar
For analysis purposes, we describe a simplified model of firewalls that only supports a single list of rules with limited expressiveness.	Semantic Scholar
We provide and verify procedures that translate from the complex iptables language into this simple model.	Semantic Scholar
Based on that, we implement the verified generation of IP space partitions and minimal service matrices.	Semantic Scholar
An evaluation of our work on a large set of real-world firewall rulesets shows that our framework provides interesting results in many situations, and can both help and out-compete other static analysis frameworks found in related work.	Semantic Scholar
unknown	Semantic Scholar
Affect presentation is periodic and multi-modal, such as through facial movements, body gestures, and so on.	Semantic Scholar
Studies have shown that temporal selection and multi-modal combinations may benefit affect recognition.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we therefore propose a spatio-temporal fusion model that extracts spatio-temporal hierarchical features based on select expressive components.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, a multi-modal hierarchical fusion strategy is presented.	Semantic Scholar
Our model learns the spatio-temporal hierarchical features from videos by a proposed deep network, which combines a convolutional neural networks (CNN), bilateral long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (BLSTM-RNN) with principal component analysis (PCA).	Semantic Scholar
"Our approach handles each video as a ""video sentence."""	Semantic Scholar
It first obtains a skeleton with the temporal selection process and then segments key words with a certain sliding window.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, it obtains the features with a deep network comprised of a video-skeleton and video-words.	Semantic Scholar
Our model combines the feature level and decision level fusion for fusing the multi-modal information.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results showed that our model improved the multi-modal affect recognition accuracy rate from 95.13% in existing literature to 99.57% on a face and body (FABO) database, our results have been increased by 4.44%, and it obtained a macro average accuracy (MAA) up to 99.71%.	Semantic Scholar
Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has been applied with great success on a wide range of applications.	Semantic Scholar
As NMF is increasingly applied to massive datasets such as web-scale dyadic data, it is desirable to leverage a cluster of machines to store those datasets and to speed up the factorization process.	Semantic Scholar
However, it is challenging to efficiently implement NMF in a distributed environment.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we show that by leveraging a new form of update functions, we can perform local aggregation and fully explore parallelism.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, the new form is much more efficient than the traditional form in distributed implementations.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, under the new form of update functions, we can perform frequent updates and lazy updates, which aim to use the most recently updated data whenever possible and avoid unnecessary computations.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, frequent updates and lazy updates are more efficient than their traditional concurrent counterparts.	Semantic Scholar
Through a series of experiments on a local cluster as well as the Amazon EC2 cloud, we demonstrate that our implementations with frequent updates or lazy updates are up to two orders of magnitude faster than the existing implementation with the traditional form of update functions.	Semantic Scholar
A typical robot assembly operation involves contacts with the parts of the product to be assembled and consequently requires the knowledge of not only position and orientation trajectories but also the accompanying force-torque profiles for successful performance.	Semantic Scholar
To learn the execution of assembly operations even when the geometry of the product varies across task executions, the robot needs to be able to adapt its motion based on a parametric description of the current task condition, which is usually provided by geometrical properties of the parts involved in the assembly.	Semantic Scholar
In our previous work we showedhowpositional control policies can be generalized to different task conditions.	Semantic Scholar
In this paperwe propose a complete methodology to generalize also the orientational trajectories and the accompanying force-torque profiles to compute the necessary control policy for a given condition of the assembly task.	Semantic Scholar
Our method is based on statistical generalization of successfully recorded executions at different task conditions, which are acquired by kinesthetic guiding.	Semantic Scholar
The parameters that describe the varying task conditions define queries into the recorded training data.	Semantic Scholar
To improve the execution of the skill after generalization, we combine the proposed approach with an adaptation method, thus enabling the refinement of the generalized assembly operation.	Semantic Scholar

In this paper, we tackle a challenging problem inherent in a series of applications: tracking the influential nodes in dynamic networks.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we model a dynamic network as a stream of edge weight updates.	Semantic Scholar
This general model embraces many practical scenarios as special cases, such as edge and node insertions, deletions as well as evolving weighted graphs.	Semantic Scholar
"Under the popularly adopted linear threshold model and independent cascade model, we consider two essential versions of the problem: finding the nodes whose influences passing a user specified threshold and finding the top-<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""yang-ieq1-2734667.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> most influential nodes."	Semantic Scholar
Our key idea is to use the polling-based methods and maintain a sample of random RR sets so that we can approximate the influence of nodes with provable quality guarantees.	Semantic Scholar
We develop an efficient algorithm that incrementally updates the sample random RR sets against network changes.	Semantic Scholar
We also design methods to determine the proper sample sizes for the two versions of the problem so that we can provide strong quality guarantees and, at the same time, be efficient in both space and time.	Semantic Scholar
In addition to the thorough theoretical results, our experimental results on five real network data sets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents the QAMDiagnos, a model of Quantum Associative Memory (QAM) that can be a helpful tool for medical staff without experience or laboratory facilities, for the diagnosis of four tropical diseases (malaria, typhoid fever, yellow fever and dengue) which have several similar signs and symptoms.	Semantic Scholar
The memory can distinguish a single infection from a polyinfection.	Semantic Scholar
Our model is a combination of the improved versions of the original linear quantum retrieving algorithm proposed by Ventura and the non-linear quantum search algorithm of Abrams and Lloyd.	Semantic Scholar
From the given simulation results, it appears that the efficiency of recognition is good when particular signs and symptoms of a disease are inserted given that the linear algorithm is the main algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The non-linear algorithm helps confirm or correct the diagnosis or give some advice to the medical staff for the treatment.	Semantic Scholar
So, our QAMDiagnos that has a friendly graphical user interface for desktop and smart-phone is a sensitive and a low-cost diagnostic tool that enables rapid and accurate diagnosis of four tropical diseases.	Semantic Scholar
Modern robotic systems with a large number of actuated degrees of freedom can be utilized to perform several tasks at the same time while following a given order of priority.	Semantic Scholar
The most frequently used method is to apply null space projections to realize such a strict hierarchy, where lower priority tasks are executed as long as they do not interfere with any higher priority objectives.	Semantic Scholar
However, introducing null space projectors inevitably destroys the beneficial and safety-relevant feature of passivity.	Semantic Scholar
Here, two controllers are proposed to restore the passivity: one with local energy tanks on each hierarchy level and one with a global tank for the entire system.	Semantic Scholar
The formal proofs of passivity show that no energy is generated by these controllers.	Semantic Scholar
Once the tanks are empty, passivity is still guaranteed at the cost of some control performance.	Semantic Scholar
Simulations and experiments on a torque-controlled robot validate the approaches and predestine them for the usage in safety-relevant applications.	Semantic Scholar
Reduction of end-to-end network delay is an optimization task with applications in multiple domains.	Semantic Scholar
Low delays enable improved information flow in social networks, quick spread of ideas in collaboration networks, low travel times for vehicles on road networks, and increased rate of packets in the case of communication networks.	Semantic Scholar
Delay reduction can be achieved by both improving the propagation capabilities of individual nodes and adding additional edges in the network.	Semantic Scholar
One of the main challenges in such network design problems is that the effects of local changes are not independent, and as a consequence, there is a combinatorial search-space of possible improvements.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, minimizing the cumulative propagation delay requires novel scalable and data-driven approaches.	Semantic Scholar
We consider the problem of network delay minimization via node upgrades.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the problem is NP-hard and prove strong inapproximability results about it (i.e., APX-hard) even for equal vertex delays.	Semantic Scholar
On the positive side, probabilistic approximations for a restricted version of the problem can be obtained.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a greedy heuristic to solve the general problem setting which has good quality in practice, but does not scale to very large instances.	Semantic Scholar
To enable scalability to real-world networks, we develop approximations for Greedy with probabilistic guarantees for every iteration, tailored to different models of delay distribution and network structures.	Semantic Scholar
Our methods scale almost linearly with the graph size and consistently outperform competitors in quality.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our approaches on several real-world graphs from different genres.	Semantic Scholar
We achieve up to two orders of magnitude speed-up compared to alternatives from the literature on moderate size networks, and obtain high-quality results in minutes on large datasets while competitors from the literature require more than four hours.	Semantic Scholar
"Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) is one of the successful approaches to resolving ""the plasticity-stability dilemma"" in neural networks, and its supervised learning model called ARTMAP is a powerful tool for classification."	Semantic Scholar
Among several improvements, such as Fuzzy or Gaussian based models, the state of art model is Bayesian based one, while solving the drawbacks of others.	Semantic Scholar
However, it is known that the Bayesian approach for the high dimensional and a large number of data requires high computational cost, and the covariance matrix in likelihood becomes unstable.	Semantic Scholar
This paper introduces Kernel Bayesian ART (KBA) and ARTMAP (KBAM) by integrating Kernel Bayes' Rule (KBR) and Correntropy Induced Metric (CIM) to Bayesian ART (BA) and ARTMAP (BAM), respectively, while maintaining the properties of BA and BAM.	Semantic Scholar
The kernel frameworks in KBA and KBAM are able to avoid the curse of dimensionality.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the covariance-free Bayesian computation by KBR provides the efficient and stable computational capability to KBA and KBAM.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, Correntropy-based similarity measurement allows improving the noise reduction ability even in the high dimensional space.	Semantic Scholar
The simulation experiments show that KBA performs an outstanding self-organizing capability than BA, and KBAM provides the superior classification ability than BAM, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
For autonomous driving, vehicle detection is the prerequisite for many tasks like collision avoidance and path planning.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a real-time three-dimensional (RT3D) vehicle detection method that utilizes pure LiDAR point cloud to predict the location, orientation, and size of vehicles.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to previous 3-D object detection methods, we used a pre-RoIpooling convolution technique that moves a majority of the convolution operations to ahead of the RoI pooling, leaving just a small part behind, so that significantly boosts the computation efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
We also propose a pose-sensitive feature map design which can be strongly activated by the relative poses of vehicles, leading to a high regression accuracy on the location, orientation, and size of vehicles.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on the KITTI benchmark dataset show that the RT3D is not only able to deliver competitive detection accuracy against state-of-the-art methods, but also the first LiDAR-based 3-D vehicle detection work that completes detection within 0.09 s which is even shorter than the scan period of mainstream LiDAR sensors.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose an asymptotically stable joint-space dynamical system (DS) that captures desired behaviors in joint-space while converging toward a task-space attractor in both position and orientation.	Semantic Scholar
To encode joint-space behaviors while meeting the stability criteria, we propose a DS constructed as a linear parameter varying system combining different behavior synergies and provide a method for learning these synergy matrices from demonstrations.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we use dimensionality reduction to find a low-dimensional embedding space for modulating joint synergies, and then estimate the parameters of the corresponding synergies by solving a convex semidefinite optimization problem that minimizes the joint velocity prediction error from the demonstrations.	Semantic Scholar
Our proposed approach is empirically validated on a variety of motions that reach a target in position and orientation, while following a desired joint-space behavior.	Semantic Scholar
Supervised learning approaches are widely used for driving style classification; however, they often require a large amount of labeled training data, which is usually scarce in a real-world setting.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, it is time-consuming to manually label huge amounts of driving data due to uncertainties of driver behavior and variances among the data analysts.	Semantic Scholar
To address this problem, a semisupervised approach, a semisupervised support vector machine (S3VM), is employed to classify drivers into aggressive and normal styles based on a few labeled data points.	Semantic Scholar
First, a few data clusters are selected and manually labeled using a $ k$ -means clustering method.	Semantic Scholar
Then, a specific differentiable surrogate of a loss function is developed, which makes it feasible to use standard optimization tools to solve the nonconvex optimization problem.	Semantic Scholar
One of the most popular quasi-Newton algorithms is then used to assign the optimal label to all of the training data.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we compare the S3VM method with a support vector machine method for classifying driving styles from different amounts of labeled data.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments show that the S3VM method can improve the classification accuracy by about 10% and reduce the labeling effort by using only a few labeled data clusters among huge amounts of unlabeled data.	Semantic Scholar
In minimally invasive surgery, surgeons’ tactile sense that contributes to intraoperative palpation and dexterous manipulation is strictly limited.	Semantic Scholar
We have previously developed a tactile sensor based on acoustic reflection for laparoscopic tumor detection.	Semantic Scholar
There was a major issue of the influence of ambient temperature change on the sensor output.	Semantic Scholar
In surgical situations, the temperature of the sensor changes from room temperature to body temperature because the sensor is inserted into the patient's body.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we propose a method of temperature compensation on the basis of frequency characteristics of the sensor.	Semantic Scholar
It is advantageous because of no need of any additional elements, such as a temperature sensor.	Semantic Scholar
We first investigated the influence of ambient temperature on the sensor output through theoretical analysis and an experiment.	Semantic Scholar
On the basis of the results, we developed the method of the compensation, and cross validation was conducted to assess its effectiveness.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, a validation test with a simulated laparoscopic setup, where a temperature gradient along the sensor prove was caused, was conducted.	Semantic Scholar
The results showed that the estimation error of the force applied to the sensing area was reduced by applying the proposed temperature compensation.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a wireless, wearable brain machine interface (BMI) system dedicated to signal sensing and processing for driver drowsiness detection (DDD).	Semantic Scholar
Owing to the importance of driver drowsiness and the possibility for brainwaves-based DDD, many electroencephalogram (EEG)-based approaches have been proposed.	Semantic Scholar
However, few studies focus on the early detection of driver drowsiness and on the early management of driver drowsiness using a closed-loop algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The reported wireless and wearable BMI system is used for 1) simultaneous EEG and gyroscope-based head movement measurement for the early detection of driver drowsiness and 2) simultaneous EEG and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for the early management of driver drowsiness.	Semantic Scholar
To achieve the purposes of easy-to-use and distraction-free driving, a Bluetooth low-energy module is embedded in this BMI system and used to communicate with a fully wearable consumer device, a smartwatch, which coordinates the work of drowsiness monitoring and brain stimulation with its embedded closed-loop algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed system offers a 128 Hz sampling rate per channel, 12-bit and 16-bit resolution for a single-channel EEG and a three-channel gyroscope, and a maximum 2 mA current for the tDCS.	Semantic Scholar
The current consumption of the whole headset system is 56 mA.	Semantic Scholar
The battery life of the smartwatch is 9 h. The DDD experimental results show that the proposed system obtained a 93.67% five-level overall accuracy, a 96.15% two-level (alert versus slightly drowsy) accuracy, and maximum 16- to 23-min wakefulness maintenance.	Semantic Scholar
This paper is concerned with the synchronization problem for an array of memristive neural networks with inertial term, linear coupling and time-varying delay.	Semantic Scholar
Since parameters in the connection weight matrices are state-dependent, that is to say, the connection weight matrices jump in certain intervals, the mathematical model of the coupled inertial memristive neural networks can be considered as an interval parametric uncertain system.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the interval parametric uncertainty theory, two different synchronization criteria for memristor-based neural networks are obtained by applying the p-matrix measure (p=1,2,∞,ω), Halanay inequality and constructing suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals.	Semantic Scholar
Two simulation examples with fully-connected and nearest neighboring topology are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the obtained theoretical results.	Semantic Scholar
The body structure of an anatomically correct tendon-driven musculoskeletal humanoid is complex, and the difference between its geometric model and the actual robot is very large because expressing the complex routes of tendon wires in a geometric model is very difficult.	Semantic Scholar
If we move a tendon-driven musculoskeletal humanoid by the tendon wire lengths of the geometric model, unintended muscle tension and slack will emerge.	Semantic Scholar
In some cases, this can lead to the wreckage of the actual robot.	Semantic Scholar
To solve this problem, we focused on reciprocal innervation in the human nervous system, and then implemented antagonist inhibition control (AIC)-based on the reflex.	Semantic Scholar
This control makes it possible to avoid unnecessary internal muscle tension and slack of tendon wires caused by model error, and to perform wide range motion safely for a long time.	Semantic Scholar
To verify its effectiveness, we applied AIC to the upper limb of the tendon-driven musculoskeletal humanoid, Kengoro, and succeeded in dangling for 14 min and doing pull-ups.	Semantic Scholar
Multi-class imbalanced problems have attracted growing attention from the real-world classification tasks in engineering.	Semantic Scholar
The underlying skewed distribution of multiple classes poses difficulties for learning algorithms, which becomes more challenging when considering overlapping between classes, lack of representative data, and mixed-type data.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we address this problem in a data-oriented way.	Semantic Scholar
Motivated by a recently proposed over-sampling technique designed for numeric data sets, Mahalanobis Distance-based Over-sampling (MDO), we use this technique to capture the covariance structure of the minority class and to generate synthetic samples along the probability contours for learning algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Based on MDO, we further improve the over-sampling strategy and generalize it for mixed-type data sets.	Semantic Scholar
The established technique, Adaptive Mahalanobis Distance-based Over-sampling (AMDO), introduces GSVD (Generalized Singular Value Decomposition) for mixed-type data, develops a partially balanced resampling scheme and optimizes the sample synthesis.	Semantic Scholar

Extensive experimental testing is performed on 15 multi-class imbalanced benchmarks and two data sets for precipitation phase recognition in comparison with several state-of-the-art multi-class imbalanced learning methods.	Semantic Scholar

For robots to become collaborative assistants, they need to be capable of naturally interacting with users in real environments.	Semantic Scholar
They also need to be able to learn new skills from non-expert users.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a novel parallel hidden Markov model (PaHMM) architecture for learning from demonstration (LfD), which allows a robot to learn a sequence of cooperative and non-cooperative behaviors from a single demonstration (single-shot) of a task-based human–robot interaction from two interacting teachers.	Semantic Scholar
During teaching, the robot learns both a human–robot interaction model and an object interaction model in order to be able to effectively determine its own behaviors.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments with a Baxter robot and several teachers were conducted to validate the ability of the robot to learn both cooperative and non-cooperative behaviors during a task-based interaction.	Semantic Scholar
Comparison experiments also show the robustness of our approach to spatial variations from the demonstrated behaviors and tracking errors when compared to other approaches.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a method to automate the exploration of unknown underwater structures for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs).	Semantic Scholar
The proposed algorithm iteratively incorporates exteroceptive sensor data and replans the next-best-view in order to fully map an underwater structure.	Semantic Scholar
This approach does not require prior environment information.	Semantic Scholar
However, a safe exploration depth and the exploration area (defined by a bounding box, parameterized by its size, location, and resolution) must be provided by the user.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm operates online by iteratively conducting the following three tasks: 1) Profiling sonar data are first incorporated into a 2-D grid map, where voxels are labeled according to their state (a voxel can be labeled as empty, unseen, occluded, occplane, occupied, or viewed).	Semantic Scholar
2) Useful viewpoints to continue exploration are generated according to the map.	Semantic Scholar
3) A safe path is generated to guide the robot toward the next viewpoint location.	Semantic Scholar
Two sensors are used in this approach: a scanning profiling sonar, which is used to build an occupancy map of the surroundings, and an optical camera, which acquires optical data of the scene.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, in order to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we provide real-world results using the Sparus II AUV.	Semantic Scholar
Soft robotics is an emerging bioinspired concept of actuation, with promising applications for robotic locomotion and manipulation.	Semantic Scholar
Focusing on actuation by pressurized embedded fluidic networks, existing works examine quasi-static locomotion by inviscid fluids.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents analytic formulation and closed-form solutions of an elastic actuator with pressurized fluidic networks, while accounting for the effects of solid inertia and elasticity, as well as fluid viscosity.	Semantic Scholar
This allows modeling the system's step response and frequency response as well as suggesting mode elimination and isolation techniques.	Semantic Scholar
The theoretical results describing the viscous–elastic–inertial dynamics of the actuator are illustrated by experiments.	Semantic Scholar
The approach presented in this paper may pave the way for the design and implementation of soft robotic legged locomotion that exploits dynamic effects.	Semantic Scholar
We have studied neuronal synchronisation in a random network of adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neurons.	Semantic Scholar
We study how spiking or bursting synchronous behaviour appears as a function of the coupling strength and the probability of connections, by constructing parameter spaces that identify these synchronous behaviours from measurements of the inter-spike interval and the calculation of the order parameter.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we verify the robustness of synchronisation by applying an external perturbation to each neuron.	Semantic Scholar
The simulations show that bursting synchronisation is more robust than spike synchronisation.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, the hybrid neuron models which combine the basic neuron models with impulsive effect(the state reset process) had been proposed, however, the preset value and the reset value of membrane potential were both fixed constants in the known models.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, the Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model with nonlinear reset process is presented where the preset value and the reset value of membrane potential are variable constants.	Semantic Scholar
We conduct a qualitative analysis in the vicinity of the equilibrium point or the limit cycle of the proposed system by using the theories of impulsive semi-dynamical systems.	Semantic Scholar
Firstly, the more detailed impulsive set and phase set are given, then using the fixed point of Poincaré map, the existences of order-1and order-k(k>=2) period solutions are investigated subsequently.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, numerical investigations including period-adding bifurcation, multiple attractors coexistence, switch-like behavior are presented to further describe the bifurcation and chaos phenomena.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the obtained results and possible applications of the proposed model are elaborated.	Semantic Scholar
Ride-sharing (RS) has great values in saving energy and alleviating traffic pressure.	Semantic Scholar
Existing studies can be improved for better efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we propose a new ride-sharing model, where each driver has a requirement that if the driver shares a ride with a rider, the shared route percentage (i.e., the ratio of the shared route's distance to the driver's total travel distance) exceeds an expectation rate of the driver, e.g., 0.8.	Semantic Scholar
We consider two variants of this problem.	Semantic Scholar
The first considers multiple drivers and multiple riders and aims to compute driver-rider pairs to maximize the overall shared route percentage (SRP).	Semantic Scholar
We model this problem as the maximum weighted bigraph matching problem, where the vertices are drivers and riders, edges are driver-rider pairs, and edge weights are driver-rider's SRP.	Semantic Scholar
However, it is rather expensive to compute the SRP values for large numbers of driver-rider pairs on road networks.	Semantic Scholar
To address this problem, we propose an efficient method to prune many unnecessary driver-rider pairs and avoid computing the SRP values for every pair.	Semantic Scholar
To improve the efficiency, we propose an approximate method with error bound guarantee.	Semantic Scholar
The basic idea is that we compute an upper bound and a lower bound for each driver-rider pair in constant time.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we estimate an upper bound and a lower bound of the graph matching.	Semantic Scholar
Next, we select some driver-rider pairs, compute their real shortest-route distance, and update the lower and upper bounds of the maximum graph matching.	Semantic Scholar
We repeat above steps until the ratio of the upper bound to the lower bound is not larger than a given approximate rate.	Semantic Scholar
"The second considers multiple drivers and a single rider and aims to find the top-<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""li-ieq1-2760880.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> drivers for the rider with the largest SRP."	Semantic Scholar
We first prune a large number of drivers that cannot meet the SRP requirements.	Semantic Scholar
"Then, we propose a best-first algorithm that progressively selects the drivers with high probability to be in the top-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""li-ieq2-2760880.gif""/></alternatives> </inline-formula> results and prunes the drivers that cannot be in the top-<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX""> $k$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""li-ieq3-2760880.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> results."

Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.	Semantic Scholar
Neurostimulation is a promising therapy for abating epileptic seizures.	Semantic Scholar
However, it is extremely difficult to identify optimal stimulation patterns experimentally.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, human recordings are used to develop a functional 24 neuron network statistical model of hippocampal connectivity and dynamics.	Semantic Scholar
Spontaneous seizure-like activity is induced in silico in this reconstructed neuronal network.	Semantic Scholar
The network is then used as a testbed to design and validate a wide range of neurostimulation patterns.	Semantic Scholar
Commonly used periodic trains were not able to permanently abate seizures at any frequency.	Semantic Scholar
A simulated annealing global optimization algorithm was then used to identify an optimal stimulation pattern, which successfully abated 92% of seizures.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, in a fully responsive, or closed-loop, neurostimulation paradigm, the optimal stimulation successfully prevented the network from entering the seizure state.	Semantic Scholar
We propose that the framework presented here for algorithmically identifying patient-specific neurostimulation patterns can greatly increase the efficacy of neurostimulation devices for seizures.	Semantic Scholar
We investigate the problem of sequential linear data prediction for real life big data applications.	Semantic Scholar
The second order algorithms, i.e., Newton-Raphson Methods, asymptotically achieve the performance of the “best” possible linear data predictor much faster compared to the first order algorithms, e.g., Online Gradient Descent.	Semantic Scholar
"However, implementation of these second order methods results in a computational complexity in the order of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$O(M^2)$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""civek-ieq1-2754380.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> for an <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$M$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""civek-ieq2-2754380.gif""/> </alternatives></inline-formula> dimensional feature vector, where the first order methods offer complexity in the order of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$O(M)$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""civek-ieq3-2754380.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula>."	Semantic Scholar
Because of this extremely high computational need, their usage in real life big data applications is prohibited.	Semantic Scholar
"To this end, in order to enjoy the outstanding performance of the second order methods, we introduce a highly efficient implementation where the computational complexity of these methods is reduced from <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$O(M^2)$ </tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""civek-ieq4-2754380.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$O(M)$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""civek-ieq5-2754380.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula>."	Semantic Scholar
The presented algorithm provides the well-known merits of the second order methods while offering a computational complexity similar to the first order methods.	Semantic Scholar
We do not rely on any statistical assumptions, hence, both regular and fast implementations achieve the same performance in terms of mean square error.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm on several sequential big datasets.	Semantic Scholar
We also illustrate the numerical stability of the presented algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The manufacturing process of OLED displays requires a high accuracy and a highly clean transport system because during the evaporation process, organic materials are inherently sensitive to contamination and uniform deposition of an organic layer is important.	Semantic Scholar
Roller-based transfer systems are not suitable for OLED evaporation processes because the roller-based system has a poor driving performance due to nonlinear factors such as friction and generates a large amount of dust.	Semantic Scholar
On the other hand, the magnetic levitation transport system has the advantage of not generating any dust, and it is possible to achieve high-precision control.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, a magnetic levitation transport system for the OLED evaporation process is introduced.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, experimental verification of the developed system under vacuum is addressed.	Semantic Scholar
"In terms of levitation control performance, the maximum fluctuation of the levitation airgap at a standstill is 15.3 <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mu$</tex-math></inline-formula>m<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$_{pp}$</tex-math></inline-formula>, and in low-speed and high-speed operation modes, it is 95.0 and 282.3 <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mu$</tex-math></inline-formula>m<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$_{pp}$</tex-math></inline-formula>, respectively."

Semantic Scholar
To achieve such a highly precise control, especially under vacuum, novel control algorithms such as intelligent section control are applied to minimize abrupt changes in the activation of electromagnets as the carrier moves, and command shaping algorithms are applied to prevent excitation of the resonance mode of the system while at a higher control bandwidth.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, to verify long-term reliability, a 12-hour continuous operation test is conducted.	Semantic Scholar
Nowadays, with the development of e-commerce, a growing number of customers choose to go shopping online.	Semantic Scholar
To find attractive products from online shopping marketplaces, the skyline query is a useful tool which offers more interesting and preferable choices for customers.	Semantic Scholar
The skyline query and its variants have been extensively investigated.	Semantic Scholar
However, to the best of our knowledge, they have not taken into account the requirements of customers in certain practical application scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, online shopping marketplaces usually hold some price promotion campaigns to attract customers and increase their purchase intention.	Semantic Scholar
Considering the requirements of customers in this practical application scenario, we are concerned about product selection under price promotion.	Semantic Scholar
We formulate a constrained optimal product combination (COPC) problem.	Semantic Scholar
It aims to find out the skyline product combinations which both meet a customer's willingness to pay and bring the maximum discount rate.	Semantic Scholar
The COPC problem is significant to offer powerful decision support for customers under price promotion, which is certified by a customer study.	Semantic Scholar
To process the COPC problem effectively, we first propose a two list exact (TLE) algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The COPC problem is proven to be NP-hard, and the TLE algorithm is not scalable because it needs to process an exponential number of product combinations.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, we design a lower bound approximate (LBA) algorithm that has a guarantee about the accuracy of the results and an incremental greedy (IG) algorithm that has good performance.	Semantic Scholar
The experiment results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Following the increasingly popular trend of social interaction analysis in egocentric vision, this manuscript presents a comprehensive study for automatic social pattern characterization of a wearable photo-camera user, by relying on the visual analysis of egocentric photo-streams.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed framework consists of three major steps.	Semantic Scholar
The first step is to detect social interactions of the user where the impact of several social signals on the task is explored.	Semantic Scholar
The detected social events are inspected in the second step for categorization into different social meetings.	Semantic Scholar
These two steps act at event-level where each potential social event is modeled as a multi-dimensional time-series, whose dimensions correspond to a set of relevant features for each task, and LSTM is employed to classify the time-series.	Semantic Scholar
The last step of the framework is to characterize social patterns, which is essentially to infer the diversity and frequency of the social relations of the user through discovery of recurrences of the same people across the whole set of social events of the user.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental evaluation over a dataset acquired by 9 users demonstrates promising results on the task of social pattern characterization from egocentric photo-streams.	Semantic Scholar
Fuzzy Petri nets (FPNs) are a vital modeling technique for the construction of knowledge-based systems, which have been commonly used in many fields, such as fault diagnosis, risk assessment, workflow management, and disassembly process planning.	Semantic Scholar
However, the conventional FPNs have been blamed for the following reasons: 1) the representation parameters in FPNs cannot precisely model experts' experience since it is difficult to manage the fuzziness and randomness of knowledge assessments simultaneously, and 2) the weight coefficients in the existing approximate reasoning algorithms are hardly enough to reflect the associated weights of reordered places.	Semantic Scholar
In response, we propose a new type of FPNs, called cloud reasoning Petri nets (CRPNs) based on the concept of interval clouds and the hybrid averaging operator.	Semantic Scholar
The cloud production rules in a knowledge-based system are modeled by CRPNs, where the truth degrees of places, the certainty factors of rules, and the thresholds of transitions are represented by interval clouds.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, a matrix operation-based reasoning algorithm is proposed to improve the efficiency of calculating final truth degrees, in which both local and ordered weight coefficients are taken into consideration.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, a practical example concerning a power system is provided to demonstrate the usefulness and advantages of the proposed CRPN model.	Semantic Scholar
Representation learning algorithms are designed to learn abstract features that characterize data.	Semantic Scholar
State representation learning (SRL) focuses on a particular kind of representation learning where learned features are in low dimension, evolve through time, and are influenced by actions of an agent.	Semantic Scholar
The representation is learned to capture the variation in the environment generated by the agent's actions; this kind of representation is particularly suitable for robotics and control scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the low dimension characteristic of the representation helps to overcome the curse of dimensionality, provides easier interpretation and utilization by humans and can help improve performance and speed in policy learning algorithms such as reinforcement learning.	Semantic Scholar
This survey aims at covering the state-of-the-art on state representation learning in the most recent years.	Semantic Scholar
It reviews different SRL methods that involve interaction with the environment, their implementations and their applications in robotics control tasks (simulated or real).	Semantic Scholar
In particular, it highlights how generic learning objectives are differently exploited in the reviewed algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, it discusses evaluation methods to assess the representation learned and summarizes current and future lines of research.	Semantic Scholar
Intracellular surgery suffers from a low success rate due to the lack of three-dimensional (3-D) position feedback of selected organelles.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we developed a novel robot-aided microscopy system and 3-D reconstruction algorithm to conduct intracellular surgery with 3-D information.	Semantic Scholar
A series of optical sections along the vertical direction was obtained by microscopy lens movement.	Semantic Scholar
A 3-D reconstruction model of the specimen was realized after several deconvolution, segmentation, and reconstruction processes.	Semantic Scholar
Simulations and experiments were performed to verify the accuracy of the proposed algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, 3-D reconstruction position feedback was applied to extract mitochondria via a robot-aided wide-field fluorescence system.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach facilitates intracellular surgeries, such as organelle biopsy and cell injection.	Semantic Scholar
A growing number of multi-view data arises naturally in many scenarios, including medical diagnosis, webpage classification, and multimedia analysis.	Semantic Scholar
A challenge in learning from multi-view data is that not all instances are fully represented in all views, resulting in missing view data.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we focus on feature-level completion for missing view of multi-view data.	Semantic Scholar
Aiming at capturing both semantic complementarity and identical distribution among different views, an Isomorphic Linear Correlation Analysis (ILCA) method is proposed to linearly map multi-view data to a feature-isomorphic subspace through learning a set of excellent isomorphic features, thereby unfolding the shared information from different views.	Semantic Scholar
Meanwhile, we assume that missing view obeys normal distribution.	Semantic Scholar
Then, the missing view data matrix can be modeled as a low-rank component plus a sparse contribution.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, to accomplish missing view completion, an Identical Distribution Pursuit Completion (IDPC) model based on the learned features is proposed, in which the identical distribution constraint of missing view to the other available one in the feature-isomorphic subspace is fully exploited.	Semantic Scholar
Comprehensive experiments on several multi-view datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework yields promising results.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present an approach to the problem of Robot Learning from Demonstration (RLfD) in a dynamic environment, i.e.	Semantic Scholar
an environment whose state changes throughout the course of performing a task.	Semantic Scholar
RLfD mostly has been successfully exploited only in non-varying environments to reduce the programming time and cost, e.g.	Semantic Scholar
fixed manufacturing workspaces.	Semantic Scholar
Non-conventional production lines necessitate Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) implying robots and humans must work in shared workspaces.	Semantic Scholar
In such conditions, the robot needs to avoid colliding with the objects that are moved by humans in the workspace.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, not only is the robot: (i) required to learn a task model from demonstrations; but also, (ii) must learn a control policy to avoid a stationary obstacle.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, (iii) it needs to build a control policy from demonstration to avoid moving obstacles.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we present an incremental approach to RLfD addressing all these three problems.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RLfD approach, by a series of pick-and-place experiments by an ABB YuMi robot.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results show that a person can work in a workspace shared with a robot where the robot successfully avoids colliding with him.	Semantic Scholar
We present a framework for object recognition using robotic skins with embedded arrays of tactile sensing elements.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach is based on theoretical foundations in compressed sensing and compressed learning.	Semantic Scholar
In our framework, tactile data is compressed during acquisition, potentially in-hardware, and we perform recognition directly on the compressed data.	Semantic Scholar
This dimensionality reduction allows for accurate recognition with a small number of training samples, reducing the time and computational effort needed to train the classifier.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, for tasks where the full-resolution tactile array signal is needed, it can be recovered efficiently from the compressed signal.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate our method using data generated from a tactile array simulator.	Semantic Scholar
We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in recognizing surface roughness using data from a physical system.	Semantic Scholar
Evaluation results show our approach achieves high recognition accuracy, even with a compression ratio of 64:1.	Semantic Scholar
Many feature extraction methods reduce the dimensionality of data based on the input graph matrix.	Semantic Scholar
The graph construction which reflects relationships among raw data points is crucial to the quality of resulting low-dimensional representations.	Semantic Scholar
To improve the quality of graph and make it more suitable for feature extraction tasks, we incorporate a new graph learning mechanism into feature extraction and add an interaction between the learned graph and the low-dimensional representations.	Semantic Scholar
Based on this learning mechanism, we propose a novel framework, termed as unsupervised single view feature extraction with structured graph (FESG), which learns both a transformation matrix and an ideal structured graph containing the clustering information.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we propose a novel way to extend FESG framework for multi-view learning tasks.	Semantic Scholar
The extension is named as unsupervised multiple views feature extraction with structured graph (MFESG), which learns an optimal weight for each view automatically without requiring an additional parameter.	Semantic Scholar
To show the effectiveness of the framework, we design two concrete formulations within FESG and MFESG, together with two efficient solving algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Promising experimental results on plenty of real-world datasets have validated the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a framework for automatically generating speech-based interfaces for controlling virtual and augmented reality (AR) applications on wearable devices.	Semantic Scholar
Starting from a set of natural language descriptions of application functionalities and a catalog of general-purpose icons, annotated with possible implied meanings, the framework creates both vocabulary and grammar for the speech recognizer, as well as a graphic interface for the target application, where icons are expected to be capable of evoking available commands.	Semantic Scholar
To minimize user's cognitive load during interaction, a semantics-based optimization mechanism was used to find the best mapping between icons and functionalities and to expand the set of valid commands.	Semantic Scholar
The framework was evaluated by using it with see-through glasses for AR-based maintenance and repair operations.	Semantic Scholar
A set of experimental tests were designed to objectively and subjectively assess first-time user experience of the automatically generated interface in relation to that of a fully personalized interface.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, intuitiveness of the automatically generated interface was studied by analyzing the results obtained through trained users on the same interface.	Semantic Scholar
Objective measurements (in terms of false positives, false negatives, task completion rate, and average number of attempts for activating functionalities) and subjective measurements (about system response accuracy, likeability, cognitive demand, annoyance, habitability, and speed) reveal that the results obtained by the first-time users and experienced users with the proposed framework's interface are very similar, and their performances are comparable with those of both the considered references.	Semantic Scholar
Robotic solutions to clothing assistance can significantly improve quality of life for the elderly and disabled.	Semantic Scholar
Real-time estimation of the human–cloth relationship is crucial for efficient learning of motor skills for robotic clothing assistance.	Semantic Scholar
The major challenge involved is cloth-state estimation due to inherent nonrigidity and occlusion.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we present a novel framework for real-time estimation of the cloth state using a low-cost depth sensor, making it suitable for a feasible social implementation.	Semantic Scholar
The framework relies on the hypothesis that clothing articles are constrained to a low-dimensional latent manifold during clothing tasks.	Semantic Scholar
We propose the use of manifold relevance determination (MRD) to learn an offline cloth model that can be used to perform informed cloth-state estimation in real time.	Semantic Scholar
The cloth model is trained using observations from a motion capture system and depth sensor.	Semantic Scholar
MRD provides a principled probabilistic framework for inferring the accurate motion-capture state when only the noisy depth sensor feature state is available in real time.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results demonstrate that our framework is capable of learning consistent task-specific latent features using few data samples and has the ability to generalize to unseen environmental settings.	Semantic Scholar
We further present several factors that affect the predictive performance of the learned cloth-state model.	Semantic Scholar
Motion planning for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) is challenging since surface vessels are nonlinear underactuated kinodynamic systems with often large inertia.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, ASV planners must identify long-term trajectories in order to avoid guiding the ASV into inevitable collision states.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, maritime vessels are required to follow COLlision REGulationS (COLREGS), which dictate collision avoidance patterns.	Semantic Scholar
Current state-of-the-art methods are based on model predictive control (MPC) and assume that other vessels move at constant velocities without the consideration of COLREGS.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose COLREG-RRT, an RRT-based planner capable of identifying long-term, COLREGS-compliant trajectories with a high navigation success rate.	Semantic Scholar
This is achieved by conducting joint forward simulations of both the ASV and the other vessels during RRT growth in order to anticipate future collisions.	Semantic Scholar
The COLREGS-compliance is enforced by constructing virtual obstacles that inhibit tree growth.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate COLREGS-compliance in single-ship encounters and compare against two state-of-the-art methods in multiship encounters with up to 20 other vessels.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments indicate that COLREG-RRT has a 32% higher success rate and is real-time capable in the most difficult environment tested.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, COLREG-RRT identifies longer trajectories, as compared to MPC.	Semantic Scholar
This property aids with collision avoidance with other ships.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we develop a distributed algorithm to localize a network of robots moving arbitrarily in a bounded region.	Semantic Scholar
In the case of such mobile networks, the main challenge is that the robots may not be able to find nearby robots to implement a distributed algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
We address this issue by providing an opportunistic algorithm that only implements a location update when there are nearby robots and does not update otherwise.	Semantic Scholar
We assume that each robot measures a noisy version of its motion and the distances to the nearby robots.	Semantic Scholar
To localize a network of mobile robots in $\mathbb {R}^m$, we provide a simple linear update, which is based on barycentric coordinates and is linear–convex.	Semantic Scholar
We abstract the corresponding localization algorithm as a linear time-varying system and show that it asymptotically converges to the true locations of the robots.	Semantic Scholar
We first focus on the noiseless case, in which the distance and motion vectors are known (measured) perfectly, and provide sufficient conditions on the convergence of the algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
We then evaluate the performance of the algorithm in the presence of noise and provide modifications to counter the undesirable effects of noise.	Semantic Scholar
We further show that our algorithm precisely tracks a mobile network as long as there is at least one known beacon (a node whose location is perfectly known).	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a dexterous soft robotic hand, BCL-13, with 4 fingers and 13 independently actuated joints capable of in-hand manipulation.	Semantic Scholar
The iconic dexterity is enabled by a novel soft robotic finger design with three degrees of freedom (DOFs), significantly improving over existing soft actuator dexterity and realizing human-finger-like workspace.	Semantic Scholar
The palm is also equipped with a dedicated rotational DOF to enable opposition of fingers.	Semantic Scholar
Investigations on human hand model reduction, in-hand manipulation principles, as well as the fabrication procedures of the soft robotic fingers and hand were presented in detail.	Semantic Scholar
Dedicated experiments using the fabricated prototypes were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed robotic anthropomorphic system via a series of workspace, grasping, and in-hand manipulation tasks.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed BCL-13 hand offers a promising design solution to a lightweight, dexterous, affordable, and highly anthropomorphic robotic hand design.	Semantic Scholar
Short text clustering is a challenging problem due to its sparseness of text representation.	Semantic Scholar
Here we propose a flexible Self-Taught Convolutional neural network framework for Short Text Clustering (dubbed STC2), which can flexibly and successfully incorporate more useful semantic features and learn non-biased deep text representation in an unsupervised manner.	Semantic Scholar
In our framework, the original raw text features are firstly embedded into compact binary codes by using one existing unsupervised dimensionality reduction method.	Semantic Scholar
Then, word embeddings are explored and fed into convolutional neural networks to learn deep feature representations, meanwhile the output units are used to fit the pre-trained binary codes in the training process.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we get the optimal clusters by employing K-means to cluster the learned representations.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework is effective, flexible and outperform several popular clustering methods when tested on three public short text datasets.	Semantic Scholar
Regarding the bilateral operation system, the precise force sensing system is necessary to reduce intervening impedance.	Semantic Scholar
The force sensing system needs to be unaffected by machine vibration during robot motion because it is difficult to improve force control gain sufficiently due to the noise.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, it is desirable to mount a force sensor as close as possible to the contact point to sense applied force directly.	Semantic Scholar
Many researchers have studied the microend effector equipped with fiber Bragg grating (FBG) based force sensors.	Semantic Scholar
These studies mainly focus on the aspect of the manipulators, and it is required to validate the benefits when combining the FBG-based force sensors into the bilateral control system and driving it.	Semantic Scholar
This letter proposes a bilateral micro-operation system equipped with a 4-DOF force/torque sensor using FBG sensors (4D-FBG): mounted near the tip of forceps.	Semantic Scholar
4D-FBG is designed with the following three points to achieve the bilateral micro-operation system: First, low force sensing delay; second, the force sensing is hardly affected by gripping force and temperature change—in case, a gripper is actuated by wire and a sensor mounted between the actuator and the gripper, the actuating force interferes with force sensing structurally in general; and third, the force sensing is hardly affected by machine vibration during robot motion.	Semantic Scholar
A bilateral micro-operation system equipped with 4D-FBG is set up and has been tested.	Semantic Scholar
The result shows 4D-FBG works well at the above three points, and significantly reduces intervening inertia compared to the conventional force sensing method using the universal force/torque sensor mounted at the base of the end-effector.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, it is confirmed that lower intervening inertia can reduce the contact force when driving the system.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a computationally efficient method of generating state-to-state trajectories for fully actuated multirotor vehicles.	Semantic Scholar
The approach consists of computing translational and rotational motion primitives that guide the vehicle from any initial state, defined by position, velocity, and attitude, to any end state in a given time, and subsequently verifying the motion primitives’ feasibility.	Semantic Scholar
Computationally lightweight motion primitives for which closed-form solutions exist are presented and an efficient method to test their feasibility is derived.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm is shown to be able to generate trajectories and verify their feasibility within a few microseconds and can thus be used as an implicit feedback law or in high-level path planners that involve evaluating a large number of possible trajectories to achieve some high-level goal.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm's performance is analyzed by comparing it with time-optimal trajectories.	Semantic Scholar
An experimental demonstration that requires the computation of trajectories for a large set of end states in real time is used to evaluate the approach.	Semantic Scholar
Recent successes in formally verifying increasingly larger computer-generated proofs have relied extensively on (a) using oracles, to find answers for recurring subproblems efficiently, and (b) extracting formally verified checkers, to perform exhaustive case analysis in feasible time.	Semantic Scholar
In this work we present a formal verification of optimality of sorting networks on up to 9 inputs, making it one of the largest computer-generated proofs that has been formally verified.	Semantic Scholar
We show that an adequate pre-processing of the information provided by the oracle is essential for feasibility, as it improves the time required by our extracted checker by several orders of magnitude.	Semantic Scholar
We consider the Watts-Strogatz small-world network (SWN) consisting of inhibitory fast spiking Izhikevich interneurons.	Semantic Scholar
This inhibitory neuronal population has adaptive dynamic synaptic strengths governed by the inhibitory spike-timing-dependent plasticity (iSTDP).	Semantic Scholar
In previous works without iSTDP, fast sparsely synchronized rhythms, associated with diverse cognitive functions, were found to appear in a range of large noise intensities for fixed strong synaptic inhibition strengths.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we investigate the effect of iSTDP on fast sparse synchronization (FSS) by varying the noise intensity D. We employ an asymmetric anti-Hebbian time window for the iSTDP update rule [which is in contrast to the Hebbian time window for the excitatory STDP (eSTDP)].	Semantic Scholar
Depending on values of D, population-averaged values of saturated synaptic inhibition strengths are potentiated [long-term potentiation (LTP)] or depressed [long-term depression (LTD)] in comparison with the initial mean value, and dispersions from the mean values of LTP/LTD are much increased when compared with the initial dispersion, independently of D. In most cases of LTD where the effect of mean LTD is dominant in comparison with the effect of dispersion, good synchronization (with higher spiking measure) is found to get better via LTD, while bad synchronization (with lower spiking measure) is found to get worse via LTP.	Semantic Scholar
This kind of Matthew effect in inhibitory synaptic plasticity is in contrast to that in excitatory synaptic plasticity where good (bad) synchronization gets better (worse) via LTP (LTD).	Semantic Scholar
Emergences of LTD and LTP of synaptic inhibition strengths are intensively investigated via a microscopic method based on the distributions of time delays between the pre- and the post-synaptic spike times.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we also investigate the effects of network architecture on FSS by changing the rewiring probability p of the SWN in the presence of iSTDP.	Semantic Scholar
Hand pose estimation has matured rapidly in recent years.	Semantic Scholar
The introduction of commodity depth sensors and a multitude of practical applications have spurred new advances.	Semantic Scholar
We provide an extensive analysis of the state-of-the-art, focusing on hand pose estimation from a single depth frame.	Semantic Scholar
To do so, we have implemented a considerable number of systems, and have released software and evaluation code.	Semantic Scholar
We summarize important conclusions here: (1) Coarse pose estimation appears viable for scenes with isolated hands.	Semantic Scholar
However, high precision pose estimation [required for immersive virtual reality and cluttered scenes (where hands may be interacting with nearby objects and surfaces) remain a challenge.	Semantic Scholar
To spur further progress we introduce a challenging new dataset with diverse, cluttered scenes.	Semantic Scholar
(2) Many methods evaluate themselves with disparate criteria, making comparisons difficult.	Semantic Scholar
We define a consistent evaluation criteria, rigorously motivated by human experiments.	Semantic Scholar
(3) We introduce a simple nearest-neighbor baseline that outperforms most existing systems.	Semantic Scholar
This implies that most systems do not generalize beyond their training sets.	Semantic Scholar
This also reinforces the under-appreciated point that training data is as important as the model itself.	Semantic Scholar
We conclude with directions for future progress.	Semantic Scholar
This paper is devoted to studying the fixed-time synchronization of memristor-based BAM neural networks (MBAMNNs) with discrete delay.	Semantic Scholar
Fixed-time synchronization means that synchronization can be achieved in a fixed time for any initial values of the considered systems.	Semantic Scholar
In the light of the double-layer structure of MBAMNNs, we design two similar feedback controllers.	Semantic Scholar
Based on Lyapunov stability theories, several criteria are established to guarantee that the drive and response MBAMNNs can realize synchronization in a fixed time.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, by changing the parameters of controllers, this fixed time can be adjusted to some desired value in advance, irrespective of the initial values of MBAMNNs.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical simulations are included to validate the derived results.	Semantic Scholar
Object retrieval and classification in point cloud data are challenged by noise, irregular sampling density, and occlusion.	Semantic Scholar
To address this issue, we propose a point pair descriptor that is robust to noise and occlusion and achieves high retrieval accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
We further show how the proposed descriptor can be used in a four-dimensional (4-D) convolutional neural network for the task of object classification.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel 4-D convolutional layer that is able to learn class-specific clusters in the descriptor histograms.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we provide experimental validation on three benchmark datasets, which confirms the superiority of the proposed approach.	Semantic Scholar

This letter addresses the various practical design issues of a continuous-time time-delayed control (TDC) and proposes a new controller to make the TDC more suitable and applicable for real-life systems.	Semantic Scholar
While TDC has been renowned for its robust performance and simplicity in form, it requires state-derivatives feedback which may not be available explicitly in practice; and multiple numerical differentiations of the noisy state data deteriorate performance by invoking measurement error.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, position-only time-delayed control (POTDC) has been proposed for a class of Euler–Lagrange systems which encompasses a large class of practical systems such as robotic manipulators and unmanned mobile robots.	Semantic Scholar
Contrary to the conventional TDC, the proposed POTDC eliminates explicit requirement of velocity and acceleration feedbacks and uses only position information of present and past instances to estimate the velocity and acceleration terms.	Semantic Scholar
It thus alleviates the measurement error arising from a numerical computation of state-derivatives.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, based on the Razumikhin theorem, continuous-time stability is rigorously analyzed with consideration of the time-delay element in POTDC, which indeed establishes a selection criterion for the sampling interval and provides the designer a range of sampling intervals for same choice of controller gains.	Semantic Scholar
This allows POTDC to be suitable for systems which specifically operate with high sampling intervals due to application requirement.	Semantic Scholar
Accordingly, experimental validations of POTDC are provided in comparison with TDC under various sampling intervals, using a wheeled mobile robot.	Semantic Scholar
A design optimization approach for exoskeletons on the basis of simulation of the exoskeleton and a human body model is proposed in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
The human-centered approach, addressing the problem of physical human-exoskeleton interactions, models and simulates the mechanics for the exoskeleton and the human body in concern.	Semantic Scholar
It allows designers to efficiently analyse and evaluate exoskeleton functions.	Semantic Scholar
A simulation platform is developed by integrating a musculoskeletal human body and an exoskeleton.	Semantic Scholar
An assistive exoskeleton for the symptom of brachial plexus injury is simulated and analyzed.	Semantic Scholar
Two types of passive exoskeletons with gravity-compensating capability are evaluated, and the optimal spring stiffnesses are obtained.	Semantic Scholar
The design analysis and optimization results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.	Semantic Scholar
The problem of object recognition in natural scenes has been recently successfully addressed with Deep Convolutional Neuronal Networks giving a significant break-through in recognition scores.	Semantic Scholar
The computational efficiency of Deep CNNs as a function of their depth, allows for their use in real-time applications.	Semantic Scholar
One of the key issues here is to reduce the number of windows selected from images to be submitted to a Deep CNN.	Semantic Scholar
This is usually solved by preliminary segmentation and selection of specific windows, having outstanding ”objectiveness” or other value of indicators of possible location of objects.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we propose a Deep CNN approach and the general framework for recognition of objects in a real-time scenario and in an egocentric perspective.	Semantic Scholar
Here the window of interest is built on the basis of visual attention map computed over gaze fixations measured by a glass-worn eye-tracker.	Semantic Scholar
The application of this setup is an interactive user-friendly environment for upper-limb amputees.	Semantic Scholar
Vision has to help the subject to control his worn neuro-prosthesis in case of a small amount of remaining muscles when the EMG control becomes unefficient.	Semantic Scholar
The recognition results on a specifically recorded corpus of 151 videos with simple geometrical objects show the mAP of 64,6% and the computational time at the generalization lower than a time of a visual fixation on the object-of-interest.	Semantic Scholar

Conventional methods of matrix completion are linear methods that are not effective in handling data of nonlinear structures.	Semantic Scholar
Recently a few researchers attempted to incorporate nonlinear techniques into matrix completion but there still exists considerable limitations.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a novel method called deep matrix factorization (DMF) is proposed for nonlinear matrix completion.	Semantic Scholar
Different from conventional matrix completion methods that are based on linear latent variable models, DMF is on the basis of a nonlinear latent variable model.	Semantic Scholar
DMF is formulated as a deep-structure neural network, in which the inputs are the low-dimensional unknown latent variables and the outputs are the partially observed variables.	Semantic Scholar
In DMF, the inputs and the parameters of the multilayer neural network are simultaneously optimized to minimize the reconstruction errors for the observed entries.	Semantic Scholar
Then the missing entries can be readily recovered by propagating the latent variables to the output layer.	Semantic Scholar
DMF is compared with state-of-the-art methods of linear and nonlinear matrix completion in the tasks of toy matrix completion, image inpainting and collaborative filtering.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results verify that DMF is able to provide higher matrix completion accuracy than existing methods do and DMF is applicable to large matrices.	Semantic Scholar
This letter proposes a navigation method for multirobots with heterogeneous abilities.	Semantic Scholar
In this method, a single leader navigates other robots that have different translational and rotational velocity and acceleration, sensing distance and angle while maintaining global connectivity.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, this method is decentralized in which the leader does not need real-time information on the whole swarm, and all followers use only locally available information to follow a target.	Semantic Scholar
Validity and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated by theoretical analysis, and in a simulation and an experiment with real robots.	Semantic Scholar
Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is increasingly becoming a vital method of reducing surgical trauma and significantly improving postoperative recovery.	Semantic Scholar
However, skillful handling of surgical instruments used in MIS, especially for laparoscopy, requires a long period of training and depends highly on the experience of surgeons.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a new robot-assisted surgical training system which is designed to improve the practical skills of surgeons through intrapractice feedback and demonstration from both human experts and reinforcement learning (RL) agents.	Semantic Scholar
This system utilizes proximal policy optimization to learn the control policy in simulation.	Semantic Scholar
Subsequently, a generative adversarial imitation learning agent is trained based on both expert demonstrations and learned policies in simulation.	Semantic Scholar
This agent then generates demonstration policies on the robot-assisted device for trainees and produces feedback scores during practice.	Semantic Scholar
To further acquire surgical tools coordinates and encourage self-oriented practice, a mask region-based convolution neural network is trained to perform the semantic segmentation of surgical tools and targets.	Semantic Scholar
To the best of our knowledge, this system is the first robot-assisted laparoscopy training system which utilizes actual surgical tools and leverages deep reinforcement learning to provide demonstration training from both human expert perspectives and RL criterion.	Semantic Scholar
Dynamic control of soft robotic manipulators is a challenging field still in its nascent stages.	Semantic Scholar
Modeling is still a major hurdle due to its high dimensional nonlinear dynamic properties.	Semantic Scholar
Even if accurate models of these high dimensional nonlinear systems are available, the computational burden of the models or sensory requirements poses problems for robust and stable control.	Semantic Scholar
This letter addresses these two problems by using a data-driven model that uses only mechanical feedback for stable control of the soft robotic manipulator.	Semantic Scholar
Using a learning-based open loop dynamic controller, we investigate the self-stabilizing behavior that can be obtained from the complex dynamics of a soft manipulator.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental findings illustrate the advantage of using open-loop dynamic controllers for accurate self-stabilizing control of soft robotic manipulators without any sensory feedback.	Semantic Scholar
Reliable and efficient visual place recognition is a major building block of modern SLAM systems.	Semantic Scholar
Leveraging on our prior work, in this letter, we present a Hamming distance embedding binary search tree (HBST) approach for binary descriptor matching and image retrieval.	Semantic Scholar
HBST allows for descriptor search and insertion in logarithmic time by exploiting particular properties of binary descriptors.	Semantic Scholar
We support the idea behind our search structure with a thorough analysis on the exploited descriptor properties and their effects on completeness and complexity of search and insertion.	Semantic Scholar
To validate our claims, we conducted comparative experiments for HBST and several state-of-the-art methods on a broad range of publicly available datasets.	Semantic Scholar
HBST is available as a compact open-source C++ header-only library.	Semantic Scholar
Emotional disorders and psychological flourishing are the result of complex interactions between positive and negative affects that depend on external events and the subject’s internal representations.	Semantic Scholar
Based on psychological data, we mathematically model the dynamical balance between positive and negative affects as a function of the response to external positive and negative events.	Semantic Scholar
This modeling allows the investigation of the relative impact of two leading forms of therapy on affect balance.	Semantic Scholar
The model uses a delay differential equation to analytically study the bifurcation diagram of the system.	Semantic Scholar
We compare the results of the model to psychological data on a single, recurrently depressed patient who was administered the two types of therapies considered (coping focused versus affect focused).	Semantic Scholar
The model leads to the prediction that stabilization at a normal state may rely on evaluating one’s emotional state through a historical ongoing emotional state rather than in a narrow present window.	Semantic Scholar
The simple mathematical model proposed here offers a theoretical framework for investigating the temporal process of change and parameters of resilience to relapse.	Semantic Scholar
Anytime almost-surely asymptotically optimal planners, such as RRT*, incrementally find paths to every state in the search domain.	Semantic Scholar
This is inefficient once an initial solution is found, as then only states that can provide a <italic> better</italic> solution need to be considered.	Semantic Scholar
Exact knowledge of these states requires solving the problem but can be approximated with heuristics.	Semantic Scholar
This paper formally defines these sets of states and demonstrates how they can be used to analyze arbitrary planning problems.	Semantic Scholar
"It uses the well-known <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$L^2$ </tex-math></inline-formula> norm (i.e., Euclidean distance) to analyze minimum-path-length problems and shows that existing approaches decrease in effectiveness <italic>factorially</italic> (i.e., faster than exponentially) with state dimension."

Semantic Scholar
The importance of this direct informed sampling technique is demonstrated with Informed RRT*.	Semantic Scholar

It is shown experimentally to find better solutions faster than existing techniques on both abstract planning problems and HERB, a two-arm manipulation robot.	Semantic Scholar
This letter presents a noninvasive imaging technique that captures the exact timing and locations of cortical activity sequences that are specific to a cognitive process.	Semantic Scholar
These precise spatiotemporal sequences can be detected in the human brain as specific time-position pattern associated with a cognitive task.	Semantic Scholar
They are consistent with direct measurements of population activity recorded in nonhuman primates, thus suggesting that specific time-position patterns associated with a cognitive task can be identified.	Semantic Scholar
This imaging technique is based on estimating the amplitude of cortical current dipoles from MEG recordings.	Semantic Scholar
Although the spatial resolution of these estimations is poor (approximately 2 cm), the temporal resolution is high (milliseconds).	Semantic Scholar
We show that within these cortical current dipoles, time points of cortical activation can be identified as brief amplitude undulations and that sequences of these transients repeat with millisecond accuracy, hence making it possible to treat the timing of these transients as point processes.	Semantic Scholar
We illustrate the feasibility of finding spatiotemporal templates specific to the cognitive processes associated with following the rhythm of drumbeats that involve the activation at multiple cortical and cerebellar loci.	Semantic Scholar
These templates evolve at an accuracy of a few milliseconds.	Semantic Scholar
This approach can thus pave the way for new perspectives on the relationships between brain dynamics and cognition.	Semantic Scholar
We investigate numeral systems in the lambda calculus; specifically in the linear lambda calculus where terms cannot be copied or erased.	Semantic Scholar
Our interest is threefold: representing numbers in the linear calculus, finding constant time arithmetic operations when possible for successor, addition and predecessor, and finally, efficiently encoding subtraction—an operation that is problematic in many numeral systems.	Semantic Scholar
This paper defines systems that address these points, and in addition provides a characterisation of linear numeral systems.	Semantic Scholar
Uncertain graph models are widely used in real-world applications such as knowledge graphs and social networks.	Semantic Scholar
To capture the uncertainty, each edge in an uncertain graph is associated with an existential probability that signifies the likelihood of the existence of the edge.	Semantic Scholar
One notable issue of querying uncertain graphs is that the results are sometimes uninformative because of the edge uncertainty.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we consider probabilistic reachability queries, which are one of the fundamental classes of graph queries.	Semantic Scholar
To make the results more informative, we adopt a crowdsourcing-based approach to clean the uncertain edges.	Semantic Scholar
However, considering the time and monetary cost of crowdsourcing, it is a problem to efficiently select a limited set of edges for cleaning that maximizes the quality improvement.	Semantic Scholar
We prove that the edge selection problem is #P-hard.	Semantic Scholar
In light of the hardness of the problem, we propose a series of edge selection algorithms, followed by a number of optimization techniques and pruning heuristics for reducing the computation time.	Semantic Scholar
Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed techniques outperform a random selection by up to 27 times in terms of the result quality improvement and the brute-force solution by up to 60 times in terms of the elapsed time.	Semantic Scholar
This work proposes a novel deep network architecture to solve the camera ego-motion estimation problem.	Semantic Scholar
A motion estimation network generally learns features similar to optical flow (OF) fields starting from sequences of images.	Semantic Scholar
This OF can be described by a lower dimensional latent space.	Semantic Scholar
Previous research has shown how to find linear approximations of this space.	Semantic Scholar
We propose to use an autoencoder network to find a nonlinear representation of the OF manifold.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we propose to learn the latent space jointly with the estimation task, so that the learned OF features become a more robust description of the OF input.	Semantic Scholar
We call this novel architecture latent space visual odometry (LS-VO).	Semantic Scholar
The experiments show that LS-VO achieves a considerable increase in performances with respect to baselines, while the number of parameters of the estimation network only slightly increases.	Semantic Scholar
Identifying players in soccer videos is a challenging task, especially in overview shots.	Semantic Scholar
Face recognition is not feasible due to low resolution, and jersey number recognition suffers from low resolution, motion blur and unsuitable player pose.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, a method to improve visual identification using spatial constellations is proposed here.	Semantic Scholar
This method models a spatial constellation as a histogram over relative positions among all players of the team.	Semantic Scholar
sing constellation features might increase identification performance but is not expected to work well as a single mean of identification.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, this constellation-based recognition is combined with jersey number recognition using convolutional neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
Recognizing the numbers on a player’s shirt is the most straight-forward approach, as there is a direct mapping between numbers and players.	Semantic Scholar
Using spatial constellation as a feature for identification is based on the assumption that players do not move randomly over the pitch.	Semantic Scholar
Players rather follow a tactical role such as central defender, winger, forward, etc.	Semantic Scholar
However in soccer, players do not strictly adhere to these roles, variations occur more or less frequently.	Semantic Scholar
By learning constellation models for each player, we avoid a categorical assignment of a player to one single tactical role and therefore incorporate each player’s typical behaviour in terms of switching positions.	Semantic Scholar
The presented player identification process is expressed as an assignment problem.	Semantic Scholar
Here, an optimal assignment of manually labeled trajectories to known player identities is calculated.	Semantic Scholar
Using an assignment problem allows for a flexible fusion of constellation features and jersey numbers by combining the respective cost matrices.	Semantic Scholar
Evaluation is performed on 14 different shots of six different Bundesliga matches.	Semantic Scholar
By combining both modalities, the accuracy is improved from 0.69 to 0.82 when compared with jersey number recognition only.	Semantic Scholar
We introduced a new vehicle that is the latest version of the rough terrain (RT)-Mover series to participate in the 2016 Cybathlon.	Semantic Scholar

We address the problem of transferring the style of a headshot photo to face images.	Semantic Scholar
Existing methods using a single exemplar lead to inaccurate results when the exemplar does not contain sufficient stylized facial components for a given photo.	Semantic Scholar
In this work, we propose an algorithm to stylize face images using multiple exemplars containing different subjects in the same style.	Semantic Scholar
Patch correspondences between an input photo and multiple exemplars are established using a Markov Random Field (MRF), which enables accurate local energy transfer via Laplacian stacks.	Semantic Scholar
As image patches from multiple exemplars are used, the boundaries of facial components on the target image are inevitably inconsistent.	Semantic Scholar
The artifacts are removed by a post-processing step using an edge-preserving filter.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm consistently produces visually pleasing results.	Semantic Scholar

Spike synchrony, which occurs in various cortical areas in response to specific perception, action, and memory tasks, has sparked a long-standing debate on the nature of temporal organization in cortex.	Semantic Scholar
One prominent view is that this type of synchrony facilitates the binding or grouping of separate stimulus components.	Semantic Scholar
We argue instead for a more general function: a measure of the prior probability of incoming stimuli, implemented by long-range, horizontal, intracortical connections.	Semantic Scholar
We show that networks of this kind—pulse-coupled excitatory spiking networks in a noisy environment—can provide a sufficient substrate for stimulus-dependent spike synchrony.	Semantic Scholar
This allows for a quick (few spikes) estimate of the match between inputs and the input history as encoded in the network structure.	Semantic Scholar
Given the ubiquity of small, strongly excitatory subnetworks in cortex, we thus propose that many experimental observations of spike synchrony can be viewed as signs of input patterns that resemble long-term experience—that is, of patterns with high prior probability.	Semantic Scholar
Spatial verification methods permit geometrically stable image matching, but still involve a difficult trade-off between robustness as regards incorrect rejection of true correspondences and discriminative power in terms of mismatches.	Semantic Scholar
To address this issue, we ask whether an ensemble of weak geometric constraints that correlates with visual similarity only slightly better than a bag-of-visual-words model performs better than a single strong constraint.	Semantic Scholar
We consider a family of spatial verification methods and decompose them into fundamental constraints imposed on pairs of feature correspondences.	Semantic Scholar
Encompassing such constraints leads us to propose a new method, which takes the best of existing techniques and functions as a unified Ensemble of pAirwise GEometric Relations (EAGER), in terms of both spatial contexts and between-image transformations.	Semantic Scholar
We also introduce a novel and robust reranking method, in which the object instances localized by EAGER in high-ranked database images are reissued as new queries.	Semantic Scholar
EAGER is extended to develop a smoothness constraint where the similarity between the optimized ranking scores of two instances should be maximally consistent with their geometrically constrained similarity.	Semantic Scholar
Reranking is newly formulated as two label propagation problems: one is to assess the confidence of new queries and the other to aggregate new independently executed retrievals.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets show that EAGER and our reranking method outperform most of their state-of-the-art counterparts, especially when large-scale visual vocabularies are used.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we attempt to evaluate the user preferences for web design attributes (i.e., typography, color, content quality, interactivity, and navigation) to determine the trust, satisfaction, and loyalty for uncertainty avoidance cultures.	Semantic Scholar
Content quality and navigation have been observed as strong factors in building user trust with e-commerce websites.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast, interactivity, color, and typography have been observed as strong determinants of user satisfaction.	Semantic Scholar
The most relevant and interesting finding is related to typography, which has been rarely discussed in e-commerce literature.	Semantic Scholar
A questionnaire was designed to collect data to corroborate the proposed model and hypotheses.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the partial least-squares method was adopted to analyze the collected data from the students who participated in the test ($n$ = 558).	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the results of this study provide strong support to the proposed model and hypotheses.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, all the web design attributes were observed as important design features to develop user trust and satisfaction for uncertainty avoidance cultures.	Semantic Scholar
Although both factors seem to be relevant, the relationship between trust and loyalty was observed to be stronger than between satisfaction and loyalty; thus, trust seems to be a stronger determinant of loyalty for risk/high uncertainty avoidance cultures.	Semantic Scholar
Artificial vision algorithms are approaching human performance in many respects.	Semantic Scholar
However, their computational demands are also growing, which constraints their use in mobile and time-sensitive robots.	Semantic Scholar
Biological vision presents a well known practical solution.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, primates limit the computational demands of vision by processing only small parts of the scene in detail, and frequently reorienting the eyes to different locations.	Semantic Scholar
Artificial vision is much more power-intensive than biological vision, so this strategy is likely to be increasingly relevant to robots, as they become more visually sophisticated.	Semantic Scholar
To facilitate progress and reduce duplication of work in this area, we have developed a 7-degree-of-freedom robotic head that supports such rapid saccade-like camera movements, and we are releasing the design files under an open-hardware license.	Semantic Scholar
The system supports C-mount cameras, large foveated lenses, and liquid lenses that allow rapid changes in focus distance.	Semantic Scholar
It also has a stereo baseline that is roughly the same as that of humans, to support stereo processing of nearby objects in grasping and manipulation tasks.	Semantic Scholar
The main contributions of this work are the mechanical design, and the demonstration that its stereo baseline, range of motion, and saccade velocity are similar to those of primate systems.	Semantic Scholar
The main general advantages over existing robotic heads are speed and the open-hardware license.	Semantic Scholar
The system would also be an ideal platform for future research that aims to replicate the performance of primate vision systems.	Semantic Scholar
Event-based cameras are a new passive sensing modality with a number of benefits over traditional cameras, including extremely low latency, asynchronous data acquisition, high dynamic range, and very low power consumption.	Semantic Scholar
There has been a lot of recent interest and development in applying algorithms to use the events to perform a variety of three-dimensional perception tasks, such as feature tracking, visual odometry, and stereo depth estimation.	Semantic Scholar
However, there currently lacks the wealth of labeled data that exists for traditional cameras to be used for both testing and development.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we present a large dataset with a synchronized stereo pair event based camera system, carried on a handheld rig, flown by a hexacopter, driven on top of a car, and mounted on a motorcycle, in a variety of different illumination levels and environments.	Semantic Scholar
From each camera, we provide the event stream, grayscale images, and inertial measurement unit (IMU) readings.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we utilize a combination of IMU, a rigidly mounted lidar system, indoor and outdoor motion capture, and GPS to provide accurate pose and depth images for each camera at up to 100 Hz.	Semantic Scholar
For comparison, we also provide synchronized grayscale images and IMU readings from a frame-based stereo camera system.	Semantic Scholar
Cloth manipulation by robots is gaining popularity among researchers because of its relevance, mainly (but not only) in domestic and assistive robotics.	Semantic Scholar
The required science and technologies begin to be ripe for the challenges posed by the manipulation of soft materials, and many contributions have appeared in the last years.	Semantic Scholar
This survey provides a systematic review of existing techniques for the basic perceptual tasks of grasp point localization, state estimation and classification of cloth items, from the perspective of their manipulation by robots.	Semantic Scholar
This choice is grounded on the fact that any manipulative action requires to instruct the robot where to grasp, and most garment handling activities depend on the correct recognition of the type to which the particular cloth item belongs and its state.	Semantic Scholar
The high interand intraclass variability of garments, the continuous nature of the possible deformations of cloth and the evident difficulties in predicting their localization and extension on the garment piece are challenges that have encouraged the researchers to provide a plethora of methods to confront such problems, with some promising results.	Semantic Scholar
The present review constitutes for the first time an effort in furnishing a structured framework of these works, with the aim of helping future contributors to gain both insight and perspective on the subject.	Semantic Scholar
Among numerous applications of medical robotics, this paper concentrates on the design, optimal use and maintenance of the related technologies in the context of healthcare, rehabilitation and assistive robotics, and provides a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in the foregoing field of science and technology, while extensively dealing with the possible applications of participatory and opportunistic mobile sensing in the aforementioned domains.	Semantic Scholar
The main motivation for the latter choice is the variety of such applications in the settings having partial contributions to functionalities such as artery, radiosurgery, neurosurgery and vascular intervention.	Semantic Scholar
From a broad perspective, the aforementioned applications can be realized via various strategies and devices benefiting from detachable drives, intelligent robots, human-centric sensing and computing, miniature and micro-robots.	Semantic Scholar
Throughout the paper tens of subjects, including sensor-fusion, kinematic, dynamic and 3D tissue models are discussed based on the existing literature on the state-of-the-art technologies.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, from a managerial perspective, topics such as safety monitoring, security, privacy and evolutionary optimization of the operational efficiency are reviewed.	Semantic Scholar
The skyline of a data point set is made up of the best points in the set, and is very important for multi-criteria decision making.	Semantic Scholar
In these years, the skyline problem attracts more and more attention, and many variants of the traditional skyline emerge in the database field.	Semantic Scholar
One recent and important variant is group-based skyline, which aims to find the best groups of points in a given set.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we bring forward an efficient approach, called minimum dominance search (MDS), to solve the g-skyline problem, a latest group-based skyline problem.	Semantic Scholar
MDS consists of two steps: In the first step, we construct a novel g-skyline support structure, i.e., minimum dominance graph (MDG), which proves to be a minimum g-skyline support structure.	Semantic Scholar
In the second step, we search for g-skyline groups based on the MDG through two searching algorithms, and a skyline-combination based optimization strategy is employed to improve these two algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
We conduct comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets, and show that our algorithms are orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art in most cases.	Semantic Scholar
This letter addresses the problem of causal velocity estimation of motion signals exhibiting sudden velocity changes.	Semantic Scholar
It is explicitly assumed that only sampled quantized position data are available, and that no dynamic system model is at hand, to allow for an effective solution with minimal a priori information.	Semantic Scholar
Our solution consists of a finite-response filter with adaptive window length and a velocity jump detection algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
A velocity jump is detected when the difference between sampled position data and predicted position is larger than a parametric threshold.	Semantic Scholar
The specific value for the threshold is obtained via an analytical formula that depends on sampling time, maximum allowed variation in acceleration (away from velocity jumps), and encoder resolution.	Semantic Scholar
The developed method is first demonstrated on simulated quantized data corresponding to a bouncing motion and its performance compared to that of other existing non-model-based methods.	Semantic Scholar
Its effectiveness is furthermore illustrated by means of trajectory tracking results on an experimental setup experiencing impacts.	Semantic Scholar
Sonifying handwriting, i.e., transforming some characteristics of handwriting movement into sounds, aims to improve handwriting perception, evaluation, and control.	Semantic Scholar
The educative or clinical interest is to make hidden variables of handwriting, which are not accessible through a visual inspection of the trace, perceptible and useful for novice or poor writers.	Semantic Scholar
From a theoretical point of view, handwriting sonification might be a powerful tool for assessing multisensory integration in motor control and learning.	Semantic Scholar
In a brief introduction, the main studies on handwriting sonification are reported and the interest of handwriting movement sonification is justified.	Semantic Scholar
Then, the project of sonification is described, with a specific focus on select variables of handwriting movement and associated sounds.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental validations of this sonification strategy are presented, followed by a conclusion and a few theoretical perspectives.	Semantic Scholar

This letter presents the Passive Return Electro-Hydrostatic Actuator (PREHydrA), an actuator for use in wearable robotics.	Semantic Scholar
It eliminates conventional hydraulic systems’ fluid supply and valves, potentially making it lighter, more efficient, and simpler.	Semantic Scholar
It also avoids the configuration-dependent friction of Bowden cable transmissions.	Semantic Scholar
A physical port-based network model was created of the PREHydrA that predicts force tracking with a maximum error of about 4 N. Closed loop output force control was used in experiments to obtain a mean absolute tracking error below 4 N for force references from 300 N amplitude at 0.5 Hz to 20 N amplitude at 10 Hz.

These forces, frequencies, and corresponding velocities (up to 0.47 m/s) demonstrate that the PREHydrA's performance is sufficient for many wearable applications.	Semantic Scholar

Since the beginning of robotics, the substitution of human labor has been one of the crucial issues.	Semantic Scholar
The focus is on the economic perspective, asking how robotics affects the labor market, and on changes in the work processes of human workers.	Semantic Scholar
While there are already some lessons learnt from industrial robotics, the area of service robots has been analyzed to a much lesser extent.	Semantic Scholar
First insights into these aspects are of utmost relevance to technology assessment providing policy advice.	Semantic Scholar
As conclusions for service robots in general cannot be drawn, we identify criteria for the ex-ante evaluation of service robots in concrete application areas.	Semantic Scholar

In particular, TLRMVR integrates low-rank multi-view embedding and regression analysis into a unified framework such that the lowest-rank representation shared by all views not only captures the global structure of all views, but also indicates the regression requirements.	Semantic Scholar
The framework is formulated as a regression model and it seeks a set of view-specific projection matrices with low-rank constraints to map multi-view features into a common subspace.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, a multi-graph regularization term is constructed to improve the generalization capability and further prevents the overfitting problem.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments conducted on a publicly available dataset demonstrate that our proposed method achieve promising results as compared with state-of-the-art baselines.	Semantic Scholar
Community Question Answering (CQA) sites, such as Stack Overflow and Yahoo!	Semantic Scholar
Answers, have become very popular in recent years.	Semantic Scholar
These sites contain rich crowdsourcing knowledge contributed by the site users in the form of questions and answers, and these questions and answers can satisfy the information needs of more users.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we aim at predicting the voting scores of questions/answers shortly after they are posted in the CQA sites.	Semantic Scholar
To accomplish this task, we identify three key aspects that matter with the voting of a post, i.e., the non-linear relationships between features and output, the question and answer coupling, and the dynamic fashion of data arrivals.	Semantic Scholar
A family of algorithms are proposed to model the above three key aspects.	Semantic Scholar
Some approximations and extensions are also proposed to scale up the computation.	Semantic Scholar
We analyze the proposed algorithms in terms of optimality, correctness, and complexity.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on two real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
Vibrotactile feedback systems for supporting human motion have been widely researched, mainly owing to the low price and reduced size of vibration motors, which allow trainees to actively move while using them.	Semantic Scholar
Most existing vibrotactile feedback systems focus on providing information about the human's joint angles, making it necessary to understand multiple simultaneous stimuli to guide the trajectory of a limb.	Semantic Scholar
Instead, in the present study, we focus on guiding the motion of the hand by following an endpoint approach and propose a vibrotactile feedback paradigm to convey a direction around the wrist and guide the user's wrist around points in a two-dimensional Cartesian space.	Semantic Scholar
In the path-following task, vibrotactile cues are provided as direction information to modify the wrist's path only when the wrist's position deviates significantly from the desired path.	Semantic Scholar
The experiment was designed based on the motor learning process to observe the evolution of performance during training.	Semantic Scholar
We found that the root mean squared error of participants decreased by 49.3% when provided with vibrotactile feedback.	Semantic Scholar
This effect was almost constant throughout training.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, most participants could reproduce the desired path after removing the provided feedback immediately after training.	Semantic Scholar
We believe the proposed system can be applied to enhance the process of learning tasks that require hand guidance, such as learning of Japanese calligraphy or upper limb rehabilitation.	Semantic Scholar
Query expansion has been widely adopted in Web search as a way of tackling the ambiguity of queries.	Semantic Scholar
Personalized search utilizing folksonomy data has demonstrated an extreme vocabulary mismatch problem that requires even more effective query expansion methods.	Semantic Scholar
Co-occurrence statistics, tag-tag relationships, and semantic matching approaches are among those favored by previous research.	Semantic Scholar
However, user profiles which only contain a user's past annotation information may not be enough to support the selection of expansion terms, especially for users with limited previous activity with the system.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel model to construct enriched user profiles with the help of an external corpus for personalized query expansion.	Semantic Scholar
Our model integrates the current state-of-the-art text representation learning framework, known as word embeddings, with topic models in two groups of pseudo-aligned documents.	Semantic Scholar
Based on user profiles, we build two novel query expansion techniques.	Semantic Scholar
These two techniques are based on topical weights-enhanced word embeddings, and the topical relevance between the query and the terms inside a user profile, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
The results of an in-depth experimental evaluation, performed on two real-world datasets using different external corpora, show that our approach outperforms traditional techniques, including existing non-personalized and personalized query expansion methods.	Semantic Scholar
Policy search (PS) algorithms are widely used for their simplicity and effectiveness in finding solutions for robotic problems.	Semantic Scholar
However, most current PS algorithms derive policies by statistically fitting the data from the best experiments only.	Semantic Scholar
This means that experiments yielding a poor performance are usually discarded or given too little influence on the policy update.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a generalization of the relative entropy policy search (REPS) algorithm that takes bad experiences into consideration when computing a policy.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach, named dual REPS (DREPS) following the philosophical interpretation of the duality between good and bad, finds clusters of experimental data yielding a poor behavior and adds them to the optimization problem as a repulsive constraint.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, considering that there is a duality between good and bad data samples, both are taken into account in the stochastic search for a policy.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, a cluster with the best samples may be included as an attractor to enforce faster convergence to a single optimal solution in multimodal problems.	Semantic Scholar
We first tested our proposed approach in a simulated reinforcement learning setting and found that DREPS considerably speeds up the learning process, especially during the early optimization steps and in cases where other approaches get trapped in between several alternative maxima.	Semantic Scholar
Further experiments in which a real robot had to learn a task with a multimodal reward function confirm the advantages of our proposed approach with respect to REPS.	Semantic Scholar
Learning useful information across long time lags is a critical and difficult problem for temporal neural models in tasks such as language modeling.	Semantic Scholar
Existing architectures that address the issue are often complex and costly to train.	Semantic Scholar
The differential state framework (DSF) is a simple and high-performing design that unifies previously introduced gated neural models.	Semantic Scholar
DSF models maintain longer-term memory by learning to interpolate between a fast-changing data-driven representation and a slowly changing, implicitly stable state.	Semantic Scholar
Within the DSF framework, a new architecture is presented, the delta-RNN.	Semantic Scholar
This model requires hardly any more parameters than a classical, simple recurrent network.	Semantic Scholar
In language modeling at the word and character levels, the delta-RNN outperforms popular complex architectures, such as the long short-term memory (LSTM) and the gated recurrent unit (GRU), and, when regularized, performs comparably to several state-of-the-art baselines.	Semantic Scholar
At the subword level, the delta-RNN's performance is comparable to that of complex gated architectures.	Semantic Scholar
Recent experiments have shown that stereotypical spatiotemporal patterns occur during brief packets of spiking activity in the cortex, and it has been suggested that top-down inputs can modulate these patterns according to the context.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a simple model that may explain important features of these experimental observations and is analytically tractable.	Semantic Scholar
The key mechanism underlying this model is that context-dependent top-down inputs can modulate the effective connection strengths between neurons because of short-term synaptic depression.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, the degree of synchrony and, in turn, the spatiotemporal patterns of spiking activity that occur during packets are modulated by the top-down inputs.	Semantic Scholar
This is shown using an analytical framework, based on avalanche dynamics, that allows calculating the probability that a given neuron spikes during a packet and numerical simulations.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we show that the spatiotemporal patterns that replay previously experienced sequential stimuli and their binding with their corresponding context can be learned because of spike-timing-dependent plasticity.	Semantic Scholar
Real-time bidding (RTB) based display advertising has become one of the key technological advances in computational advertising.	Semantic Scholar
RTB enables advertisers to buy individual ad impressions via an auction in real-time and facilitates the evaluation and the bidding of individual impressions across multiple advertisers.	Semantic Scholar
In RTB, the advertisers face three main challenges when optimizing their bidding strategies, namely (i) estimating the utility (e.g., conversions, clicks) of the ad impression, (ii) forecasting the market value (thus the cost) of the given ad impression, and (iii) deciding the optimal bid for the given auction based on the first two.	Semantic Scholar
Previous solutions assume the first two are solved before addressing the bid optimization problem.	Semantic Scholar
However, these challenges are strongly correlated and dealing with any individual problem independently may not be globally optimal.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose Bidding Machine, a comprehensive learning to bid framework, which consists of three optimizers dealing with each challenge above, and as a whole, jointly optimizes these three parts.	Semantic Scholar
We show that such a joint optimization would largely increase the campaign effectiveness and the profit.	Semantic Scholar
From the learning perspective, we show that the bidding machine can be updated smoothly with both offline periodical batch or online sequential training schemes.	Semantic Scholar
Our extensive offline empirical study and online A/B testing verify the high effectiveness of the proposed bidding machine.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we address the problem of sampling from a set and reconstructing a set stored as a Bloom filter.	Semantic Scholar
To the best of our knowledge our work is the first to address this question.	Semantic Scholar
"We introduce a novel hierarchical data structure called <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mathsf{BloomSampleTree}$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""sengupta-ieq1-2785803.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> that helps us design efficient algorithms to extract an almost uniform sample from the set stored in a Bloom filter and also allows us to reconstruct the set efficiently."	Semantic Scholar
In the case where the hash functions used in the Bloom filter implementation are partially invertible, in the sense that it is easy to calculate the set of elements that map to a particular hash value, we propose a second, more space-efficient method called HashInvert for the reconstruction.	Semantic Scholar
We study the properties of these two methods both analytically as well as experimentally.	Semantic Scholar
"We provide bounds on run times for both methods and sample quality for the <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mathsf{BloomSampleTree}$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""sengupta-ieq2-2785803.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> based algorithm, and show through an extensive experimental evaluation that our methods are efficient and effective."

Caging offers a robust strategy for grasping objects with robot hands.	Semantic Scholar
This letter describes an efficient caging-to-grasping algorithm for polygonal objects using minimalistic three-finger robot hands.	Semantic Scholar
This letter describes how to cage and then grasp polygonal objects, using single actuator triangular three-finger formations, whose shape is determined by any desired immobilizing grasp of the polygonal object.	Semantic Scholar
While the hand's configuration space is four-dimensional, the algorithm uses the hand's two-dimensional contact space, which represents all two- and three-finger contacts along the grasped object boundary.	Semantic Scholar
This letter describes how the problem of computing the critical cage formation that allows the object to escape the hand is reduced to a search along a caging graph constructed in the hand's contact space.	Semantic Scholar
Starting from a desired immobilizing grasp, the graph is searched for the critical cage formation, which is used to determine the  caging regions surrounding the immobilizing grasp.	Semantic Scholar
Any three-finger placement within these regions guarantees robust object grasping.	Semantic Scholar
The technique is demonstrated with a detailed computational example and a video clip, which shows caging experiments with a single actuator three-finger robot hand.	Semantic Scholar
Several methods have been proposed for robotic assistance in motor learning/training.	Semantic Scholar
However, a few major concerns such as the design of the natural motion of the hand of a trainee/patient by a robotic device considering the motor ability of the trainee/patient and a safe and effective method for teaching a trainee/patient, especially in a complex task requiring motor timing, still need to be addressed.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes velocity-based robotic assistance (VRA) using a bio-mimetic trajectory generation model formotor skill training in a target-hitting task considering the concernsmentioned above.	Semantic Scholar
In the designed motor task, a trainee has to contact an approaching ball with a racket at the desired time to hit the target on the wall while predicting the behavior of the ball before and after the contact.	Semantic Scholar
A set of the racket angle and hand velocity at the contact time is defined as a task-related motor skill.	Semantic Scholar
In the motor training with VRA, the time scale of a primitive reference velocity profile is automatically adapted to individual levels of task-related motor skills recorded in the past trials with no robotic assistance.	Semantic Scholar
The robotic device then teaches the trainee the customized reference velocity profile to facilitate motor skill training.	Semantic Scholar
The effect of VRA on motor skill training in a target-hitting task was investigated with sixteen healthy volunteers (male university students aged 22–24 years) to verify the concept in this pilot study.	Semantic Scholar
The skilled hand movement for the designed motor task was first determined using a set of results measured from four skilled subjects, and the primitive reference velocity profile with multiple peaks was successfully regenerated in a minimum-jerk model by utilizing the task-related constraints.	Semantic Scholar
Next, a set of training experiments with and without VRA was conducted with twelve subjects who have no experience in the target task.	Semantic Scholar
The results for the healthy subjects of this pilot study demonstrated that the proposed VRA was efficacious in facilitating the acquisition of task-related motor skills (with almost half trials) and in reducing temporal errors of the desired velocity (by approximately 40%).	Semantic Scholar

Sentence auto-completion is an important feature that saves users many keystrokes in typing the entire sentence by providing suggestions as they type.	Semantic Scholar
Despite its value, the existing sentence auto-completion methods, such as query completion models, can hardly be applied to solving the object completion problem in sentences with the form of (subject, verb, object), due to the complex natural language description and the data deficiency problem.	Semantic Scholar
Towards this goal, we treat an SVO sentence as a three-element triple (subject, sentence pattern, object), and cast the sentence object completion problem as an element inference problem.	Semantic Scholar
These elements in all triples are encoded into a unified low-dimensional embedding space by our proposed TRANSFER model, which leverages the external knowledge base to strengthen the representation learning performance.	Semantic Scholar
With such representations, we can provide reliable candidates for the desired missing element by a linear model.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset have well-validated our model.	Semantic Scholar
Meanwhile, we have successfully applied our proposed model to factoid question answering systems for answer candidate selection, which further demonstrates the applicability of the TRANSFER model.	Semantic Scholar
Magnetic continuum robots (m-CR) have grown interest in several applicative contexts that take benefits from their high flexibility and remote control.	Semantic Scholar
When submitted to external magnetic fields, m-CR exhibit large elastic deformations, which may lead to a highly nonlinear and complex behavior that is yet difficult to analyze.	Semantic Scholar
This letter aims to provide a tool to improve the understanding of m-CR kinematics.	Semantic Scholar
To do so, a numerical approach composed of continuation methods and bifurcation analysis is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
The numerical tool is first described.	Semantic Scholar
Qualitative and quantitative results are further introduced by computing multiple equilibrium branches and bifurcations of m-CR configurations within homogeneous and inhomogeneous magnetic fields.	Semantic Scholar
Our simulations are ultimately compared to experimental data using a magnetic navigation system.	Semantic Scholar
With recent advances in data-as-a-service (DaaS) and cloud computing, aggregate query services over set-valued data are becoming widely available for business intelligence that drives decision making.	Semantic Scholar
However, as the service provider is often a third-party delegate of the data owner, the integrity of the query results cannot be guaranteed and is thus imperative to be authenticated.	Semantic Scholar
Unfortunately, existing query authentication techniques either do not work for set-valued data or they lack data confidentiality.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose authenticated aggregate queries over set-valued data that not only ensure the integrity of query results but also preserve the confidentiality of source data.	Semantic Scholar
As many aggregate queries are composed of multiset operations such as set union and subset, we first develop a family of privacy-preserving authentication protocols for primitive multiset operations.	Semantic Scholar
Using these protocols as building blocks, we present a privacy-preserving authentication framework for various aggregate queries and further optimize their authentication performance.	Semantic Scholar
Security analysis and empirical evaluation show that our proposed privacy-preserving authentication techniques are feasible and robust under a wide range of system workloads.	Semantic Scholar
Determining the types of vegetation present in an image is a core step in many precision agriculture tasks.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we focus on pixel-based approaches for classification of crops versus weeds, especially for complex cases involving overlapping plants and partial occlusion.	Semantic Scholar
We examine the benefits of multiscale and content-driven morphology-based descriptors called attribute profiles.	Semantic Scholar
These are compared to the state-of-the-art keypoint descriptors with a fixed neighborhood previously used in precision agriculture, namely histograms of oriented gradients and local binary patterns.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed classification technique is especially advantageous when coupled with morphology-based segmentation on a max-tree structure, as the same representation can be reused for feature extraction.	Semantic Scholar
The robustness of the approach is demonstrated by an experimental evaluation on two datasets with different crop types, while being able to provide descriptors at a higher resolution.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed approach compared favorably to the state-of-the-art approaches without an increase in computational complexity, while being able to provide descriptors at a higher resolution.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we present the Menpo 2D and Menpo 3D benchmarks, two new datasets for multi-pose 2D and 3D facial landmark localisation and tracking.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to the previous benchmarks such as 300W and 300VW, the proposed benchmarks contain facial images in both semi-frontal and profile pose.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce an elaborate semi-automatic methodology for providing high-quality annotations for both the Menpo 2D and Menpo 3D benchmarks.	Semantic Scholar
In Menpo 2D benchmark, different visible landmark configurations are designed for semi-frontal and profile faces, thus making the 2D face alignment full-pose.	Semantic Scholar
In Menpo 3D benchmark, a united landmark configuration is designed for both semi-frontal and profile faces based on the correspondence with a 3D face model, thus making face alignment not only full-pose but also corresponding to the real-world 3D space.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the considerable number of annotated images, we organised Menpo 2D Challenge and Menpo 3D Challenge for face alignment under large pose variations in conjunction with CVPR 2017 and ICCV 2017, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
The results of these challenges demonstrate that recent deep learning architectures, when trained with the abundant data, lead to excellent results.	Semantic Scholar
We also provide a very simple, yet effective solution, named Cascade Multi-view Hourglass Model, to 2D and 3D face alignment.	Semantic Scholar
In our method, we take advantage of all 2D and 3D facial landmark annotations in a joint way.	Semantic Scholar
We not only capitalise on the correspondences between the semi-frontal and profile 2D facial landmarks but also employ joint supervision from both 2D and 3D facial landmarks.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we discuss future directions on the topic of face alignment.	Semantic Scholar
Multi-label classification has received considerable interest in recent years.	Semantic Scholar
Multi-label classifiers usually need to address many issues including: handling large-scale datasets with many instances and a large set of labels, compensating missing label assignments in the training set, considering correlations between labels, as well as exploiting unlabeled data to improve prediction performance.	Semantic Scholar
To tackle datasets with a large set of labels, embedding-based methods represent the label assignments in a low-dimensional space.	Semantic Scholar
Many state-of-the-art embedding-based methods use a linear dimensionality reduction to map the label assignments to a low-dimensional space.	Semantic Scholar
However, by doing so, these methods actually neglect the tail labels - labels that are infrequently assigned to instances.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose an embedding-based method that non-linearly embeds the label vectors using a stochastic approach, thereby predicting the tail labels more accurately.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, the proposed method has excellent mechanisms for handling missing labels, dealing with large-scale datasets, as well as exploiting unlabeled data.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers by a large margin, in terms of prediction performance, as well as training time.	Semantic Scholar
Our implementation of the proposed method is available online at:https://github.com/Akbarnejad/ESMC_ Implementation.	Semantic Scholar

Semantic Scholar
To ensure successful magnetic resonance navigation of a microrobot along consecutive channels, the design of autonomous navigation strategy is needed, taking into account the major MRI technological constraints and physiological perturbations, e.g., nonnegligible pulsatile flow, limitations on the magnetic gradient amplitude, MRI overheating, and susceptibility artifacts uncertainties.	Semantic Scholar
An optimal navigation planning framework based on Pareto optimality is proposed in order to deal with this multiple-objective problem.	Semantic Scholar
Based on these optimal conditions, a dedicated control architecture has been implemented in an interventional medical platform for real-time propulsion, control, and imaging experiments.	Semantic Scholar

Considering a set of robotic tasks which involve physical interaction with the environment, the theoretical knowledge of the full force capacity of the manipulator is a key factor in the design or development of an efficient and economically attractive solution.	Semantic Scholar
Carrying its own weight while countering forces may be too much for a robot in certain configurations.	Semantic Scholar
Kinematic redundancy with regard to a task allows a robot to perform it in a continuous space of articular configurations; space in which the payload of the robot may vary dramatically.	Semantic Scholar
It may be impossible to withstand a physical interaction in some configurations, while it may be easily sustainable in others that bring the end-effector to the same location.	Semantic Scholar
This becomes obviously more prevalent for a limited payload robot.	Semantic Scholar
This letter describes a framework for these kind of operations, in which kinematic redundancy is used to explore the full extent of a force capacity for a given manipulator and task (in this letter, the terms “force” and “wrench” may interchangeably refer to two-, three-, or six-dimensional forces depending on the dimension of the problem and on whether they may or may not include components of translational forces and/or moments.	Semantic Scholar
Their dimensional definition will be explicitly given whenever specifically needed).	Semantic Scholar
A pragmatic force capacity index (FCI) is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
The FCI offers a sound basis for redundancy resolution via optimization or complete redundancy exploration, and may provide good hints for end-effector design.	Semantic Scholar
A practical use case involving 7-DOFs KUKA LBR iiwa was used to demonstrate the relevance of the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
Neural decoding may be formulated as dynamic state estimation (filtering) based on point-process observations, a generally intractable problem.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical sampling techniques are often practically useful for the decoding of real neural data.	Semantic Scholar
However, they are less useful as theoretical tools for modeling and understanding sensory neural systems, since they lead to limited conceptual insight into optimal encoding and decoding strategies.	Semantic Scholar
We consider sensory neural populations characterized by a distribution over neuron parameters.	Semantic Scholar
We develop an analytically tractable Bayesian approximation to optimal filtering based on the observation of spiking activity that greatly facilitates the analysis of optimal encoding in situations deviating from common assumptions of uniform coding.	Semantic Scholar
Continuous distributions are used to approximate large populations with few parameters, resulting in a filter whose complexity does not grow with population size and allowing optimization of population parameters rather than individual tuning functions.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical comparison with particle filtering demonstrates the quality of the approximation.	Semantic Scholar
The analytic framework leads to insights that are difficult to obtain from numerical algorithms and is consistent with biological observations about the distribution of sensory cells' preferred stimuli.	Semantic Scholar

With the advances in geo-positioning technologies and location-based services, it is nowadays quite common for road networks to have textual contents on the vertices.	Semantic Scholar
Previous work on identifying an optimal route that covers a sequence of query keywords has been studied in recent years.	Semantic Scholar
However, in many practical scenarios, an optimal route might not always be desirable.	Semantic Scholar
For example, a personalized route query is issued by providing some clues that describe the spatial context between PoIs along the route, where the result can be far from the optimal one.	Semantic Scholar
"Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the problem of clue-based route search (<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">${\sf {CRS}}$ </tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""zheng-ieq1-2703848.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula>), which allows a user to provide clues on keywords and spatial relationships."

First, we propose a greedy algorithm and a dynamic programming algorithm as baselines.	Semantic Scholar
To improve efficiency, we develop a branch-and-bound algorithm that prunes unnecessary vertices in query processing.	Semantic Scholar
In order to quickly locate candidate, we propose an AB-tree that stores both the distance and keyword information in tree structure.	Semantic Scholar
To further reduce the index size, we construct a PB-tree by utilizing the virtue of 2-hop label index to pinpoint the candidate.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments are conducted and verify the superiority of our algorithms and index structures.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we study the confounder detection problem in the linear model, where the target variable Y is predicted using its n potential causes Xn=(x1,…,xn)T. Based on an assumption of a rotation-invariant generating process of the model, recent study shows that the spectral measure induced by the regression coefficient vector with respect to the covariance matrix of Xn is close to a uniform measure in purely causal cases, but it differs from a uniform measure characteristically in the presence of a scalar confounder.	Semantic Scholar
Analyzing spectral measure patterns could help to detect confounding.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose to use the first moment of the spectral measure for confounder detection.	Semantic Scholar
We calculate the first moment of the regression vector–induced spectral measure and compare it with the first moment of a uniform spectral measure, both defined with respect to the covariance matrix of Xn.	Semantic Scholar
The two moments coincide in nonconfounding cases and differ from each other in the presence of confounding.	Semantic Scholar
This statistical causal-confounding asymmetry can be used for confounder detection.	Semantic Scholar
Without the need to analyze the spectral measure pattern, our method avoids the difficulty of metric choice and multiple parameter optimization.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on synthetic and real data show the performance of this method.	Semantic Scholar
Successful operation of off-road mobile robots faces the challenge of mobility hazards posed by soft, deformable terrain, e.g., sand traps.	Semantic Scholar
The slip caused by these hazards has a significant impact on tractive efficiency, leading to complete immobilization in extreme circumstances.	Semantic Scholar
This paper addresses the interaction between dry frictional soil and the multilegged wheel–leg concept, with the aim of exploiting its enhanced mobility for safe, in situ terrain sensing.	Semantic Scholar
The influence of multiple legs and different foot designs on wheel–leg–soil interaction is analyzed by incorporating these aspects to an existing terradynamics model.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, new theoretical models are proposed and experimentally validated to relate wheel–leg slip to both motor torque and stick-slip vibrations.	Semantic Scholar
These models, which are capable of estimating wheel–leg slip from purely proprioceptive sensors, are then applied in combination with detected wheel–leg sinkage to successfully characterize the load bearing and shear strength properties of different types of deformable soil.	Semantic Scholar
The main contribution of this paper enables nongeometric hazard detection based on detected wheel–leg slip and sinkage.	Semantic Scholar

An eccentric paddle locomotion mechanism based on the epicyclic gear mechanism (ePaddle-EGM), which was proposed to enhance the mobility of amphibious robots in multiterrain tasks, can perform various terrestrial and aquatic gaits.	Semantic Scholar
Two of the feasible aquatic gaits are the rotational paddling gait and the oscillating paddling gait.	Semantic Scholar
The former one has been studied in our previous work, and a capacity of generating vectored thrust has been found.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we focus on the oscillating paddling gait by measuring the generated thrusts of the gait on an ePaddle-EGM prototype module.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results verify that the oscillating paddling gait can generate vectored thrust by changing the location of the paddle shaft as well.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we compare the oscillating paddling gait with the rotational paddling gait at the vectored thrusting property, magnitude of the thrust, and the gait efficiency.	Semantic Scholar
In this work we address the challenging problem of 3D human pose estimation from single images.	Semantic Scholar
Recent approaches learn deep neural networks to regress 3D pose directly from images.	Semantic Scholar
One major challenge for such methods, however, is the collection of training data.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, collecting large amounts of training data containing unconstrained images annotated with accurate 3D poses is infeasible.	Semantic Scholar
We therefore propose to use two independent training sources.	Semantic Scholar
The first source consists of accurate 3D motion capture data, and the second source consists of unconstrained images with annotated 2D poses.	Semantic Scholar
To integrate both sources, we propose a dual-source approach that combines 2D pose estimation with efficient 3D pose retrieval.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we first convert the motion capture data into a normalized 2D pose space, and separately learn a 2D pose estimation model from the image data.	Semantic Scholar
During inference, we estimate the 2D pose and efficiently retrieve the nearest 3D poses.	Semantic Scholar
We then jointly estimate a mapping from the 3D pose space to the image and reconstruct the 3D pose.	Semantic Scholar
We provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, even when the skeleton structures of the two sources differ substantially.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present the summary of results from a teleoperation study to assess the application of a mobile robot cornering law with the inclusion of a time delay on the returned video stream.	Semantic Scholar
The intent is to demonstrate this application to an analogous scenario like teleoperating from Earth a rover at the south Lunar pole.	Semantic Scholar
The first experiment compared course completion times for outdoor driving circuits in ideal lighting without time delay, ideal lighting with time delay, and in darkness with time delay and a low-angled spotlight.	Semantic Scholar
The second experiment studied cornering times for various time delays and lighting conditions in an indoor setting.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that teleoperating a mobile robot with the presence of time delay still complies with the previously developed cornering law.	Semantic Scholar
The combined results from the cornering study and the outdoor driving course are interpreted to show that the total time to complete a driving course with a time-delayed video can be predicted based on a known number of turns.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a coupled convolution layer comprising multiple parallel convolutions with mutually constrained filters.	Semantic Scholar
Inspired by biological human vision mechanism, we constrain the convolution filters such that one set of filter weights should be geometrically rotated, mirrored, or be the negative of the other.	Semantic Scholar
Our analysis suggests that the coupled convolution layer is more effective for lower layer where feature maps preserve geometric properties.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental comparisons demonstrate that the proposed coupled convolution layer performs slightly better than the original layer while decreasing the number of parameters.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate its effect compared to non-constrained convolution layer using the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and PlanktonSet 1.0 datasets.	Semantic Scholar
In the big data era, the generation of data presents some new characteristics, including wide distribution, high velocity, high dimensionality, and privacy concern.	Semantic Scholar
To address these challenges for big data analytics, we develop a privacy-preserving distributed online learning framework on the data collected from distributed data sources.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, each node (i.e., data source) has the capacity of learning a model from its local dataset, and exchanges intermediate parameters with a random part of their own neighboring (logically connected) nodes.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, the topology of the communications in our distributed computing framework is unfixed in practice.	Semantic Scholar
As online learning always performs on the sensitive data, we introduce the notion of differential privacy (DP) into our distributed online learning algorithm (DOLA) to protect the data privacy during the learning, which prevents an adversary from inferring any significant sensitive information.	Semantic Scholar
Our model is of general value for big data analytics in the distributed setting, because it can provide rigorous and scalable privacy proof and have much less computational complexity when compared to classic schemes, e.g., secure multiparty computation (SMC).	Semantic Scholar
To tackle high-dimensional incoming data entries, we study a sparse version of the DOLA with novel DP techniques to save the computing resources and improve the utility.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we present two modified private DOLAs to meet the need of practical applications.	Semantic Scholar
One is to convert the DOLA to distributed stochastic optimization in an offline setting, the other is to use the mini-batches approach to reduce the amount of the perturbation noise and improve the utility.	Semantic Scholar
We conduct experiments on real datasets in a configured distributed platform.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical experiment results validate the feasibility of our private DOLAs.	Semantic Scholar
The excellent performance of deep neural networks has enabled us to solve several automatization problems, opening an era of autonomous devices.	Semantic Scholar
However, current deep net architectures are heavy with millions of parameters and require billions of floating point operations.	Semantic Scholar
Several works have been developed to compress a pre-trained deep network to reduce memory footprint and, possibly, computation.	Semantic Scholar
Instead of compressing a pre-trained network, in this work, we propose a generic neural network layer structure employing multilinear projection as the primary feature extractor.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed architecture requires several times less memory as compared to the traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), while inherits the similar design principles of a CNN.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the proposed architecture is equipped with two computation schemes that enable computation reduction or scalability.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show the effectiveness of our compact projection that outperforms traditional CNN, while requiring far fewer parameters.	Semantic Scholar
This letter introduces a novel algorithm for multiagent offline trajectory generation based on distributed model predictive control.	Semantic Scholar
Central to the algorithm's scalability and success is the development of an on-demand collision avoidance strategy.	Semantic Scholar
By predicting future states and sharing this information with their neighbors, the agents are able to detect and avoid collisions while moving toward their goals.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed algorithm can be implemented in a distributed fashion and reduces the computation time by more than 85% compared to previous optimization approaches based on sequential convex programming, while only having a small impact on the optimality of the plans.	Semantic Scholar
The approach was validated both through extensive simulations and experimentally with teams of up to 25 quadrotors flying in confined indoor spaces.	Semantic Scholar
Spatial clustering deals with the unsupervised grouping of places into clusters and finds important applications in urban planning and marketing.	Semantic Scholar
Current spatial clustering models disregard information about the people and the time who and when are related to the clustered places.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we show how the density-based clustering paradigm can be extended to apply on places which are visited by users of a geo-social network.	Semantic Scholar
Our model considers spatio-temporal information and the social relationships between users who visit the clustered places.	Semantic Scholar
After formally defining the model and the distance measure it relies on, we provide alternatives to our model and the distance measure.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate the effectiveness of our model via a case study on real data; in addition, we design two quantitative measures, called social entropy and community score, to evaluate the quality of the discovered clusters.	Semantic Scholar
The results show that temporal-geo-social clusters have special properties and cannot be found by applying simple spatial clustering approaches and other alternatives.	Semantic Scholar
We present a novel unsupervised framework, which links continuous visual features and symbolic textual descriptions of manipulation activity videos.	Semantic Scholar
First, we extract the semantic representation of visually observed manipulations by applying a bottom-up approach to the continuous image streams.	Semantic Scholar
We then employ a rule-based reasoning to link visual and linguistic inputs.	Semantic Scholar
"The proposed framework allows robots 1) to autonomously parse, classify, and label sequentially and/or concurrently performed atomic manipulations (e.g., “cutting” or “stirring”), 2) to simultaneously categorize and identify manipulated objects without using any standard feature-based recognition techniques, and 3) to generate textual descriptions for long activities, e.g., “breakfast preparation.” We evaluated the framework using a dataset of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\text{120}$</tex-math></inline-formula> atomic manipulations and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\text{20}$</tex-math></inline-formula> long activities."

A soft two-tailed microrobot in low Reynolds number fluids does not achieve forward locomotion by identical tails regardless to its wiggling frequency.	Semantic Scholar
If the tails are nonidentical, zero forward locomotion is also observed at specific oscillation frequencies (which we refer to as the reversal frequencies), as the propulsive forces imparted to the fluid by each tail are almost equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.	Semantic Scholar
We find distinct reversal frequencies for the two-tailed microrobots based on their tail length ratio.	Semantic Scholar
At these frequencies, the microrobot achieves negligible net displacement under the influence of a periodic magnetic field.	Semantic Scholar
"This observation allows us to fabricate groups of microrobots with tail length ratio of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$1.24 \pm 0.11$</tex-math> </inline-formula>, <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$1.48 \pm 0.08$</tex-math></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$1.71 \pm 0.09$</tex-math></inline-formula>."	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate selective actuation of microrobots based on prior characterization of their reversal frequencies.	Semantic Scholar
We also implement simultaneous flagellar propulsion of two microrobots and show that they can be controlled to swim along the same direction and opposite to each other using common periodic magnetic fields.	Semantic Scholar
"In addition, independent motion control of two microrobots is achieved toward two different reference positions with average steady-state error of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">${\text{110.1}} \pm {\text{91.8}}$</tex-math></inline-formula> <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mu$</tex-math></inline-formula>m and <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX""> ${\text{146.9}} \pm {\text{105.9}}$</tex-math></inline-formula> <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mu$ </tex-math></inline-formula>m."

Smart grid (SG) is an integration of traditional power grid with advanced information and communication infrastructure for bidirectional energy flow between grid and end users.	Semantic Scholar
A huge amount of data is being generated by various smart devices deployed in SG systems.	Semantic Scholar
Such a massive data generation from various smart devices in SG systems may lead to various challenges for the networking infrastructure deployed between users and the grid.	Semantic Scholar
Hence, an efficient data transmission technique is required for providing desired QoS to the end users in this environment.	Semantic Scholar
Generally, the data generated by smart devices in SG has high dimensions in the form of multiple heterogeneous attributes, values of which are changed with time.	Semantic Scholar
The high dimensions of data may affect the performance of most of the designed solutions in this environment.	Semantic Scholar
Most of the existing schemes reported in the literature have complex operations for the data dimensionality reduction problem which may deteriorate the performance of any implemented solution for this problem.	Semantic Scholar
To address these challenges, in this paper, a tensor-based big data management scheme is proposed for dimensionality reduction problem of big data generated from various smart devices.	Semantic Scholar
In the proposed scheme, first the Frobenius norm is applied on high-order tensors (used for data representation) to minimize the reconstruction error of the reduced tensors.	Semantic Scholar
Then, an empirical probability-based control algorithm is designed to estimate an optimal path to forward the reduced data using software-defined networks for minimization of the network load and effective bandwidth utilization.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed scheme minimizes the transmission delay incurred during the movement of the dimensionally reduced data between different nodes.	Semantic Scholar
The efficacy of the proposed scheme has been evaluated using extensive simulations carried out on the data traces using ‘R’ programming and Matlab.	Semantic Scholar
The big data traces considered for evaluation consist of more than two million entries (2,075,259) collected at one minute sampling rate having hetrogenous features such as–voltage, energy, frequency, electric signals, etc.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, a comparative study for different data traces and a real SG testbed is also presented to prove the efficacy of the proposed scheme.	Semantic Scholar
The results obtained depict the effectiveness of the proposed scheme with respect to the parameters such as- network delay, accuracy, and throughput.	Semantic Scholar
Close physical human–robot interaction makes it essential to ensure human safety.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, the intrinsic safety characteristics of a robot in terms of potential human injury have to be understood well.	Semantic Scholar
Then, minimal potential harm can be made a key requirement already at an early stage of the robot design.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose the safety map concept, a map that captures human injury occurrence and robot inherent global or task-dependent safety properties in a unified manner, making it a novel, powerful, and convenient tool to quantitatively analyze the safety performance of a certain robot design.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we derive the concept and elaborate the map representations of the PUMA 560, KUKA Lightweight Robot IV+, and injury data of the human head and chest.	Semantic Scholar
For the latter, we classify and summarize the most relevant impact studies and extend existing literature overviews.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we validate our approach by deriving the safety map for a pick and place task, which allows us to assess human safety and guide the task/robot designer how to take measures in order to account for both safety and task performance requirements, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
Decomposing 3D building models into architectural elements is an essential step in understanding their 3D structure.	Semantic Scholar
Although we focus on landmark buildings, our approach generalizes to arbitrary 3D objects.	Semantic Scholar
We formulate the decomposition as a multi-label optimization that identifies individual elements of a landmark.	Semantic Scholar
This allows our system to cope with noisy, incomplete, outlier-contaminated 3D point clouds.	Semantic Scholar
We detect four types of structural cues, namely dominant mirror symmetries, rotational symmetries, shape primitives, and polylines capturing free-form shapes of the landmark not explained by symmetry.	Semantic Scholar
Our novel method combine these cues enables modeling the variability present in complex 3D models, and robustly decomposing them into architectural structural elements.	Semantic Scholar
Our proposed architectural decomposition facilitates significant 3D model compression and shape-specific modeling.	Semantic Scholar

Function approximation in online, incremental, reinforcement learning needs to deal with two fundamental problems: biased sampling and nonstationarity.	Semantic Scholar
In this kind of task, biased sampling occurs because samples are obtained from specific trajectories dictated by the dynamics of the environment and are usually concentrated in particular convergence regions, which in the long term tend to dominate the approximation in the less sampled regions.	Semantic Scholar
The nonstationarity comes from the recursive nature of the estimations typical of temporal difference methods.	Semantic Scholar
This nonstationarity has a local profile, varying not only along the learning process but also along different regions of the state space.	Semantic Scholar
We propose to deal with these problems using an estimation of the probability density of samples represented with a gaussian mixture model.	Semantic Scholar
To deal with the nonstationarity problem, we use the common approach of introducing a forgetting factor in the updating formula.	Semantic Scholar
However, instead of using the same forgetting factor for the whole domain, we make it dependent on the local density of samples, which we use to estimate the nonstationarity of the function at any given input point.	Semantic Scholar
To address the biased sampling problem, the forgetting factor applied to each mixture component is modulated according to the new information provided in the updating, rather than forgetting depending only on time, thus avoiding undesired distortions of the approximation in less sampled regions.	Semantic Scholar
In this report, we address the question of combining nonlinearities of neurons into networks for modeling increasingly varying and progressively more complex functions.	Semantic Scholar
A fundamental approach is the use of higher-level representations devised by restricted Boltzmann machines and (denoising) autoencoders.	Semantic Scholar
We present the Denoising Autoencoder Self-Organizing Map (DASOM) that integrates the latter into a hierarchically organized hybrid model where the front-end component is a grid of topologically ordered neurons.	Semantic Scholar
The approach is to interpose a layer of hidden representations between the input space and the neural lattice of the self-organizing map.	Semantic Scholar
In so doing the parameters are adjusted by the proposed unsupervised learning algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The model therefore maintains the clustering properties of its predecessor, whereas by extending and enhancing its visualization capacity enables an inclusion and an analysis of the intermediate representation space.	Semantic Scholar
A comprehensive series of experiments comprising optical recognition of text and images, and cancer type clustering and categorization is used to demonstrate DASOM's efficiency, performance and projection capabilities.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we discuss the exponential consensus problem of discrete-time multi-agent systems with non-linear dynamics via relative state-dependent impulsive protocols.	Semantic Scholar
Impulsive protocols of which the impulsive instants are dependent on the weighted relative states of any two agents are introduced for general discrete-time multi-agent systems.	Semantic Scholar
The analysis of such impulsive protocols is transformed into an investigation on reduced fixed-time impulsive protocols by constructing a map, which is achieved mainly by a derived B-equivalence method in discrete-time domain.	Semantic Scholar
Our main results indicate that the exponential consensus of the multi-agent systems via relative state-dependent impulsive protocols can be achieved if the reduced systems via fixed-time impulsive protocols can achieve exponential consensus, which need to satisfy suitable sufficient conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical simulations are presented to support the theoretical results.	Semantic Scholar
Controlling the flow and routing of data is a fundamental problem in many distributed networks, including transportation systems, integrated circuits, and the Internet.	Semantic Scholar
In the brain, synaptic plasticity rules have been discovered that regulate network activity in response to environmental inputs, which enable circuits to be stable yet flexible.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we develop a new neuro-inspired model for network flow control that depends only on modifying edge weights in an activity-dependent manner.	Semantic Scholar
We show how two fundamental plasticity rules, long-term potentiation and long-term depression, can be cast as a distributed gradient descent algorithm for regulating traffic flow in engineered networks.	Semantic Scholar
We then characterize, both by simulation and analytically, how different forms of edge-weight-update rules affect network routing efficiency and robustness.	Semantic Scholar
We find a close correspondence between certain classes of synaptic weight update rules derived experimentally in the brain and rules commonly used in engineering, suggesting common principles to both.	Semantic Scholar
A canonical problem for swarms of agents is to collectively choose one of multiple options in their environment.	Semantic Scholar
We present a novel control strategy for solving this problem—the first to be free of arithmetic computation.	Semantic Scholar
The agents do not communicate with each other nor do they store run-time information.	Semantic Scholar
They have a line-of-sight sensor that extracts one ternary digit of information from the environment.	Semantic Scholar
At every time step, they directly map this information onto constant-value motor commands.	Semantic Scholar
We evaluate the control strategy with both simulated and physical e-puck robots.	Semantic Scholar
By default, the robots are expected to choose, and move to, one of two options of equal value.	Semantic Scholar
The simulation studies show that the strategy is robust against sensory noise, scalable to large swarm sizes, and generalizes to the problems of choosing between more than two options or between unequal options.	Semantic Scholar
"The experiments—<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\text{50}$</tex-math></inline-formula> trials conducted with a group of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mathbf{20}$</tex-math></inline-formula> e-puck robots—show that the group achieves consensus in <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\text{96}\%$ </tex-math></inline-formula> of the trials."	Semantic Scholar
"Given the extremely low hardware requirements of the strategy, it opens up new possibilities for the design of swarms of robots that are small in size (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mathbf{\ll\text{10}^{-3}}$</tex-math></inline-formula> m) and large in numbers ( <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\mathbf{\gg \text{10}^3}$</tex-math></inline-formula>)."	Semantic Scholar
For many service robots, reactivity to changes in their surroundings is a must.	Semantic Scholar
However, developing software suitable for dynamic environments is difficult.	Semantic Scholar
Existing robotic middleware allows engineers to design behavior graphs by organizing communication between components.	Semantic Scholar
But because these graphs are structurally inflexible, they hardly support the development of complex reactive behavior.	Semantic Scholar
To address this limitation, we propose Playful, a software platform that applies reactive programming to the specification of robotic behavior.	Semantic Scholar
One of the key design parameters in tendon-driven continuum robots is the number of tendons and the tendon loading distribution.	Semantic Scholar
A load model is also helpful for avoiding slack in tendons that causes control inefficiency and inaccuracy.	Semantic Scholar
A quasi-static model of $n$-tendon continuum robots is derived using the Euler–Lagrange formulation.	Semantic Scholar
The model is employed to derive an analytical loading model for equidistant tendon tensions for any given beam configuration within the workspace.	Semantic Scholar
The model accounts for the bending and axial compliance of the manipulator as well as tendon compliance.	Semantic Scholar
Features of the proposed model are discussed and some of the potential applications are explained.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the proposed model, a slack avoidance algorithm with analytical formulation is developed to dynamically optimize the tendon loads while preventing slack in tendons for a given configuration.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed model is experimentally validated in a multitendon continuum robot system for four case studies of three- to six-tendon arrangements in open-loop control architecture.	Semantic Scholar
A stereo vision-based three-dimensional reconstruction system measures the beam configuration and properties for each of the three- to six-tendon continuum robots.	Semantic Scholar
The effect of number of tendons on the tension loads in  $n$-tendon continuum robots is studied.	Semantic Scholar
A quantitative dimensionless relationship between the number of tendons, the maximum tendon loads, and the bending angles is developed that may be used as a design tool for tradeoff among the complexity and required force and size.	Semantic Scholar
Human brains seem to represent categories of objects and actions as locations in a continuous semantic space across the cortical surface that reflects the similarity among categories.	Semantic Scholar
This vision of the semantic organization of information in the brain, suggested by recent experimental findings, is in harmony with the well-known topographically organized somatotopic, retinotopic, and tonotopic maps in the cerebral cortex.	Semantic Scholar
Here we show that these topographies can be operationally represented with context-dependent associative memories.	Semantic Scholar
In these models, the input vectors and, eventually also, the associated output vectors are multiplied by context vectors via the Kronecker tensor product, which allows a spatial organization of memories.	Semantic Scholar
Input and output tensor contexts localize matrices of semantic categories into a neural layer or slice and, at the same time, direct the flow of information arriving at the layer to a specific address, and then forward the output information toward the corresponding targets.	Semantic Scholar
Given a neural topographic pattern, the tensor representation will place a set of associative matrix memories within a topographic regionalized host matrix in such way that they reproduce the empirical pattern of patches in the actual neural layer.	Semantic Scholar
Progressive approximations to this goal are accomplished by avoiding excessive overlap of memories or the existence of empty regions within the host matrix.	Semantic Scholar
There are an increasing number of applications that require the end-effector of a robotic manipulator to be compliant in response to the intended force exerted by a human operator.	Semantic Scholar
In physical human–robot interaction, the stability and compliance are often affected in the presence of both human and an environment, especially during the transition from noncontact to contact.	Semantic Scholar
Unlike previous works, the physical human–robot interaction in this letter takes into consideration of the interaction of the human, robot, and a moving environment.	Semantic Scholar
To achieve this, this letter proposes a variable admittance control strategy with an adaptive controller to produce a time-varying stiffness interacting with the human and a moving environment simultaneously.	Semantic Scholar
The passivity of the system is guaranteed for time-varying admittance with human interaction coupled with a moving environment.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the capability of the controller.	Semantic Scholar
Resolution proof systems for quantified Boolean formulas (QBFs) provide a formal model for studying the limitations of state-of-the-art search-based QBF solvers that use these systems to generate proofs.	Semantic Scholar
We study a combination of two proof systems supported by the solver DepQBF: Q-resolution with generalized universal reduction according to a dependency scheme and long distance Q-resolution.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the resulting proof system—which we call long-distance Q(D)-resolution—is sound for the reflexive resolution-path dependency scheme.	Semantic Scholar
In fact, we prove that it admits strategy extraction in polynomial time.	Semantic Scholar
This comes as an application of a general result, by which we identify a whole class of dependency schemes for which long-distance Q(D)-resolution admits polynomial-time strategy extraction.	Semantic Scholar
As a special case, we obtain soundness and polynomial-time strategy extraction for long distance Q(D)-resolution with the standard dependency scheme.	Semantic Scholar
We further show that search-based QBF solvers using a dependency scheme D and learning with long-distance Q-resolution generate long-distance Q(D)-resolution proofs.	Semantic Scholar
The above soundness results thus translate to partial soundness results for such solvers: they declare an input QBF to be false only if it is indeed false.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we report on experiments with a configuration of DepQBF that uses the standard dependency scheme and learning based on long-distance Q-resolution.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, a manipulator is proposed for safe human–robot interaction at high speed.	Semantic Scholar
The manipulator has both low mass and inertia and high stiffness and strength.	Semantic Scholar
It is basically a cable-driven manipulator; nevertheless, by using a unique lightweight tension-amplification mechanism, the manipulator retains high stiffness and strength.	Semantic Scholar
The joint stiffness, which is strongly related to the motion control performance, is amplified by the quadratic order.	Semantic Scholar
Both 1-degree of freedom (DOF) and 3-DOF joint mechanisms using the tension-amplification mechanism are presented and combined to develop a 7-DOF anthropomorphic manipulator named LIMS.	Semantic Scholar
The mass and inertia beyond the shoulder were 2.24 kg and 0.599 kg·m2, respectively, which are lower than those of a human.	Semantic Scholar
The stiffness of the developed elbow joint was 1410 N·m/rad, which is approximately seven times higher than that of a human.	Semantic Scholar
Considering the ratio of stiffness to inertia, the manipulator is expected to show a control performance that is comparable to those of conventional industrial manipulators.	Semantic Scholar
Comprehensive experiments, including joint stiffness tests and high-speed interaction tests, were conducted to verify the feasibility of the developed manipulator.	Semantic Scholar
In humanoids and other redundant robots interacting with the environment, one can often choose between different configurations and control parameters to achieve a given task.	Semantic Scholar
A classic tool to describe specifications of the desired force/displacement behavior in such problems is the stiffness ellipsoid, whose geometry is affected by the choice of parameters in both joint control and redundancy resolution—namely, gains and angles.	Semantic Scholar
As is well known, impedance control techniques can regulate gains to realize any desired shape of the Cartesian stiffness ellipsoid at the end-effector, so that robot geometry selection could appear secondary.	Semantic Scholar
However, humans do not use this possibility: To control the stiffness of our arms, we predominantly use arm configurations.	Semantic Scholar
Why is that, and does it makes sense to do the same in robots?	Semantic Scholar
To understand this discrepancy, we provide a more complete analysis of the task-space force/deformation behavior of compliant redundant arms to illustrate why the arm geometry plays a dominant role in interaction capabilities of robots.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce the notion of allowable Cartesian force/displacement (“stiffness feasibility”) regions (SFR) for compliant robots with given torque boundaries.	Semantic Scholar
We show that different robot configurations modify such regions and explore the role of robot geometry in achieving an appropriate SFR for the task at hand.	Semantic Scholar
The novel concepts and definitions are first illustrated in simulations.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results are then provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed Cartesian force and stiffness control.	Semantic Scholar
Video image recognition has been extensively studied with rapid progress recently.	Semantic Scholar
However, most methods focus on short-term rather than long-term (contextual) video recognition.	Semantic Scholar
Convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) provide robust spatio-temporal information processing capabilities for contextual video recognition, but require extensive computation that slows down training.	Semantic Scholar
"Inspired by normalization and detrending methods, in this paper we propose ""adaptive detrending"" (AD) for temporal normalization in order to accelerate the training of ConvRNNs, especially of convolutional gated recurrent unit (ConvGRU)."	Semantic Scholar
For each neuron in a recurrent neural network (RNN), AD identifies the trending change within a sequence and subtracts it, removing the internal covariate shift.	Semantic Scholar
In experiments testing for contextual video recognition with ConvGRU, results show that (1) ConvGRU clearly outperforms feed-forward neural networks, (2) AD consistently and significantly accelerates training and improves generalization, (3) performance is further improved when AD is coupled with other normalization methods, and most importantly, (4) the more long-term contextual information is required, the more AD outperforms existing methods.	Semantic Scholar
This paper is concerned with the fixed-time synchronization for a class of complex-valued neural networks in the presence of discontinuous activation functions and parameter uncertainties.	Semantic Scholar
Fixed-time synchronization not only claims that the considered master-slave system realizes synchronization within a finite time segment, but also requires a uniform upper bound for such time intervals for all initial synchronization errors.	Semantic Scholar
To accomplish the target of fixed-time synchronization, a novel feedback control procedure is designed for the slave neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
By means of the Filippov discontinuity theories and Lyapunov stability theories, some sufficient conditions are established for the selection of control parameters to guarantee synchronization within a fixed time, while an upper bound of the settling time is acquired as well, which allows to be modulated to predefined values independently on initial conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, criteria of modified controller for assurance of fixed-time anti-synchronization are also derived for the same system.	Semantic Scholar
An example is included to illustrate the proposed methodologies.	Semantic Scholar
To solve dynamic Sylvester equation in the presence of additive noises, a novel recurrent neural network (NRNN) with finite-time convergence and excellent robustness is proposed and analyzed in this paper.	Semantic Scholar
As compared with the design process of Zhang neural network (ZNN), the proposed NRNN is based on an ingenious integral design formula activated by nonlinear functions, which are able to expedite the convergence speed and suppress unknown additive noises during the solving process of dynamic Sylvester equation.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the global stability, finite-time convergence and denoising property of the NRNN model are theoretically proved.	Semantic Scholar
The upper bound of the finite convergence time for the NRNN model is also estimated in theory.	Semantic Scholar
Simulative results further verify the efficiency of the NRNN model, as well as its superior robust and finite-time performance to the conventional ZNN model for dynamic Sylvester equation in front of additive noises.	Semantic Scholar
At last, the proposed design method for establishing the NRNN model is successfully applied to kinematical control of robotic manipulator in front of additive noises.	Semantic Scholar
A suitable feature representation can faithfully preserve the intrinsic structure of data.	Semantic Scholar
However, traditional dimensionality reduction (DR) methods commonly use the original input features to define the intrinsic structure, which makes the estimated intrinsic structure unreliable since redundant or noisy features may exist in the original input features.	Semantic Scholar
Thus a dilemma is that (1) one needs the most suitable feature representation to define the intrinsic structure of data and (2) one should use the proper intrinsic structure of data to perform feature extraction.	Semantic Scholar
To address the problem, in this paper we propose a unified learning framework to simultaneously obtain the optimal feature representation and intrinsic structure of data.	Semantic Scholar
The structure is learned from the results of feature learning, and the features are learned to preserve the refined structure of data.	Semantic Scholar
By leveraging the interactions between the process of determining the most suitable feature representation and intrinsic structure of data, we can capture accurate structure and obtain the optimal feature representation of data.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in DR and subspace clustering.	Semantic Scholar
"The code of the proposed method is available at ""http://www.yongxu.org/lunwen.html ""."	Semantic Scholar
Object detection methods usually represent objects through rectangular bounding boxes from which they extract features, regardless of their actual shapes.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we apply deformations to regions in order to learn representations better fitted to objects.	Semantic Scholar
We introduce DP-FCN, a deep model implementing this idea by learning to align parts to discriminative elements of objects in a latent way, i.e.	Semantic Scholar
without part annotation.	Semantic Scholar
This approach has two main assets: it builds invariance to local transformations, thus improving recognition, and brings geometric information to describe objects more finely, leading to a more accurate localization.	Semantic Scholar
We further develop both features in a new model named DP-FCN2.0 by explicitly learning interactions between parts.	Semantic Scholar
Alignment is done with an in-network joint optimization of all parts based on a CRF with custom potentials, and deformations are influencing localization through a bilinear product.	Semantic Scholar
We validate our models on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets and show significant gains.	Semantic Scholar
DP-FCN2.0 achieves state-of-the-art results of 83.3 and 81.2% on VOC 2007 and 2012 with VOC data only.	Semantic Scholar
We discuss an extension of the basic principles underlying the human haptic just noticeable difference (JND) in perceiving a manipulator's mechanical properties from force feedback.	Semantic Scholar
Two cases are studied: first, the JND in perceiving the stiffness of manipulators with various masses and, second, the JND in perceiving the damping of a combined mass–spring–damper system with varying stiffness and mass.	Semantic Scholar
The extended JND laws are obtained through mapping psychophysical findings to JND formulations based on frequency response functions.	Semantic Scholar
We first present two human-factor experiments in which subjects discriminated between different levels of manipulator stiffness/damping while moving the manipulator with a prescribed sinusoidal deflection.	Semantic Scholar
For the two testing cases, both JNDs violate Weber's law: Due to the increases in mass, the normalized stiffness JND (the Weber fraction) decreases as the reference stiffness level increases; the damping JND for a constant reference damping increases with higher combined responses of stiffness and mass.	Semantic Scholar
On the basis of weighting the frequency response magnitude of mechanical properties, we performed model identification that fit the experimental observations and extended the JND laws for the two testing cases.	Semantic Scholar
Our extended JND laws indicate that, first, the stiffness and mass affect the stiffness JND in the same way, the stiffness JND is a fixed proportion of the combined frequency response of stiffness and mass, and, second, the frequency response magnitude of the damping JND is a fixed proportion of the frequency response magnitude of the combined system (the mass–spring–damper system).

A primary goal of many neuroimaging studies that use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is to deduce the structure-function relationships in the human brain using data from the three major neuro-MRI modalities: high-resolution anatomical, diffusion tensor imaging, and functional MRI.	Semantic Scholar
To date, the general procedure for analyzing these data is to combine the results derived independently from each of these modalities.	Semantic Scholar
In this article, we develop a new theoretical and computational approach for combining these different MRI modalities into a powerful and versatile framework that combines our recently developed methods for morphological shape analysis and segmentation, simultaneous local diffusion estimation and global tractography, and nonlinear and nongaussian spatial-temporal activation pattern classification and ranking, as well as our fast and accurate approach for nonlinear registration between modalities.	Semantic Scholar
This joint analysis method is capable of extracting new levels of information that is not achievable from any of those single modalities alone.	Semantic Scholar
A theoretical probabilistic framework based on a reformulation of prior information and available interdependencies between modalities through a joint coupling matrix and an efficient computational implementation allows construction of quantitative functional, structural, and effective brain connectivity modes and parcellation.	Semantic Scholar
This new method provides an overall increase of resolution, accuracy, level of detail, and information content and has the potential to be instrumental in the clinical adaptation of neuro-MRI modalities, which, when jointly analyzed, provide a more comprehensive view of a subject’s structure-function relations, while the current standard, wherein single-modality methods are analyzed separately, leaves a critical gap in an integrated view of a subject’s neuorphysiological state.	Semantic Scholar
As one example of this increased sensitivity, we demonstrate that the jointly estimated structural and functional dependencies of mode power follow the same power law decay with the same exponent.	Semantic Scholar
Neural systems are inherently noisy.	Semantic Scholar
One well-studied example of a noise reduction mechanism in the brain is the population code, where representing a variable with multiple neurons allows the encoded variable to be recovered with fewer errors.	Semantic Scholar
Studies have assumed ideal observer models for decoding population codes, and the manner in which information in the neural population can be retrieved remains elusive.	Semantic Scholar
This letter addresses a mechanism by which realistic neural circuits can recover encoded variables.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, the decoding problem of recovering a spatial location from populations of grid cells is studied using belief propagation.	Semantic Scholar
We extend the belief propagation decoding algorithm in two aspects.	Semantic Scholar
First, beliefs are approximated rather than being calculated exactly.	Semantic Scholar
Second, decoding noises are introduced into the decoding circuits.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical simulations demonstrate that beliefs can be effectively approximated by combining polynomial nonlinearities with divisive normalization.	Semantic Scholar
This approximate belief propagation algorithm is tolerant to decoding noises.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, this letter presents a realistic model for decoding neural population codes and investigates fault-tolerant information retrieval mechanisms in the brain.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a modification of the cost function of the Hopfield model whose salient features shine in its Taylor expansion and result in more than pairwise interactions with alternate signs, suggesting a unified framework for handling both with deep learning and network pruning.	Semantic Scholar
In our analysis, we heavily rely on the Hamilton-Jacobi correspondence relating the statistical model with a mechanical system.	Semantic Scholar
In this picture, our model is nothing but the relativistic extension of the original Hopfield model (whose cost function is a quadratic form in the Mattis magnetization and mimics the non-relativistic counterpart, the so-called classical limit).	Semantic Scholar
We focus on the low-storage regime and solve the model analytically by taking advantage of the mechanical analogy, thus obtaining a complete characterization of the free energy and the associated self-consistency equations in the thermodynamic limit.	Semantic Scholar
Further, on the numerical side, we test the performances of our proposal with extensive Monte Carlo simulations, showing that the stability of spurious states (limiting the capabilities of the standard Hebbian construction) is sensibly reduced due to presence of unlearning contributions that prune them massively.	Semantic Scholar
Behavioral plausibility is one of the major aims of crowd simulation research.	Semantic Scholar
We present a novel approach that simulates communication between the agents and assess its influence on overall crowd behavior.	Semantic Scholar
Our formulation uses a communication model that tends to simulate human-like communication capability.	Semantic Scholar
The underlying formulation is based on a message structure that corresponds to a simplified version of Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents Agent Communication Language Message Structure Specification.	Semantic Scholar
Our algorithm distinguishes between low- and high-level communication tasks so that ACMICS can be easily extended and employed in new simulation scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
We highlight the performance of our communication model on different crowd simulation scenarios.	Semantic Scholar
We also extend our approach to model evacuation behavior in unknown environments.	Semantic Scholar
Overall, our communication model has a small runtime overhead and can be used for interactive simulation with tens or hundreds of agents.	Semantic Scholar
The bipartite graph is a ubiquitous data structure that can model the relationship between two entity types: for instance, users and items, queries and webpages.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we study the problem of ranking vertices of a bipartite graph, based on the graph's link structure as well as prior information about vertices (which we term a query vector).	Semantic Scholar
We present a new solution, BiRank, which iteratively assigns scores to vertices and finally converges to a unique stationary ranking.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to the traditional random walk-based methods, BiRank iterates towards optimizing a regularization function, which smooths the graph under the guidance of the query vector.	Semantic Scholar
Importantly, we establish how BiRank relates to the Bayesian methodology, enabling the future extension in a probabilistic way.	Semantic Scholar
To show the rationale and extendability of the ranking methodology, we further extend it to rank for the more generic n-partite graphs.	Semantic Scholar
BiRank's generic modeling of both the graph structure and vertex features enables it to model various ranking hypotheses flexibly.	Semantic Scholar
To illustrate its functionality, we apply the BiRank and TriRank (ranking for tripartite graphs) algorithms to two real-world applications: a general ranking scenario that predicts the future popularity of items, and a personalized ranking scenario that recommends items of interest to users.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate BiRank's soundness (fast convergence), efficiency (linear in the number of graph edges), and effectiveness (achieving state-of-the-art in the two real-world tasks).	Semantic Scholar
Wearable glasses are on the rising edge of development with great user popularity.	Semantic Scholar
However, user data stored on these devices bring privacy risks to the owner.	Semantic Scholar
To better protect the owner's privacy, a continuous authentication system is needed.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a continuous and noninvasive authentication system for wearable glasses, named GlassGuard.	Semantic Scholar
GlassGuard discriminates the owner and an impostor with behavioral biometrics from six types of touch gestures (single-tap, swipe forward, swipe backward, swipe down, two-finger swipe forward, and two-finger swipe backward) and voice commands, which are all available during normal user interactions.	Semantic Scholar
With data collected from 32 users on Google Glass, we show that GlassGuard achieves 99% detection rate and 0.5% false alarm rate after 3.5 user events on average when all types of user events are available with equal probability.	Semantic Scholar
Under five typical usage scenarios, the system has a detection rate above 93% and a false alarm rate below 3% after less than five user events.	Semantic Scholar
This study shows how learning relations between affordances facilitates performing robotic tasks.	Semantic Scholar
Tasks usually involve multiple affordances.	Semantic Scholar
For example, for pounding a nail with a hammer, grasp-ability and pound-ability of the hammer are important for performing the pounding task successfully.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, these affordances are associated with parts of the hammer.	Semantic Scholar
In the pounding task, the head of the hammer affords pounding and the handle of the hammer affords grasping.	Semantic Scholar
We propose an Red Green Blue-Depth (RGB-D) part-based approach for performing tasks.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, affordances are linked to object parts.	Semantic Scholar
We learn affordances associated with manipulation and execution of the tasks, i.e., grasping for manipulation and pounding for execution in the task of pounding a nail.	Semantic Scholar
Since affordances are associated with parts, tasks can be executed directly on the objects.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach is evaluated in six different robotic tasks on a real robot.	Semantic Scholar
We obtained an average of 65% task detection rate superior to the baseline methods and an average of 77% task success rate.	Semantic Scholar

This paper presents a model-based strategy for 3D deformable object grasping using a multi-fingered robotic hand.	Semantic Scholar
The developed contact model is based on two force components (normal force and tangential friction force, including slipping and sticking effects) and uses a non-linear mass-spring system to describe the object deformations due the mechanical load applied by the fingers of the robotic hand.	Semantic Scholar
The object-finger interaction is simulated in order to compute the required contact forces and deformations to robustly grasp objects with large deformations.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach is able to achieve this by using a non-linear model that outperforms current techniques that are limited to using linear models.	Semantic Scholar
After the contact forces computed by the simulation of the contact model guarantee the equilibrium of the grasp, they will be used as set-points for forcecontrolling the closing of the real fingers, and thus, the proposed grasping strategy is implemented.	Semantic Scholar
Two different objects (cube and sphere) made from two soft materials (foam and rubber) are tested in order to verify that the proposed model can represent their non-linear deformations and that the proposed grasp strategy can implement a robust grasp of them with a multi-fingered robotic hand equipped with tactile sensors.	Semantic Scholar
Thereby, both the grasping strategy and the proposed contact model are validated experimentally.	Semantic Scholar

This letter introduces a lightweight hexapod robot, Giacometti robot, made with long and narrow legs following the Alberto Giacometti's sculpture conception.	Semantic Scholar
The goal is achieved by, first, using multiple links with thin and soft McKibben actuators, and second, choosing a leg design which is narrow in comparison to its body's length and height, unlike conventional robot design.	Semantic Scholar
By such design characteristic, the leg will exhibit elastic deformations due to the low stiffness property of the thin link structure.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we model the leg structure and conduct the deflection analysis to confirm the capability of the leg to perform walking motion.	Semantic Scholar
The high force to weight ratio characteristics of the actuator provided the ability to drive the system, as shown by a static model and further validated experimentally.	Semantic Scholar
To compensate for the high elastic structural flexibility of the legs, two walking gaits namely customized Wave gait and Giacometti gait were introduced.	Semantic Scholar
The robot could walk successfully with both gaits at maximum speed of 0.005 and 0.05 m/s, respectively.	Semantic Scholar
It is envisaged that the lightweight Giacometti robot design can be very useful in legged robotic exploration.	Semantic Scholar
The NavGuide is a novel electronic device to assist visually impaired people with obstacle free path-finding.	Semantic Scholar
The highlight of the NavGuide system is that it provides simplified information on the surrounding environment and deduces priority information without causing information overload.	Semantic Scholar
The priority information is provided to the user through vibration and audio feedback mechanisms.	Semantic Scholar
The proof-of-concept device consists of a low power embedded system with ultrasonic sensors, vibration motors, and a battery.	Semantic Scholar
To test the effectiveness of the NavGuide system in daily-life mobility of visually impaired people, we performed an evaluation using 70 blind people of the “school & home for the blind.” All evaluations were performed in controlled, real-world test environments with the NavGuide and traditional white cane.	Semantic Scholar
The evaluation results show that NavGuide is a useful aid in the detection of obstacles, wet floors, and ascending staircases and its performance is better than that of a white cane.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we extend our previous work on the Enhanced Fuzzy Min-Max (EFMM) neural network by introducing a new hyperbox selection rule and a pruning strategy to reduce network complexity and improve classification performance.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, a new k-nearest hyperbox expansion rule (for selection of a new winning hyperbox) is first introduced to reduce the network complexity by avoiding the creation of too many small hyperboxes within the vicinity of the winning hyperbox.	Semantic Scholar
A pruning strategy is then deployed to further reduce the network complexity in the presence of noisy data.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness of the proposed network is evaluated using a number of benchmark data sets.	Semantic Scholar
The results compare favorably with those from other related models.	Semantic Scholar
The findings indicate that the newly introduced hyperbox winner selection rule coupled with the pruning strategy are useful for undertaking pattern classification problems.	Semantic Scholar
More and more applications have come with large data sets in the past decade.	Semantic Scholar
However, existing algorithms cannot guarantee to scale well on large data.	Semantic Scholar
Averaged n-Dependence Estimators (AnDE) allows for flexible learning from out-of-core data, by varying the value of n (number of super parents).	Semantic Scholar
Hence, AnDE is especially appropriate for large data learning.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a sample-based attribute selection technique for AnDE.	Semantic Scholar
It needs one more pass through the training data, in which a multitude of approximate AnDE models are built and efficiently assessed by leave-one-out cross validation.	Semantic Scholar
The use of a sample reduces the training time.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on 15 large data sets demonstrate that the proposed technique significantly reduces AnDE's error at the cost of a modest increase in training time.	Semantic Scholar
This efficient and scalable out-of-core approach delivers superior or comparable performance to typical in-core Bayesian network classifiers.	Semantic Scholar
Colorectal cancer is a common type of cancer.	Semantic Scholar
Due to the alarming incidence and mortality rate, it has received increasing attention on early detection and treatment.	Semantic Scholar
Colorectal polyps form and grow at initial stages of most colorectal cancer cases.	Semantic Scholar
Due to rather stringent medical resource availability and low screening compliance rate, it is more desirable in China than industrialized countries to characterize the relations between colorectal polyp occurrence and various potential determinants, including basic health information, comorbidities, and lifestyle conditions.	Semantic Scholar
Subsequently, one can better predict polyp incidence for each individual.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we report a data-driven modeling study to improve binary classification of colorectal polyp occurrence.	Semantic Scholar
We apply several machine-learning methods, particularly random forests, for physical examination and screening colonoscopy results of a Chinese cohort, to build the classifiers.	Semantic Scholar
Our results suggest improved prediction performance with the random forests model.	Semantic Scholar
Our study also provides evidence to support the general speculation that emotional status may be an influential risk factor to early colorectal cancer growth in China.	Semantic Scholar
The development of central and peripheral neural system depends in part on the emergence of the correct functional connectivity in its input and output pathways.	Semantic Scholar
Now it is generally accepted that molecular factors guide neurons to establish a primary scaffold that undergoes activity-dependent refinement for building a fully functional circuit.	Semantic Scholar
However, a number of experimental results obtained recently shows that the neuronal electrical activity plays an important role in the establishing of initial interneuronal connections.	Semantic Scholar
Nevertheless, these processes are rather difficult to study experimentally, due to the absence of theoretical description and quantitative parameters for estimation of the neuronal activity influence on growth in neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
In this work we propose a general framework for a theoretical description of the activity-dependent neural network growth.	Semantic Scholar
The theoretical description incorporates a closed-loop growth model in which the neural activity can affect neurite outgrowth, which in turn can affect neural activity.	Semantic Scholar
We carried out the detailed quantitative analysis of spatiotemporal activity patterns and studied the relationship between individual cells and the network as a whole to explore the relationship between developing connectivity and activity patterns.	Semantic Scholar
The model, developed in this work will allow us to develop new experimental techniques for studying and quantifying the influence of the neuronal activity on growth processes in neural networks and may lead to a novel techniques for constructing large-scale neural networks by self-organization.

Transfer learning techniques have been broadly applied in applications where labeled data in a target domain are difficult to obtain while a lot of labeled data are available in related source domains.	Semantic Scholar
In practice, there can be multiple source domains that are related to the target domain, and how to combine them is still an open problem.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we seek to leverage labeled data from multiple source domains to enhance classification performance in a target domain where the target data are received in an online fashion.	Semantic Scholar
This problem is known as the online transfer learning problem.	Semantic Scholar
To achieve this, we propose novel online transfer learning paradigms in which the source and target domains are leveraged adaptively.	Semantic Scholar
We consider two different problem settings: homogeneous transfer learning and heterogeneous transfer learning.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed methods work in an online manner, where the weights of the source domains are adjusted dynamically.	Semantic Scholar
We provide the mistake bounds of the proposed methods and perform comprehensive experiments on real-world data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.	Semantic Scholar
RDF question/answering (Q/A) allows users to ask questions in natural languages over a knowledge base represented by RDF.	Semantic Scholar
To answer a natural language question, the existing work takes a two-stage approach: question understanding and query evaluation.	Semantic Scholar
Their focus is on question understanding to deal with the disambiguation of the natural language phrases.	Semantic Scholar
The most common technique is the joint disambiguation, which has the exponential search space.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to answer natural language questions over RDF repository (RDF Q/A) from a graph data-driven perspective.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a semantic query graph to model the query intention in the natural language question in a structural way, based on which, RDF Q/A is reduced to subgraph matching problem.	Semantic Scholar
More importantly, we resolve the ambiguity of natural language questions at the time when matches of query are found.	Semantic Scholar
The cost of disambiguation is saved if there are no matching found.	Semantic Scholar
More specifically, we propose two different frameworks to build the semantic query graph, one is relation (edge)-first and the other one is node-first.	Semantic Scholar
We compare our method with some state-of-the-art RDF Q/A systems in the benchmark dataset.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments confirm that our method not only improves the precision but also speeds up query performance greatly.	Semantic Scholar

Technically, it combines global caching with checking fulfillment of eventualities and dealing with nominals.	Semantic Scholar
Our procedure contains enough details for direct implementation and has been implemented for the TGC2 (Tableaux with Global Caching) system.	Semantic Scholar
As HPDL can be used as a description logic for representing and reasoning about terminological knowledge, our procedure is useful for practical applications.	Semantic Scholar

Its objective is to provide a significant portion of the forces necessary to carry out the physical task, thereby reducing the compressive loads on the lumbar spine and the associated risk of injury.	Semantic Scholar
The design rationale for a parallel-elastic actuator (PEA) is proposed to match the asymmetrical torque requirements associated with the target task.	Semantic Scholar
The parallel spring relaxes the maximum motor torque requirements, with substantial effects on the resulting torque-control performance.	Semantic Scholar
A formal analysis and experimental evaluation is presented with the goal of documenting the improvement in performance.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, the proposed PEA is compared with a more traditional configuration without the parallel spring.	Semantic Scholar
The formal analysis and experimental results highlight the importance of the motor inertia reflected through the gearbox and illustrate the improvements in the proposed measures of torque-control performance.	Semantic Scholar
Identification of anonymous identical users of cross-platforms refers to the recognition of the accounts belonging to the same individual among multiple Social Network (SN) platforms.	Semantic Scholar
Evidently, cross-platform exploration may help solve many problems in social computing, in both theory and practice.	Semantic Scholar
However, it is still an intractable problem due to the fragmentation, inconsistency, and disruption of the accessible information among SNs.	Semantic Scholar
Different from the efforts implemented on user profiles and users’ content, many studies have noticed the accessibility and reliability of network structure in most of the SNs for addressing this issue.	Semantic Scholar
Although substantial achievements have been made, most of the current network structure-based solutions, requiring prior knowledge of some given identified users, are supervised or semi-supervised.	Semantic Scholar
It is laborious to label the prior knowledge manually in some scenarios where prior knowledge is hard to obtain.	Semantic Scholar
Noticing that friend relationships are reliable and consistent in different SNs, we proposed an unsupervised scheme, termed Friend Relationship-based User Identification algorithm without Prior knowledge (FRUI-P).	Semantic Scholar
The FRUI-P first extracts the friend feature of each user in an SN into friend feature vector, and then calculates the similarities of all the candidate identical users between two SNs.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, a one-to-one map scheme is developed to identify the users based on the similarities.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, FRUI-P is proved to be efficient theoretically.	Semantic Scholar
Results of extensive experiments demonstrated that FRUI-P performs much better than current state-of-art network structure-based algorithm without prior knowledge.	Semantic Scholar
Due to its high precision, FRUI-P can additionally be utilized to generate prior knowledge for supervised and semi-supervised schemes.	Semantic Scholar
In applications, the unsupervised anonymous identical user identification method accommodates more scenarios where the seed users are unobtainable.	Semantic Scholar
In recent years, unsupervised two-dimensional (2D) dimensionality reduction methods for unlabeled large-scale data have made progress.	Semantic Scholar
However, performance of these degrades when the learning of similarity matrix is at the beginning of the dimensionality reduction process.	Semantic Scholar
A similarity matrix is used to reveal the underlying geometry structure of data in unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods.	Semantic Scholar
Because of noise data, it is difficult to learn the optimal similarity matrix.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a new dimensionality reduction model for 2D image matrices: unsupervised 2D dimensionality reduction with adaptive structure learning (DRASL).	Semantic Scholar
Instead of using a predetermined similarity matrix to characterize the underlying geometry structure of the original 2D image space, our proposed approach involves the learning of a similarity matrix in the procedure of dimensionality reduction.	Semantic Scholar
To realize a desirable neighbors assignment after dimensionality reduction, we add a constraint to our model such that there are exact connected components in the final subspace.	Semantic Scholar
To accomplish these goals, we propose a unified objective function to integrate dimensionality reduction, the learning of the similarity matrix, and the adaptive learning of neighbors assignment into it.	Semantic Scholar
An iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the objective function.	Semantic Scholar
We compare the proposed method with several 2D unsupervised dimensionality methods.	Semantic Scholar
K-means is used to evaluate the clustering performance.	Semantic Scholar
We conduct extensive experiments on Coil20, AT&T, FERET, USPS, and Yale data sets to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
Given a large transactional database, correlation computing/association analysis aims at efficiently finding strongly correlated items.	Semantic Scholar
For traditional association analysis, relationships among variables are usually measured at a global level.	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we investigate confounding factors that can help to capture abnormal correlation behaviors at a local level.	Semantic Scholar
Indeed, many real-world phenomena are localized to specific markets or subpopulations.	Semantic Scholar
Such local relationships may not be visible or may be miscalculated when collectively analyzing the entire data.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, confounding effects that change the direction of correlation are a most severe problem because the global correlations alone leads to errant conclusions.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we propose CONFOUND, an efficient algorithm to identify paradoxical correlation patterns (i.e., where controlling for a third item changes the direction of association for strongly correlated pairs) using effective pruning strategies.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we also provide an enhanced version of this algorithm, called CONFOUND+, which substantially speeds up the confounder search step.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, experimental results showed that our proposed CONFOUND and CONFOUND+ algorithms can effectively identify confounders and the computational performance is orders of magnitude faster than benchmark methods.	Semantic Scholar

Secondly, an impulsive control law is constructed and utilized to guarantee master-slave exponential synchronization of the neural networks.	Semantic Scholar
Thirdly, the master-slave synchronization problems are transformed into the stability problems of the master-slave error system.	Semantic Scholar
By employing linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique and constructing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, some sufficient synchronization criteria are derived.	Semantic Scholar

Learning an appropriate distance metric plays a substantial role in the success of many learning machines.	Semantic Scholar
Conventional metric learning algorithms have limited utility when the training and test samples are drawn from related but different domains (i.e., source domain and target domain).	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose two novel metric learning algorithms for domain adaptation in an information-theoretic setting, allowing for discriminating power transfer and standard learning machine propagation across two domains.	Semantic Scholar
In the first one, a cross-domain Mahalanobis distance is learned by combining three goals: reducing the distribution difference between different domains, preserving the geometry of target domain data, and aligning the geometry of source domain data with label information.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, we devote our efforts to solving complex domain adaptation problems and go beyond linear cross-domain metric learning by extending the first method to a multiple kernel learning framework.	Semantic Scholar
A convex combination of multiple kernels and a linear transformation are adaptively learned in a single optimization, which greatly benefits the exploration of prior knowledge and the description of data characteristics.	Semantic Scholar
Comprehensive experiments in three real-world applications (face recognition, text classification, and object categorization) verify that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art metric learning and domain adaptation methods.	Semantic Scholar
Modeling of the motion of a skid-steered robot is challenging since slippage and skidding is inherent to this type of platform and it requires high torques to perform curvilinear motion.	Semantic Scholar
If the ground-robot interaction and torque requirements are not captured properly, motion planners will sometimes generate trajectories that are not achievable by the robot.	Semantic Scholar
Important motion planning applications that rely heavily in these models, include energy efficient and momentum based planning.	Semantic Scholar
However, these models change as the terrain surface varies.	Semantic Scholar
To cope with this issue, this paper presents a methodology to perform online learning of such models.	Semantic Scholar
It combines detailed slip and terramechanic-based dynamic models of wheel-terrain interaction with online learning via Extended Kalman filtering (to update the kinematic model) and an efficient neural network formulation (to update the dynamic model).	Semantic Scholar

Location information of Web pages plays an important role in location-sensitive tasks such as Web search ranking for location-sensitive queries.	Semantic Scholar
However, such information is usually ambiguous, incomplete, or even missing, which raises the problem of location prediction for Web pages.	Semantic Scholar
Meanwhile, Web pages are massive and often noisy, which pose challenges to the majority of existing algorithms for location prediction.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a novel and scalable location prediction framework for Web pages based on the query-URL click graph.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we introduce a concept of term location vectors to capture location distributions for all terms and develop an automatic approach to learn the importance of each term location vector for location prediction.	Semantic Scholar
Empirical results on a large URL set demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the location prediction accuracy comparing with various representative baselines.	Semantic Scholar
We further provide a principled way to incorporate the proposed framework into the search ranking task and experimental results on a commercial search engine show that the proposed method remarkably boosts the ranking performance for location-sensitive queries.	Semantic Scholar

The objective of this work is to improve the efficacy, acceptance, adaptability, and overall performance of HMS and human–system interaction (HSI) applications using a context-based approach.	Semantic Scholar
Our hypothesis is that we can enhance current interaction functionalities by integrating context and interaction information models into a decision-making component that behaves as a supervision process for controlling interaction.	Semantic Scholar
In HSI, we aim to define a general human model that may lead to principles and algorithms, allowing more natural and effective interaction between humans and artificial agents.	Semantic Scholar
The approach was implemented and tested targeting application in the domain of active and assisted living.	Semantic Scholar
The challenge of user acceptance is of vital importance for future solutions and is still one of the major reasons for reluctance to adopt cyber-physical systems in this domain.	Semantic Scholar
When manipulating an object with multiple effectors such as in multidigit grasping or multiagent collaboration, forces and torques (i.e., wrench) applied to the object at different contact points generally do not fully contribute to the resultant object wrench, but partly compensate each other.	Semantic Scholar
The current literature, however, lacks a physically plausible decomposition of the applied wrench into its manipulation and internal components.	Semantic Scholar
We formulate the wrench decomposition as a convex optimization problem, minimizing the Euclidean norms of manipulation forces and torques.	Semantic Scholar
Physical plausibility in the optimization solution is ensured by constraining the internal and manipulation wrench by the applied wrench.	Semantic Scholar
We analyze specific cases of three-fingered grasping and 2-D beam manipulation, and show the applicability of our method to general object manipulation with multiple effectors.	Semantic Scholar
The wrench decomposition method is then extended to quantification of measures that are important in evaluating physical human–human and human–robot interaction tasks.	Semantic Scholar
We validate our approach via comparison to the state of the art in simulation and via application to a human–human object transport study.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, a sparse Markov decision process (MDP) with novel causal sparse Tsallis entropy regularization is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed policy regularization induces a sparse and multimodal optimal policy distribution of a sparse MDP.	Semantic Scholar
The full mathematical analysis of the proposed sparse MDP is provided.	Semantic Scholar
We first analyze the optimality condition of a sparse MDP.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we propose a sparse value iteration method that solves a sparse MDP and then prove the convergence and optimality of sparse value iteration using the Banach fixed-point theorem.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed sparse MDP is compared to soft MDPs that utilize causal entropy regularization.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the performance error of a sparse MDP has a constant bound, while the error of a soft MDP increases logarithmically with respect to the number of actions, where this performance error is caused by the introduced regularization term.	Semantic Scholar
In experiments, we apply sparse MDPs to reinforcement learning problems.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of the convergence speed and performance.	Semantic Scholar
Policy search is a class of reinforcement learning algorithms for finding optimal policies in control problems with limited feedback.	Semantic Scholar
These methods have been shown to be successful in high-dimensional problems such as robotics control.	Semantic Scholar
Though successful, current methods can lead to unsafe policy parameters that potentially could damage hardware units.	Semantic Scholar
Motivated by such constraints, we propose projection-based methods for safe policies.	Semantic Scholar
These methods, however, can handle only convex policy constraints.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose the first safe policy search reinforcement learner capable of operating under nonconvex policy constraints.	Semantic Scholar
This is achieved by observing, for the first time, a connection between nonconvex variational inequalities and policy search problems.	Semantic Scholar
We provide two algorithms, Mann and two-step iteration, to solve the above problems and prove convergence in the nonconvex stochastic setting.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the algorithms on six benchmark dynamical systems and show that our new method is capable of outperforming previous methods under a variety of settings.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a motion model that focuses on the discriminative parts of the human body related to target motions to classify human motions into specific categories, and apply this model to multi-class daily motion classifications.	Semantic Scholar
We extend this model to a motion recognition system which generates multiple sentences associated with human motions.	Semantic Scholar
The motion model is evaluated with the following four datasets acquired by a Kinect sensor or multiple infrared cameras in a motion capture studio: UCF-kinect; UT-kinect; HDM05-mocap; and YNL-mocap.	Semantic Scholar
We also evaluate the sentences generated from the dataset of motion and language pairs.	Semantic Scholar
The experimental results indicate that the motion model improves classification accuracy and our approach is better than other state-of-the-art methods for specific datasets, including human–object interactions with variations in the duration of motions, such as daily human motions.	Semantic Scholar
We achieve a classification rate of 81.1% for multi-class daily motion classifications in a non cross-subject setting.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, the sentences generated by the motion recognition system are semantically and syntactically appropriate for the description of the target motion, which may lead to human–robot interaction using natural language.	Semantic Scholar

Studies suggest that the level of muscle activation may influence force reproduction.	Semantic Scholar
The purpose of this study was to develop a sensorimotor-enhancing suit (SEnS)—unpowered assistive clothing without actuators or electrical devices—and to examine its efficacy for reducing voluntary muscle activation and improving force reproduction in the upper limb in healthy young adults.	Semantic Scholar
The SEnS was made of elastic fabric and designed to produce assistive shoulder flexion moment that can partially mitigate the required activation of the user's shoulder flexor muscles.	Semantic Scholar
A series of human experiments were then conducted in healthy young adults.	Semantic Scholar
As a proof of concept, reduction in force reproduction performance of the shoulder moment was confirmed with mitigation of the shoulder moment by using an external string.	Semantic Scholar
To examine the efficacy of the SEnS, voluntary muscle activation and force reproduction performance was examined with and without using the SEnS, by comparing the amount of activation in the shoulder flexor muscles and the error in force reproduction in the upper limb.	Semantic Scholar
The results showed that wearing SEnS reduced muscle activation and force reproduction error.	Semantic Scholar
These results suggest that the accuracy of force reproduction can be improved substantially by partially mitigating the shoulder moment and associated voluntary muscle activation, using the SEnS.	Semantic Scholar
For robots that act outside of tightly controlled environments, force control is often better suited than position control.	Semantic Scholar
Series clutch actuators, used without an elastic element, can achieve excellent position control or can be used as a force/torque source.	Semantic Scholar
Clutches based on different physical principles can be employed; while recently a lot of research has been performed on clutches based on magnetorheological fluid (MR fluid), they still have a relatively low torque-to-weight ratio, which makes the integration into robots difficult.	Semantic Scholar
In industrial applications magnetic particle clutches are preferred, as they have proven their reliability, but they are even heavier for the same torque.	Semantic Scholar
Friction clutches have a higher torque-to-weight ratio, but are generally considered to be difficult to control.	Semantic Scholar
The goal of this research is to evaluate series clutch actuators with a high torque-to-weight ratio for open-loop torque control and collision safety.	Semantic Scholar
First, the characteristics of electromagnetically controlled clutches based on friction, MR fluid, and magnetic particles are profiled.	Semantic Scholar
Subsequently, simple model-based open loop torque control is implemented and the hysteresis, step response, and frequency response are evaluated.	Semantic Scholar
The friction clutch has a higher hysteresis and torque variation than the other clutches, but a faster step response and a comparable frequency response.	Semantic Scholar
Collision experiments are conducted and the results show that also for collisions the torque can be controlled.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, in contact free motion, by using clutch settings that fulfill the dynamic torque requirements, unhindered position control is feasible, and by using torque limits that are only slighter higher than the dynamic requirements, safer actuation can be achieved.	Semantic Scholar
In conclusion, electromagnetically controlled friction clutches not only have a high torque-to-weight ratio (in our case 8 N $\cdot$m/0.32 kg), but are also a viable option for torque control.	Semantic Scholar

The success of CNNs is accompanied by deep models and heavy storage costs.	Semantic Scholar
For compressing CNNs, we propose an efficient and robust pruning approach, cross-entropy pruning (CEP).	Semantic Scholar
Given a trained CNN model, connections were divided into groups in a group-wise way according to their corresponding output neurons.	Semantic Scholar
All connections with their cross-entropy errors below a grouping threshold were then removed.	Semantic Scholar
A sparse model was obtained and the number of parameters in the baseline model significantly reduced.	Semantic Scholar
This letter also presents a highest cross-entropy pruning (HCEP) method that keeps a small portion of weights with the highest CEP.	Semantic Scholar
This method further improves the accuracy of CEP.	Semantic Scholar
To validate CEP, we conducted the experiments on low redundant networks that are hard to compress.	Semantic Scholar
For the MNIST data set, CEP achieves an 0.08% accuracy drop required by LeNet-5 benchmark with only 16% of original parameters.	Semantic Scholar
Our proposed CEP also reduces approximately 75% of the storage cost of AlexNet on the ILSVRC 2012 data set, increasing the top-1 errorby only 0.4% and top-5 error by only 0.2%.	Semantic Scholar
Compared with three existing methods on LeNet-5, our proposed CEP and HCEP perform significantly better than the existing methods in terms of the accuracy and stability.	Semantic Scholar
Some computer vision tasks on CNNs such as object detection and style transfer can be computed in a high-performance way using our CEP and HCEP strategies.	Semantic Scholar
Flying in unknown environments may lead to unforeseen collisions, which may cause serious damage to the robot and/or its environment.	Semantic Scholar
In this context, fast and robust collision detection combined with safe reaction is, therefore, essential and may be achieved using external wrench information.	Semantic Scholar
Also, deliberate physical interaction requires a control loop designed for such a purpose and may require knowledge of the contact wrench.	Semantic Scholar
In principle, the external wrench may be measured or estimated.	Semantic Scholar
Whereas measurement poses large demands on sensor equipment, additional weight, and overall system robustness, in this paper we present a novel model-based method for external wrench estimation in flying robots.	Semantic Scholar
The algorithm is based on the onboard inertial measurement unit and the robot's dynamics model only.	Semantic Scholar
We design admittance and impedance controllers that use this estimate for sensitive and robust physical interaction.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the performance of several collision detection and reaction schemes is investigated in order to ensure collision safety.	Semantic Scholar
The identified collision location and associated normal vector located on the robot's convex hull may then be used for sensorless tactile sensing.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, a low-level collision reflex layer is provided for flying robots when obstacle avoidance fails, also under wind influence.	Semantic Scholar
Our experimental and simulation results show evidence that the methodologies are easily implemented and effective in practice.	Semantic Scholar
Existing graph classification usually relies on an exhaustive enumeration of substructure patterns, where the number of substructures expands exponentially w.r.t.	Semantic Scholar
with the size of the graph set.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph kernel has achieved the best performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency among state-of-the-art methods.	Semantic Scholar
However, it is still time-consuming, especially for large-scale graph classification tasks.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present a -Ary Tree based Hashing (KATH) algorithm, which is able to obtain competitive accuracy with a very fast runtime.	Semantic Scholar
"The main idea of KATH is to construct a traversal table to quickly approximate the subtree patterns in WL using <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$K$</tex-math></inline-formula>-ary trees."	Semantic Scholar
"Based on the traversal table, KATH employs a recursive indexing process that performs only <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$r$ </tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""wu-ieq3-2782278.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> times of matrix indexing to generate all <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$(r-1)$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""wu-ieq4-2782278.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula>-depth <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$K$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""wu-ieq5-2782278.gif""/></alternatives> </inline-formula>-ary trees, where the leaf node labels of a tree can uniquely specify the pattern."	Semantic Scholar
After that, the MinHash scheme is used to fingerprint the acquired subtree patterns for a graph.	Semantic Scholar
Our experimental results on both real world and synthetic data sets show that KATH runs significantly faster than state-of-the-art methods while achieving competitive or better accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
To be effective, robots will need to reliably operate in scenes with refractive objects in a variety of applications; however, refractive objects can cause many robotic vision algorithms, such as structure from motion, to become unreliable or even fail.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel method to distinguish between refracted and Lambertian image features using a light field camera.	Semantic Scholar
While previous refracted feature detection methods are limited to light field cameras with large baselines relative to the refractive object, our method achieves comparable performance, and we extend these capabilities to light field cameras with much smaller baselines than previously considered, where we achieve up to 50% higher refracted feature detection rates.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we propose to use textural cross correlation to characterize apparent feature motion in a single light field, and compare this motion to its Lambertian equivalent based on 4-D light field geometry.	Semantic Scholar
For structure from motion, we demonstrate that rejecting refracted features using our distinguisher yields lower reprojection error, lower failure rates, and more accurate pose estimates when the robot is approaching refractive objects.	Semantic Scholar
Our method is a critical step toward allowing robots to operate in the presence of refractive objects.	Semantic Scholar
Research indicates that human–robot interaction can help children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).	Semantic Scholar
While most early robot-mediated interaction studies were based on free interactions, recent studies have shown that robot-mediated interventions that focus on the core impairments of ASD such as joint attention deficit tend to produce better outcomes.	Semantic Scholar
Joint attention impairment is one of the core deficits in ASD that has an important impact in the neuropsychological development of these children.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a novel joint attention intervention system for children with ASD that overcomes several existing limitations in this domain such as the need to use body-worn sensors, nonautonomous robot operation requiring human involvement and lack of a formal model for robot-mediated joint attention interaction.	Semantic Scholar
We present a fully autonomous robotic system, called noncontact-responsive robot-mediated intervention system, that can infer attention through a distributed noncontact gaze inference mechanism with an embedded least-to-most (LTM) robot-mediated interaction model to address the current limitations.	Semantic Scholar
The system was tested in a multisession user study with 14 young children with ASD.	Semantic Scholar
The results showed that participants’ joint attention skills improved significantly, their interest in the robot remained consistent throughout the sessions, and the LTM interaction model was effective in promoting the children's performance.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we introduce an anthropomorphic robot hand by proposing a pneumatic dual-mode actuation mechanism powered by a compact pneumatic power generator based on the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.	Semantic Scholar
Since the pneumatic power generator has limited gas supply ability for each fuel charge, a pneumatic dual-mode actuation mechanism is proposed to reduce the amount of gas consumed for each grasp action while maintaining the robot hand's fast grasping speed and large grasping force.	Semantic Scholar
Driven by the proposed pneumatic dual-mode actuation mechanism, the designed robot finger provides maximum 468°/s flexion speed and 29.1 N fingertip force.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the proposed pneumatic dual-mode actuation mechanism, a robot hand with 198 × 79 × 31 mm3 size and 420 g weight is designed.	Semantic Scholar
A differential mechanism and passive thumb abduction–adduction mechanism are applied for compact design and efficient gas consumption and the performance is verified with experiments.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the robot hand was connected to the pneumatic power generator loaded with 80 ml of 70% hydrogen peroxide solution and provided more than 1250 repetitions of the grasping motion for the maximum gas consumption case, which is suitable to perform daily work when applied as a prosthetic hand.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose a new framework of external force sensing for soft robots based on the fusion of vision-based measurements and finite element model (FEM) techniques.	Semantic Scholar
A precise mechanical model of the robot is built using real-time FEM to describe the relationship between the external forces acting on the robot and the displacement of the predefined feature points.	Semantic Scholar
The position of these feature points on the real robot is measured using a vision system and is compared with the equivalent feature points in the finite element model.	Semantic Scholar
Using the compared displacement, the intensities of the external forces are computed by solving an inverse problem.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the developed FEM equations, we show that not only the intensities but also the locations of the external forces can be estimated.	Semantic Scholar
A strategy is proposed to find the correct locations of external forces among several possible ones.	Semantic Scholar
The method is verified and validated using both simulation and experiments on a soft sheet and a parallel soft robot (both of them have nontrivial shapes).	Semantic Scholar
The good results obtained from the experimental study demonstrate the capability of our approach.	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a rotational contour signatures (RCS) method for both real-valued and binary descriptions of 3D local shape.	Semantic Scholar
RCS comprises several signatures that characterize the 2D contour information derived from 3D-to-2D projection of the local point cloud.	Semantic Scholar
The inspiration of our encoding technique comes from that when viewing towards an object, its contour is an effective and robust cue for representing its shape.	Semantic Scholar
In order to achieve a comprehensive geometry encoding, the local surface is continually rotated in a predefined local reference frame (LRF) so that multi-view information is obtained.	Semantic Scholar
A peculiar trait of our RCS method is its seamless extension to binary representations to accelerate feature matching and reduce storage consumption.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we resort to three techniques, i.e., thresholding, quantization and geometrical binary encoding, to generate RCS binary strings.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to 2D image area, there are quite rare 3D binary descriptors yet in 3D computer vision.	Semantic Scholar
We deploy experiments on three standard datasets including shape retrieval, 3D object recognition and 2.5D point cloud view matching scenarios with a rigorous comparison with six state-of-the-art descriptors.	Semantic Scholar
The comparative outcomes confirm numerous merits of our RCS method, e.g., highly discriminative, compact, computational efficient and robust to many nuisances including noise, ∗Corresponding author Email addresses: jqyang@hust.edu.cn (Jiaqi Yang), hangfanzq@163.com (Qian Zhang), kexian@hust.edu.cn (Ke Xian), Yang_Xiao@hust.edu.cn (Yang Xiao), zgcao@hust.edu.cn (Zhiguo Cao) Preprint submitted to Journal of LTEX Templates February 16, 2017	Semantic Scholar
Microscopy has been an indispensable tool for micro/nanosample imaging, manipulation, and characterization.	Semantic Scholar
However, viewing the micro/nanosample from multidirection is still a big challenge for current microscopy.	Semantic Scholar
To address the above issue, this paper proposes a novel nanorobotic manipulation system for the automatic alignment and multidirectional imaging under microscopes.	Semantic Scholar
First, a miniature rotation robot with three degrees of freedom is designed and integrated with a microscope.	Semantic Scholar
Then, a forward-backward alignment strategy containing three loops, i.e., position shift loop, angle loop, and magnification loop, is proposed to align the sample to the rotation axis of the robot automatically.	Semantic Scholar
After that, the sample is imaged from multidirection by rotating the robot with one revolution (360°).	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the alignment accuracy is evaluated and multi-directional images of various samples are implemented.	Semantic Scholar
This study provides a new way for the microscopic imaging, which is expected to exert a significant impact in multiple fields on a small scale, including microscopy imaging, microdefect detection, micromanipulation, in situ characterization, and so on.	Semantic Scholar

To ensure the reliability and ruggedness in harsh environment, protection measures were added to both electrical system and crucial mechanical parts.	Semantic Scholar
To negotiate rough terrain effectively, hybrid mode was introduced, which is more efficient comparing with other legged modes and easier to transit among three supporting gestures according to the variation of terrain situation.	Semantic Scholar
Each joint has been measured to follow accurate trajectories of position.	Semantic Scholar
Indoor and outdoor tests were conducted with the described hybrid mode, which verified the whole design and the negotiability in rough terrain.	Semantic Scholar
Notwithstanding the seemingly straightforward nature of the inertial parameter identification problem for multibody systems—the most common formulation is as a linear least-squares estimation problem—existing methods, especially for complex high-dof systems subject to nonpersistent and noisy measurements, tend to be highly sensitive to the choice of initial values, and more often than not converge to ad hoc solutions that lie on arbitrary user-specified boundaries.	Semantic Scholar
We argue in this letter that such ill-posed behavior is traceable in large part to the use of the standard Euclidean metric in the regularized least-squares error criterion.	Semantic Scholar
We instead make use of the fact that the collection of inertial parameters constitutes a Riemannian manifold with a naturally defined Riemannian metric.	Semantic Scholar
By formulating and minimizing a coordinate-invariant error criterion based on this natural Riemannian metric, we show that accuracy and robustness of the identification can be vastly improved.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments involving high-dof humanoid structures are presented to validate our method and claims.	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a distributed algorithm for cooperatively manipulating an object rigidly grasped by a team of mobile manipulators.	Semantic Scholar
In order to increase the flexibility of the multi-robot cell and differently from other approaches, it is assumed that the object is completely unknown and there is not information exchange between robots.	Semantic Scholar
The devised strategy includes two stages: at the first stage, each robot estimates the object kinematic and dynamic parameters by applying specific contact wrenches, while, in the second stage, the estimated parameters are exploited within a distributed cooperative control framework that can be adopted, for instance, to control the interaction wrench exerted by the environment on the object or to implement a zero-force control algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
In addition to the total absence of communication and differently from existing solutions, the proposed technique assumes that each robot has not knowledge of the number of cooperative agents in the team and, remarkably, it is devised in the 3-dimensional space with the aim of handling both the position and the orientation of the object.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the feasibility of the approach is proven via numerical simulations.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, without transforming the second order inertial neural networks into the first order differential systems by some variable substitutions, asymptotic stability and synchronization for a class of delayed inertial neural networks are investigated.	Semantic Scholar
Firstly, a new Lyapunov functional is constructed to directly propose the asymptotic stability of the inertial neural networks, and some new stability criteria are derived by means of Barbalat Lemma.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, by designing a new feedback control strategy, the asymptotic synchronization of the addressed inertial networks is studied and some effective conditions are obtained.	Semantic Scholar
To reduce the control cost, an adaptive control scheme is designed to realize the asymptotic synchronization.	Semantic Scholar
It is noted that the dynamical behaviors of inertial neural networks are directly analyzed in this paper by constructing some new Lyapunov functionals, this is totally different from the traditional reduced-order variable substitution method.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, some numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived theoretical results.	Semantic Scholar
The dynamics of complex-valued fractional-order neuronal networks are investigated, focusing on stability, instability and Hopf bifurcations.	Semantic Scholar
Sufficient conditions for the asymptotic stability and instability of a steady state of the network are derived, based on the complex system parameters and the fractional order of the system, considering simplified neuronal connectivity structures (hub and ring).	Semantic Scholar
In some specific cases, it is possible to identify the critical values of the fractional order for which Hopf bifurcations may occur.	Semantic Scholar
Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the theoretical findings and to investigate the stability of the limit cycles which appear due to Hopf bifurcations.	Semantic Scholar
Disaster response, especially fire-fighting and rescue, is highly risky for firefighters engaged in action.	Semantic Scholar
As a result, many robots intended for fire-fighting have been proposed.	Semantic Scholar
However, it is difficult for them to directly access fire sources because their mobility is limited.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, existing robots are large and heavy.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we propose a novel hose-type robot, which can fly directly into the fire source via a water jet.	Semantic Scholar
First, to control the reaction force for stable flying, we developed a nozzle module.	Semantic Scholar
By combining two nozzles whose outlet direction can be controlled, the resultant reaction force can be controlled.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we developed a robot with a nozzle module and conducted an experiment.	Semantic Scholar
The experiment demonstrates that a robot with a length of approximately 2 m can fly stably in the air by leveraging the water jet.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the head direction can also be controlled.	Semantic Scholar
To solve the task of segmenting clusters of nearly identical objects we here present the template rotation expectation maximization (TREM) approach which is based on a generative model.	Semantic Scholar
We explore both a non-linear optimization approach for maximizing the loglikelihood and a modification of the standard expectation maximization (EM) algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
The non-linear approach is strict template matching , while the linear TREM allows for a more deformable model.	Semantic Scholar
As benchmarking we compare TREM with standard EM for a two dimensional Gaussian mixture model (GMM) as well as direct maximization of the log-likelihood using non-linear optimization.	Semantic Scholar
We find that the linear algorithms, TREM and standard GMM, are faster than the non-linear algorithms without any loss of segmentation accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
In the comparison between the linear models we find an edge for the linear TREM on our data as it better approximates the orientation and shape of the objects than the standard GMM.	Semantic Scholar
This paper considers the problem of manipulating a uniformly rotating chain: the chain is rotated at a constant angular speed around a fixed axis using a robotic manipulator.	Semantic Scholar
Manipulation is quasi-static in the sense that transitions are slow enough for the chain to be always in “rotational equilibrium.” The curve traced by the chain in a rotating plane—its shape function—can be determined by a simple force analysis, yet it possesses a complex multisolutions behavior that is typical of nonlinear systems.	Semantic Scholar
We prove that the configuration space of the uniformly rotating chain is homeomorphic to a two-dimensional surface embedded in  $\mathbb {R}^3$.	Semantic Scholar
Using that representation, we devise a manipulation strategy for transiting between different rotation modes in a stable and controlled manner.	Semantic Scholar
We demonstrate the strategy on a physical robotic arm manipulating a rotating chain.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, we discuss how the ideas developed here might find fruitful applications in the study of other flexible objects, such as in circular aerial manipulation with UAVs.	Semantic Scholar
Discrete simulation of complex multiworker physical processes, for ergonomic and/or performance analysis, is still relatively undeveloped.	Semantic Scholar
Existing approaches typically have taken either a classical simulation view of the problem (focus on activities, resources, and queues: workers treated as machines) or an analytical ergonomics perspective (detailed human modeling and ergonomic assessment for well-defined limited tasks).	Semantic Scholar
This paper presents a new way to tackle such problems, based upon elements of both of these approaches.	Semantic Scholar
Novel methods are described for modeling complex multiworker physical processes within a traditional discrete-event simulation environment.	Semantic Scholar
These methods result in a high-level language for generating activity-based process models quickly and easily, based upon simplified activity representations.	Semantic Scholar
Laboratory experiments are used to derive equations that can then be used to generate ergonomic assessments (i.e., relative injury risks) for the most influential activities.	Semantic Scholar
By implementing these equations using data generated from a simulation run, estimates of ergonomic consequences can be obtained.	Semantic Scholar
To illustrate the approach, it is applied to the panelized residential housing construction process, where multiple workers build houses by moving and installing large heavy prefabricated wall panels.	Semantic Scholar
The example illustrates the steps presented and feasibility of the approach.	Semantic Scholar
Previous research shows that a cardinality reasoning can improve the pruning of the bin-packing constraint.	Semantic Scholar
We first introduce a new algorithm, called BPCFlow, that filters both load and cardinality bounds on the bins, using a flow reasoning similar to the Global Cardinality Constraint.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, we detect impossible assignments of items by combining the load and cardinality of the bins, using a method to detect items that are either ”too-big” or ”too-small”.	Semantic Scholar
This method is adapted to two previously existing filtering techniques along with BPCFlow, creating three new propagators.	Semantic Scholar
We then experiment the four new algorithms on Balanced Academic Curriculum Problem and Tank Allocation Problem instances.	Semantic Scholar
BPCFlow is shown to be stronger than previously existing filtering, and more computationally intensive.	Semantic Scholar
We show that the new filtering is useful on a small number of hard instances, while being too expensive for general use.	Semantic Scholar
Our results show that the introduced ”too-big/too-small” filtering can most of the time drastically reduce the size of the search tree and the computation time.	Semantic Scholar
This method is profitable in 88% of the tested instances.	Semantic Scholar

We propose a pulse neural network that exhibits chaotic pattern alternations among stored patterns as a model of multistable perception, which is reflected in phenomena such as binocular rivalry and perceptual ambiguity.	Semantic Scholar
When we regard the mixed state of patterns as a part of each pattern, the durations of the retrieved pattern obey unimodal distributions.	Semantic Scholar
We confirmed that no chaotic properties are observed in the time series of durations, consistent with the findings of previous psychological studies.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, it is shown that our model also reproduces two properties of multistable perception that characterize the relationship between the contrast of inputs and the durations.	Semantic Scholar
Autoassociative morphological memories (AMMs) are robust and computationally efficient memory models with unlimited storage capacity.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we present the max-plus and min-plus projection autoassociative morphological memories (PAMMs) as well as their compositions.	Semantic Scholar
Briefly, the max-plus PAMM yields the largest max-plus combination of the stored vectors which is less than or equal to the input.	Semantic Scholar
Dually, the vector recalled by the min-plus PAMM corresponds to the smallest min-plus combination which is larger than or equal to the input.	Semantic Scholar
Apart from unlimited absolute storage capacity and one step retrieval, PAMMs and their compositions exhibit an excellent noise tolerance.	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the new memories yielded quite promising results in classification problems with a large number of features and classes.	Semantic Scholar
A novel measure of neural spike train randomness, an entropy factor, is proposed.	Semantic Scholar
It is based on the Shannon entropy of the number of spikes in a time window and can be seen as an analogy to the Fano factor.	Semantic Scholar
Theoretical properties of the new measure are studied for equilibrium renewal processes and further illustrated on gamma and inverse Gaussian probability distributions of interspike intervals.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, the entropy factor is evaluated from the experimental records of spontaneous activity in macaque primary visual cortex and compared to its theoretical behavior deduced for the renewal process models.	Semantic Scholar
Both theoretical and experimental results show substantial differences between the Fano and entropy factors.	Semantic Scholar
Rather paradoxically, an increase in the variability of spike count is often accompanied by an increase of its predictability, as evidenced by the entropy factor.	Semantic Scholar
Social recommender system, using social relation networks as additional input to improve the accuracy of traditional recommender systems, has become an important research topic.	Semantic Scholar
However, most existing methods utilize the entire user relationship network with no consideration to its huge size, sparsity, imbalance, and noise issues.	Semantic Scholar
This may degrade the efficiency and accuracy of social recommender systems.	Semantic Scholar
This study proposes a new approach to manage the complexity of adding social relation networks to recommender systems.	Semantic Scholar
Our method first generates an individual relationship network (IRN) for each user and item by developing a novel fitting algorithm of relationship networks to control the relationship propagation and contracting.	Semantic Scholar
We then fuse matrix factorization with social regularization and the neighborhood model using IRN's to generate recommendations.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach is quite general, and can also be applied to the item-item relationship network by switching the roles of users and items.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments on four datasets with different sizes, sparsity levels, and relationship types show that our approach can improve predictive accuracy and gain a better scalability compared with state-of-the-art social recommendation methods.	Semantic Scholar
Decoding in the context of brain-machine interface is a prediction problem, with the aim of retrieving the most accurate kinematic predictions attainable from the available neural signals.	Semantic Scholar
While selecting models that reduce the prediction error is done to various degrees, decoding has not received the attention that the fields of statistics and machine learning have lavished on the prediction problem in the past two decades.	Semantic Scholar
Here, we take a more systematic approach to the decoding prediction problem and search for risk-optimized reverse regression, optimal linear estimation (OLE), and Kalman filter models within a large model space composed of several nonlinear transformations of neural spike counts at multiple temporal lags.	Semantic Scholar
The reverse regression decoding framework is a standard prediction problem, where penalized methods such as ridge regression or Lasso are routinely used to find minimum risk models.	Semantic Scholar
We argue that minimum risk reverse regression is always more efficient than OLE and also happens to be 44% more efficient than a standard Kalman filter in a particular application of offline reconstruction of arm reaches of a rhesus macaque monkey.	Semantic Scholar
Yet model selection for tuning curves–based decoding models such as OLE and Kalman filtering is not a standard statistical prediction problem, and no efficient method exists to identify minimum risk models.	Semantic Scholar
We apply several methods to build low-risk models and show that in our application, a Kalman filter that includes multiple carefully chosen observation equations per neural unit is 67% more efficient than a standard Kalman filter, but with the drawback that finding such a model is computationally very costly.	Semantic Scholar
Open-domain conversation is one of the most challenging artificial intelligence problems, which involves language understanding, reasoning, and the utilization of common sense knowledge.	Semantic Scholar
The goal of this paper is to further improve the response generation, using personalization criteria.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel method called PRGDDA (Personalized Response Generation by Dual-learning based Domain Adaptation) which is a personalized response generation model based on theories of domain adaptation and dual learning.	Semantic Scholar
During the training procedure, PRGDDA first learns the human responding style from large general data (without user-specific information), and then fine-tunes the model on a small size of personalized data to generate personalized conversations with a dual learning mechanism.	Semantic Scholar
We conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model on two real-world datasets in both English and Chinese.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental results show that our model can generate better personalized responses for different users.	Semantic Scholar

Most commercial optical sorting systems are designed to achieve high throughput, so they use a naive low-latency image processing for object identification.	Semantic Scholar
These naive low-latency algorithms have difficulty in accurately identifying objects with various shapes, textures, sizes, and colors, so the purity of sorted objects is degraded.	Semantic Scholar
Current deep learning technology enables robust image detection and classification, but its inference latency requires several milliseconds; thus, deep learning cannot be directly applied to such real-time high throughput applications.	Semantic Scholar
We therefore developed a super-high purity seed sorting system that uses a low-latency image-recognition based on a deep neural network and removes the seeds of noxious weeds from mixed seed product at high throughput with accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed system partitions the detection task into localization and classification, and applies batch inference only once strategy; it achieved 500-fps throughput image-recognition including detection and tracking.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the classified and tracked results, air ejectors expel the unwanted seeds.	Semantic Scholar
This proposed system eliminates almost the whole weeds with small loss of desired seeds, and is superior to current commercial optical sorting systems.	Semantic Scholar
Civilian drones are soon expected to be used in a wide variety of tasks, such as aerial surveillance, delivery, or monitoring of existing architectures.	Semantic Scholar
Nevertheless, their deployment in urban environments has so far been limited.	Semantic Scholar
Indeed, in unstructured and highly dynamic scenarios, drones face numerous challenges to navigate autonomously in a feasible and safe way.	Semantic Scholar
In contrast to traditional “map-localize-plan” methods, this letter explores a data-driven approach to cope with the above challenges.	Semantic Scholar
To accomplish this, we propose DroNet: a convolutional neural network that can safely drive a drone through the streets of a city.	Semantic Scholar
Designed as a fast eight-layers residual network, DroNet produces two outputs for each single input image: A steering angle to keep the drone navigating while avoiding obstacles, and a collision probability to let the UAV recognize dangerous situations and promptly react to them.	Semantic Scholar
The challenge is however to collect enough data in an unstructured outdoor environment such as a city.	Semantic Scholar
Clearly, having an expert pilot providing training trajectories is not an option given the large amount of data required and, above all, the risk that it involves for other vehicles or pedestrians moving in the streets.	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we propose to train a UAV from data collected by cars and bicycles, which, already integrated into the urban environment, would not endanger other vehicles and pedestrians.	Semantic Scholar
Although trained on city streets from the viewpoint of urban vehicles, the navigation policy learned by DroNet is highly generalizable.	Semantic Scholar
Indeed, it allows a UAV to successfully fly at relative high altitudes and even in indoor environments, such as parking lots and corridors.	Semantic Scholar
To share our findings with the robotics community, we publicly release all our datasets, code, and trained networks.	Semantic Scholar
The recent emergence of bioinspired event cameras has opened up exciting new possibilities in high-frequency tracking, bringing robustness to common problems in traditional vision, such as lighting changes and motion blur.	Semantic Scholar
In order to leverage these attractive attributes of the event cameras, research has been focusing on understanding how to process their unusual output: an asynchronous stream of events.	Semantic Scholar
With the majority of existing techniques discretizing the event-stream essentially forming frames of events grouped according to their timestamp, we are still to exploit the power of these cameras.	Semantic Scholar
In this spirit, this letter proposes a new, purely event-based corner detector, and a novel corner tracker, demonstrating that it is possible to detect corners and track them directly on the event stream in real time.	Semantic Scholar
Evaluation on benchmarking datasets reveals a significant boost in the number of detected corners and the repeatability of such detections over the state of the art even in challenging scenarios with the proposed approach while enabling more than a 4$\times$ speed-up when compared to the most efficient algorithm in the literature.

The proposed pipeline detects and tracks corners at a rate of more than 7.5 million events per second, promising great impact in high-speed applications.	Semantic Scholar

Weapon systems with increasing autonomy are being developed due to fast improvements in machine learning, robotics, and automation in general.	Semantic Scholar
These developments raise important and complex security, legal, ethical, societal, and technological issues that are being extensively discussed by scholars, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), militaries, governments, and the international community.	Semantic Scholar
Unfortunately, the robotics community has stayed out of the debate, for the most part, despite being the main provider of autonomous technologies.	Semantic Scholar
In this column, we review the main issues raised by the increase of autonomy in weapon systems and the state of the international discussion.	Semantic Scholar

We describe a methodology to design foot soles for a humanoid robot given walking gait parameters (i.e.	Semantic Scholar
given centerof-mass and zero-moment-point trajectories).	Semantic Scholar
In order to obtain an optimized compliant sole, we devised a shape optimization framework which takes –among other inputs, an initial rough (simplified) shape of the sole and refines it through successive optimization steps under additional constraints and a cost function.	Semantic Scholar
The shape is optimized based on the simulation of the sole deformation during an entire walking step, taking time dependent input of the walking pattern generator into account.	Semantic Scholar
Our shape optimization framework is able to minimize the impact of the foot with the ground during the heel-strike phase and to limit foot rotation in case of perturbations.	Semantic Scholar
Indeed, low foot rotation enforces a vertical posture and secures the balance of the humanoid robot.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, weight restriction (formulated as a constraint on the sole volume) is added to our optimization problem.	Semantic Scholar
This paper concerns the time-dependent shortest path problem, which is difficult to come up with global optimal solution by means of classical shortest path approaches such as Dijkstra, and pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN).	Semantic Scholar
In this study, we propose a time-delay neural network (TDNN) framework that comes with the globally optimal solution when solving the time-dependent shortest path problem.	Semantic Scholar
The underlying idea of TDNN comes from the following mechanism: the shortest path depends on the earliest auto-wave (from start node) that arrives at the destination node.	Semantic Scholar
In the design of TDNN, each node on a network is considered as a neuron, which comes in the form of two units: time-window unit and auto-wave unit.	Semantic Scholar
Time-window unit is used to generate auto-wave in each time window, while auto-wave unit is exploited here to update the state of auto-wave.	Semantic Scholar
Whether or not an auto-wave leaves a node (neuron) depends on the state of auto-wave.	Semantic Scholar
The evaluation of the performance of the proposed approach was carried out based on online public Cordeau instances and New York Road instances.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed TDNN was also compared with the quality of classical approaches such as Dijkstra and PCNN.	Semantic Scholar
We extend the neural Turing machine (NTM) model into a dynamic neural Turing machine (D-NTM) by introducing trainable address vectors.	Semantic Scholar

Recently, digitizing tablets have allowed the study of kinematic characteristics of handwriting and a series of parameters were estimated on cursive writing of Italian children.	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, the influence of a new rehabilitation protocol (Terzi's method) on kinematics of cursive writing was evaluated.	Semantic Scholar
The analysis was carried out on 22 nonproficient handwriting children, attending primary or secondary school, which undertook a series of three exercises, with and without linguistic concerns.	Semantic Scholar
A set of kinematic parameters was calculated before and after the rehabilitation process.	Semantic Scholar
The results showed that Terzi's rehabilitation program is capable of producing a significant velocity increase in the test without linguistic involvement, whereas a significant slowdown in the stroke realization was present in the other tasks.	Semantic Scholar
The effectiveness of Terzi's rehabilitation program was proved by significant improvements in the V.M.I.	Semantic Scholar

In order to solve general time-varying linear matrix equations (LMEs) more efficiently, this paper proposes two nonlinear recurrent neural networks based on two nonlinear activation functions.	Semantic Scholar
According to Lyapunov theory, such two nonlinear recurrent neural networks are proved to be convergent within finite-time.	Semantic Scholar
Besides, by solving differential equation, the upper bounds of the finite convergence time are determined analytically.	Semantic Scholar
Compared with existing recurrent neural networks, the proposed two nonlinear recurrent neural networks have a better convergence property (i.e., the upper bound is lower), and thus the accurate solutions of general time-varying LMEs can be obtained with less time.	Semantic Scholar
At last, various different situations have been considered by setting different coefficient matrices of general time-varying LMEs and a great variety of computer simulations (including the application to robot manipulators) have been conducted to validate the better finite-time convergence of the proposed two nonlinear recurrent neural networks.

We propose a novel calibration method for industrial Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) adopting the tricycle wheeled robot model and equipped with an on-board exteroceptive sensor.	Semantic Scholar
The method simultaneously estimates the calibration parameters for the odometry and the exteroceptive sensor using only the input commands and the sensor egomotion of the robot while executing segment paths.	Semantic Scholar
Two AGV models, both relevant to industrial practice, are considered: the standard tricycle model and an asymmetric one that takes into account the different weight distribution in forward and backward motions typical of industrial AGVs.	Semantic Scholar
The parameters of the standard model comprise the steering offset and driving scale, which measure the angular offset of the tricycle steering wheel and the distance increment corresponding to an encoder tick, and the three parameters representing the sensor pose.	Semantic Scholar
The asymmetric model adopts different values for the steering offset in forward and backward motions to account for the different weight distribution.	Semantic Scholar
Closed-form or compact solutions are provided for both problem formulations.	Semantic Scholar
The observability of the calibration procedure is also formally proved.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed automated calibration procedure has been implemented on industrial AGVs, leading to estimation of the parameters in about 12 minutes, a significant improvement compared with one hour or more required by manual AGV calibration.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments with AGVs of various sizes in warehouses have assessed the effectiveness and numerical stability of the proposed approach.	Semantic Scholar
The precision of calibration parameters has been found to be about 0.1 for angles and 6mm for positions.	Semantic Scholar
Parameters obtained via the proposed automated calibration procedure have allowed different AGVs to accurately stop at the desired operation points.	Semantic Scholar

One approach to the recognition of complex human activities is to use feature descriptors that encode visual interactions by describing properties of local visual features with respect to trajectories of tracked objects.	Semantic Scholar
We explore an example of such an approach in which dense tracklets are described relative to multiple reference trajectories, providing a rich representation of complex interactions between objects of which only a subset can be tracked.	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we report experiments in which reference trajectories are provided by tracking inertial sensors in a food preparation scenario.	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, we provide baseline results for HOG, HOF and MBH, and combine these features with others for multi-modal recognition.	Semantic Scholar
The proposed histograms of relative tracklets (RETLETS) showed better activity recognition performance than dense tracklets, HOG, HOF, MBH, or their combination.	Semantic Scholar
Our comparative evaluation of features from accelerometers and video highlighted a performance gap between visual and accelerometer-based motion features and showed a substantial performance gain when combining features from these sensor modalities.	Semantic Scholar
A considerable further performance gain was observed in combination with RETLETS and reference	Semantic Scholar
Enhancing haptic sensing allows more efficient control of interaction with unstructured and changing environments.	Semantic Scholar
Meanwhile, rich haptic information obtained during the interaction is useful for recognizing the environment.	Semantic Scholar
The haptic information contains distinctive physical features like friction, surface texture, local geometry, etc.	Semantic Scholar
However, how to combine these features for recognizing the environment is underexplored.	Semantic Scholar
Our previous work demonstrated that with accurate estimation of contact locations, and the direction and magnitude of the normal and tangential forces, a finger can follow unknown surfaces even with large changes in curvature while keeping a desired normal force.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter, we propose an object recognition method, using a multivariate Gaussian–Bayesian classifier that collectively combines the haptic information, including friction coefficients and surface roughness, with the local geometry to recognize the object after surface haptic exploration.	Semantic Scholar
Eighteen objects with different materials and shapes were tested, and results show that the method achieved a recognition accuracy of 92.3% on an average.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, we compared the method with six other classifiers, and concluded that it is easier to use while having high accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
Most importantly, it can show the levels of similarities between the features of different objects and provide a causal explanation of the recognition accuracy.	Semantic Scholar
This paves a way toward active and adaptive exploration where highly efficient recognition can be realized by selectively probing the most distinguishable features.	Semantic Scholar

Support vector machines, which maximize the margin from patterns to the separation hyperplane subject to correct classification, have received remarkable success in machine learning.	Semantic Scholar
Margin error bounds based on Hilbert spaces have been introduced in the literature to justify the strategy of maximizing the margin in SVM.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, there has been much interest in developing Banach space methods for machine learning.	Semantic Scholar
Large margin classification in Banach spaces is a focus of such attempts.	Semantic Scholar
In this letter we establish a margin error bound for the SVM on reproducing kernel Banach spaces, thus supplying statistical justification for large-margin classification in Banach spaces.	Semantic Scholar
Hyperspectral images (HSIs) have significant advantages over more traditional image types for a variety of computer vision applications dues to the extra information available.	Semantic Scholar
The practical reality of capturing and transmitting HSIs however, means that they often exhibit large amounts of noise, or are undersampled to reduce the data volume.	Semantic Scholar
Methods for combating such image corruption are thus critical to many HSIs applications.	Semantic Scholar
Here we devise a novel cluster sparsity field (CSF) based HSI reconstruction framework which explicitly models both the intrinsic correlation between measurements within the spectrum for a particular pixel, and the similarity between pixels due to the spatial structure of the HSI.	Semantic Scholar
These two priors have been shown to be effective previously, but have been always considered separately.	Semantic Scholar
By dividing pixels of the HSI into a group of spatial clusters on the basis of spectrum characteristics, we define CSF, a Markov random field based prior.	Semantic Scholar
In CSF, a structured sparsity potential models the correlation between measurements within each spectrum, and a graph structure potential models the similarity between pixels in each spatial cluster.	Semantic Scholar
Then, we integrate the CSF prior learning and image reconstruction into a unified variational framework for optimization, which makes the CSF prior image-specific, and robust to noise.	Semantic Scholar
It also results in more accurate image reconstruction compared with existing HSI reconstruction methods, thus combating the effects of noise corruption or undersampling.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments on HSI denoising and HSI compressive sensing demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	Semantic Scholar
This paper discusses the passivity of delayed reaction-diffusion memristor-based neural networks (RDMNNs).	Semantic Scholar
By exploiting inequality techniques and by constructing appropriate Lyapunov functional, several sufficient conditions are obtained in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be used to ascertain the passivity, output and input strict passivity of delayed RDMNNs.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, the passivity of RDMNNs without any delay is also considered.	Semantic Scholar
These conditions, represented by LMIs, can be easily verified by virtue of the Matlab toolbox.	Semantic Scholar
Finally, some illustrative examples are provided to substantiate the effectiveness and validity of the theoretical results, and to present an application of RDMNN in pseudo-random number generation.	Semantic Scholar
Reasoning with $$\mathcal {SROIQ(D)}$$ SROIQ(D) , the logic that underpins the popular Web Ontology Language (OWL), has a high worst case complexity (N2Exptime).	Semantic Scholar
Decomposing the ontology into modules prior to classification, and then classifying the composites one-by-one, has been suggested as a way to mitigate this complexity in practice.	Semantic Scholar
Modular reasoning is currently motivated by the potential for reducing the hardness of subsumption tests, reducing the number of necessary subsumption tests and integrating efficient delegate reasoners.	Semantic Scholar
To date, we have only a limited idea of what we can expect from modularity as an optimisation technique.	Semantic Scholar
We present sound evidence that, while the impact of subsumption testing is significant only for a small number of ontologies across a popular collection of 330 ontologies (BioPortal), modularity has a generally positive effect on subsumption test hardness (2-fold mean reduction in our sample).	Semantic Scholar
More than 50% of the tests did not change in hardness at all, however, and we observed large differences across reasoners.	Semantic Scholar
We conclude (1) that, in general, optimisations targeting subsumption test hardness need to be well motivated because of their comparatively modest overall impact on classification time and (2) that employing modularity for optimisation should not be motivated by beneficial effects on subsumption test hardness alone.

We formalize algebraic numbers in Isabelle/HOL.	Semantic Scholar
Our development serves as a verified implementation of algebraic operations on real and complex numbers.	Semantic Scholar
We moreover provide algorithms that can identify all the real or complex roots of rational polynomials, and two implementations to display algebraic numbers, an approximative version and an injective precise one.	Semantic Scholar
We obtain verified Haskell code for these operations via Isabelle’s code generator.	Semantic Scholar
The development combines various existing formalizations such as matrices, Sturm’s theorem, and polynomial factorization, and it includes new formalizations about bivariate polynomials, unique factorization domains, resultants and subresultants.	Semantic Scholar
We consider a team of heterogeneous robots, which are deployed within a common workspace to gather different types of data.	Semantic Scholar
The robots have different roles due to different capabilities: some gather data from the workspace (source robots) and others receive data from source robots and upload them to a data center (relay robots).	Semantic Scholar
The data-gathering tasks are specified locally to each source robot as high-level linear temporal logic formulas, which capture the different types of data that need to be gathered at different regions of interest.	Semantic Scholar
All robots have a limited buffer to store the data.	Semantic Scholar
Thus, the data gathered by source robots should be transferred to relay robots before their buffers overflow, respecting at the same time a limited communication range for all robots.	Semantic Scholar
The main contribution of this work is a distributed motion coordination and intermittent communication scheme that guarantees the satisfaction of all local tasks, while obeying the above constraints.	Semantic Scholar
The robot motion and interrobot communication are closely coupled and coordinated during runtime by scheduling intermittent meeting events to facilitate the local plan execution.	Semantic Scholar
We present both numerical simulations and experimental studies to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over existing approaches that predominantly require all-time network connectivity.	Semantic Scholar

The widespread location-aware applications produce a vast amount of spatio-textual data that contains both spatial and textual attributes.	Semantic Scholar
To make use of this enriched information for users to describe their preferences for travel routes, we propose a Bounded-Cost Informative Route (BCIR) query to retrieve the routes that are the most textually relevant to the user-specified query keywords subject to a travel cost constraint.	Semantic Scholar
BCIR query is particularly helpful for tourists and city explorers to plan their travel routes.	Semantic Scholar
We will show that BCIR query is an NP-hard problem.	Semantic Scholar
To answer BCIR query efficiently, we propose an exact solution with effective pruning techniques and two approximate solutions with performance guarantees.	Semantic Scholar
Extensive experiments over real data sets demonstrate that the proposed solutions achieve the expected performance.	Semantic Scholar
Social events such as networking parties are excellent opportunities to expand one's social network and make new social ties, as well as simply have fun and enjoy oneself.	Semantic Scholar
With the emergence of pervasive technology, we now have the opportunity to discover face-to-face socializing behaviors of individual guests and support them in their socializing goals.	Semantic Scholar
Quantitative measures of socializing behaviors will be useful in diverse applications from social therapy to social event management.	Semantic Scholar
We propose a system that detects and analyzes group-level socializing behaviors to support real-time and ex post facto social applications deployed in real social event situations.	Semantic Scholar
In our approach, we exploit attendees’ characteristics of socializing such as proximity and body orientation to determine social proximity among guests and subsequently detect socializing groups.	Semantic Scholar
We performed preliminary studies and multiple deployments of our system and example applications in real social networking parties.	Semantic Scholar
Evaluation shows the system can detect socializing groups accurately and support applications that satisfy the interests of guests and party hosts.	Semantic Scholar
Recent studies have demonstrated that Drosophila melanogaster (briefly Drosophila) can successfully perform higher cognitive processes including second order olfactory conditioning.	Semantic Scholar
Understanding the neural mechanism of this behavior can help neuroscientists to unravel the principles of information processing in complex neural systems (e.g.	Semantic Scholar

In this work, we have developed a biologically-inspired spiking neural network which is able to execute both first and second order conditioning.	Semantic Scholar
Experimental studies demonstrated that volume signaling (e.g.	Semantic Scholar
by the gaseous transmitter nitric oxide) contributes to memory formation in vertebrates and invertebrates including insects.	Semantic Scholar
Based on the existing knowledge of odor encoding in Drosophila, the role of retrograde signaling in memory function, and the integration of synaptic and non-synaptic neural signaling, a neural system is implemented as Simulated fly.	Semantic Scholar
Simulated fly navigates in a two-dimensional environment in which it receives odors and electric shocks as sensory stimuli.	Semantic Scholar
The model suggests some experimental research on retrograde signaling to investigate neural mechanisms of conditioning in insects and other animals.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, it illustrates a simple strategy to implement higher cognitive capabilities in machines including robots.	Semantic Scholar
Collaborative filtering is one of the most successful approaches to build recommendation systems.	Semantic Scholar
Recently, transfer learning has been applied to recommendation systems for incorporating information from external sources.	Semantic Scholar
However, most existing transfer collaborative filtering algorithms tend to transfer knowledge from one single source domain.	Semantic Scholar
Rich information is available in many source domains, which can better complement the data in the target domain than that from a single source.	Semantic Scholar
However, it is common to get inconsistent information from different sources.	Semantic Scholar
To this end, we proposed a TRA nsfer collaborative filtering framework from multiple sources via C onsE nsus R egularization, called TRACER for short.	Semantic Scholar
The TRACER framework handles the information inconsistency with a consensus regularization, which enforces the outputs from multiple sources to converge.	Semantic Scholar
In addition, our algorithm is to learn and transfer knowledge at the same time while most of the traditional transfer learning algorithms are to learn knowledge first and then transfer it.	Semantic Scholar
Experiments conducted on two real-world data sets validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
When RDF datasets become too large to be managed by centralised systems, they are often distributed in a cluster of shared-nothing servers, and queries are answered using a distributed join algorithm.	Semantic Scholar
Although such solutions have been extensively studied in relational and RDF databases, we argue that existing approaches exhibit two drawbacks.	Semantic Scholar
First, they usually decide statically(i.e., at query compile time) how to shuffle the data, which can lead to missed opportunities for local computation.	Semantic Scholar
Second, they often materialise large intermediate relations whose size is determined by the entire dataset (and not the data stored in each server), so these relations can easily exceed the memory of individual servers.	Semantic Scholar
As a possible remedy, we present a novel distributed join algorithm for RDF.	Semantic Scholar
Our approach decides when to shuffle data dynamically, which ensures that query answers that can be wholly produced within a server involve only local computation.	Semantic Scholar
It also uses a novel flow control mechanism to ensure that every query can be answered even if each server has a bounded amount of memory that is much smaller than the intermediate relations.	Semantic Scholar
We complement our algorithm with a new query planning approach that balances the cost of communication against the cost of local processing at each server.	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, as in several existing approaches, we distribute RDF data using graph partitioning so as to maximise local computation, but we refine the partitioning algorithm to produce more balanced partitions.	Semantic Scholar
We show empirically that our techniques can outperform the state of the art by orders of magnitude in terms of query evaluation times, network communication, and memory use.	Semantic Scholar
In particular, bounding the memory use in individual servers can mean the difference between success and failure for answering queries with large answer sets.	Semantic Scholar
