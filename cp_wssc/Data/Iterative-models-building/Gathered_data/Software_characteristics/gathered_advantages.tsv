Comparing their performance is difficult since both management systems are extremely useful and the core differences underlie their basic operations and initial approach.  	"advantages"
Both are open-source and easily available, as well as both systems offer commercial versions with tons of additional features. 	"advantages"
Another issue with the latter one is the owner’s focus on MariaDB development along with refuse to accept community patches and to provide sustainability plan.  	"advantages"
These factors have resulted in a standstill, though this solution is still the go-to solution for multiple companies worldwide. 	"advantages"
Comparing the speed, developers note that the latter one lacks speed and experience difficulties with large data volumes, so it’ll be a better choice for companies with smaller databases and looking for a more general solution.  	"advantages"
While this is one of the advantages of non-relational databases the ability to cope with large and unstructured amounts of data. 	"advantages"

Java and Python have many similarities.  	"advantages"
Both languages have strong cross-platform support and extensive standard libraries.  	"advantages"
They both treat (nearly) everything as objects.  	"advantages"
Both languages compile to bytecode, but Python is (usually) compiled at runtime.  	"advantages"
They are both members of the Algol family, although Python deviates further from C/C++ than Java does. 	"advantages"
Python has a more unified support model than Java for the first time, and open source developers are focusing their efforts on the latest version of the language. I have to give Python the edge here. 	"advantages"
Whether Python’s dynamic typing is better than Java’s static approach is subjective.  	"advantages"
The debate between the two models predates both of them, and it’s a question of what’s best for you and your team. 	"advantages"
After working on large projects in both languages, I feel secure saying that Python’s syntax is more concise than Java’s. It’s easier to get up and running quickly with a new project in Python than it is in Java. Python wins again. 	"advantages"
Performance is where Java has a substantial advantage over Python. 	"advantages"
Java’s just-in-time compilation gives it an advantage over Python’s interpreted performance.  	"advantages"
While neither language is suitable for latency-sensitive applications, Java is still a great deal faster than Python. 	"advantages"
All things considered, Python’s advantages outweigh the disadvantages. If you’re not already considering it, give it another look. 	"advantages"
The tests show that multi-model databases can compete with single model databases.  	"advantages"
It is faster at single document reads but couldn’t compete when it comes to aggregations or 2nd neighbors selections.  	"advantages"
Note: the shortest path query was not tested for some solutions as it would have to be implemented completely on the client side. 	"advantages"
The aggregation in ArangoDB is efficient which defines the baseline, only an explicit table column age in PostgreSQL is much faster. 	"advantages"
As PostgreSQL offers the JSON data type as well, you might want to check the performance is beyond everything you want to accept.  	"advantages"
All other databases are much slower than ArangoDB, from factor x2.5 in MongoDB to x20 in case of OrientDB. 	"advantages"
At least Neo4j and OrientDB can’t stand out in this test despite it’s a simple graph traversal.  	"advantages"
ArangoDB is really fast using just 464ms in AVG, no graph database comes close.  	"advantages"
That’s because lookups in a graph of a known length is faster with an Index lookup than using outbound links in every vertex. 	"advantages"
The test results show that ArangoDB can compete with leading databases in their fields and also with the other multi-model database, OrientDB.  	"advantages"
Memory is our pain point when compared to other systems and it will be addressed in the next major release.  	"advantages"
With a flexible data model, you can use a multi-model database in many different situation without the need to learn new technologies. A short selection of real life tasks has been given here. 	"advantages"
much faster as MRF loss is the slowest part of the algorithm. 	"advantages"
`dendrogram` more elegantly handles extremely large datasets by simply flipping to a horizontal configuration. 	"advantages"
the default and requires less GPU memory but is less accurate then brute. 	"advantages"
One of the fastest Python frameworks available 	"advantages"
These and similar large projects are supported much more actively by a larger number of contributors. 	"advantages"
Tron Virtual Machine (TVM) allow anyone to develop decentralized applications (DAPPs) for themselves or their communities with smart contracts thereby making decentralized crowdfunding and token issuance easier than ever.\r 	"advantages"
**Please note**: This method is less efficient than `observeNetworkConnectivity(context)` method, because in default observing strategy, it opens socket connection with remote host (default is www.google.com) every two seconds with two seconds of timeout and consumes data transfer. 	"advantages"
Increasing this number will slightly improve the performance, but also cause training to be less stable. 	"advantages"
A key-value store is the basis for more complex systems such as a document store, and in some cases, a graph database. 	"advantages"
If you know of a better method, let me know (or even better open a pull request)! 	"advantages"
This utility will help to pull messages from Kafka using Spark Streaming and have better handling of the Kafka Offsets and handle failures. 	"advantages"
This is helpful for more sophisticated visualizations in which configuration is meaningful, e.g. 	"advantages"
Included below are hyper parameters to get equivalent or better results to those included in the original paper. 	"advantages"
Realm is faster than even raw SQLite on common operations while maintaining an extremely rich feature set. 	"advantages"
The Completer API is a much more powerful way to integrate with YCM and it. 	"advantages"
Open Source means: No backdoors, control is better than trust. 	"advantages"
BlurKit is faster than other blurring libraries due to a number of bitmap retrieval and drawing optimizations. 	"advantages"
This is faster than `Affine`. 	"advantages"
The library is faster than other libraries on most of the transformations. 	"advantages"

It is bigger than your average tutorial and smaller than an actual book. 	"advantages"
There are many implementations of sorts in the Java standard library that are much better for performance reasons. 	"advantages"

Download best format available but no better than 480p 	"advantages"
Remote calls are usually slower and less reliable than local calls so it is helpful to distinguish RPC calls from local calls. 	"advantages"
the configuration files are now much smaller than before. 	"advantages"
It is more complex to implement write-behind than it is to implement cache-aside or write-through. 	"advantages"
Here is a slightly more complex example that launches a registry on port 5000, using an Amazon S3 bucket to store images with a custom path, and enables the search endpoint. 	"advantages"
Sharding adds more hardware and additional complexity. 	"advantages"
Fail-over adds more hardware and additional complexity. 	"advantages"
the queue size can become larger than memory. 	"advantages"
Putting it in the hands of junior developers may cause more harm than good. 	"advantages"
Adding a classfier to trained with conditions and constraint G works faster and better than appending conditions to images for D training. 	"advantages"
It provides a simpler and more interactive SQL interface for stream processing on Kafka if compared with other solutions. 	"advantages"
