"licensing"
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. 	"licensing"
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE. 	"licensing"
CC0 1.0 Universal  Statement of Purpose  The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work"). 	"licensing"
Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. 	"licensing"
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others. 	"licensing"
For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights. 	"licensing"
Copyright and Related Rights. 	"licensing"
A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). 	"licensing"
Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following: . the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work, i. 	"licensing"
moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s), ii. 	"licensing"
publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work, v. 	"licensing"
rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below, . rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work, i. 	"licensing"
database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive), and ii. 	"licensing"
other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof. 	"licensing"
To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). 	"licensing"
Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. 	"licensing"
Public License Fallback. 	"licensing"
Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. 	"licensing"
In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). 	"licensing"
The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. 	"licensing"
Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. 	"licensing"
Limitations and Disclaimers. 	"licensing"
No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document. 	"licensing"
b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law. 	"licensing"
c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. 	"licensing"
Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work. 	"licensing"
d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work. 	"licensing"

"licensing"
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 	"licensing"
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. 	"licensing"
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty, and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. 	"licensing"
{one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.} 	"licensing"
Copyright (C) {year}  {name of author}  This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. 	"licensing"
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 	"licensing"
See the GNU General Public License for more details. 	"licensing"
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. 	"licensing"
If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. 	"licensing"
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 	"licensing"
If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:  {project}  Copyright (C) {year}  {fullname} This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, for details type `show w'. 	"licensing"
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions, type `show c' for details. 	"licensing"
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. 	"licensing"
Of course, your program's commands might be different, for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box". 	"licensing"
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. 	"licensing"
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. 	"licensing"
The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. 	"licensing"
If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. 	"licensing"
If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. 	"licensing"
But first, please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>. 	"licensing"
