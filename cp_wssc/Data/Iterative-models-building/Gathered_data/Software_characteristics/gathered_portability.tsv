Portability in high-level computer programming is the usability of the same software in different environments. 	"portability"
The prerequirement for portability is the generalized abstraction between the application logic and system interfaces. 	"portability"
Portability, in relation to software, is a measure of how easily an application can be transferred from one computer environment to another. 	"portability"
Being able to move software from one machine platform to another.  	"portability"
It refers to system software or application software that can be recompiled for a different platform or to software that is available for two or more different platforms.  	"portability"
An application that can be converted from one computer environment to another. 	"portability"
An application that can be easily moved from one computer to another.  	"portability"
With regards to Windows apps, such programs would not use the Registry.  	"portability"
In a totally portable application, all related files would be stored in a single folder so it can be copied with one command or one drag and drop.  	"portability"
The folder would likely have many subfolders, and they would all copy in the same transaction. 	"portability"
An application stored on a USB flash drive that can run on a computer without leaving any trace of itself when the application is finished.  	"portability"
It is designed to restore all changed settings when the program is closed.  	"portability"
Non portable USB applications are typically dependent on a particular brand of USB drive. 	"portability"
To translate software to run in a different computer environment. For example, "port the application to Unix" means make the necessary changes in the program's source code so that it can be compiled and run under the Unix operating system. 	"portability"
Most software developers agree that portability is a desirable attribute for their software projects. 	"portability"
The useful life of an application, for example, is likely to be extended, and its user base increased, if it can be migrated to various platforms over its lifetime.  	"portability"
In spite of the recognized importance of portability, there is little guidance for the systematic inclusion of portability considerations in the development process. 	"portability"
The concept of software portability has different meanings to different people.  	"portability"
According to some definitions, software is portable only if the executable files can be run on a new platform without change.  	"portability"
Others may feel that a significant amount of restructuring at the source level is still consistent with portability.  	"portability"
A software unit is portable (exhibits portability) across a class of environments to the degree that the cost to transport and adapt it to a new environment in the class is less than the cost of redevelopment. 	"portability"
Portability is not a binary attribute.  	"portability"
We consider that each software unit has a quantifiable degree of portability to a particular environment or class of environments, based on the cost of porting.  	"portability"
Note that the degree of portability is not an absolute; it has meaning only with respect to a specific environment or class. 	"portability"
There are both costs and benefits associated with developing software in a portable manner. These costs and benefits take a variety of forms. 	"portability"
We distinguish two major phases of the application porting process. 	"portability"
Transportation and adaptation. Adaptation includes most of the modifications that need to be made to the original software, including automated retranslation.  	"portability"
Transportation refers to the physical movement of the software and associated artifacts, but also includes some low level issues of data representation. 	"portability"
The alternative to porting software to a new environment is redeveloping it based on the original specifications. 	"portability"
There are many hardware and software platforms; it is not only a Windows world. 	"portability"
Users who move to different environments want familiar software. 	"portability"
But not all processors enforce scatar data items aligned at memory addresses that are even multiples of their own size, to the chagrin of nonportable software. 	"portability"
Portable software could simply not rely on ANSI C being widely available - GNU C was not yet mature - and it was often an agonizing tradeoff on just how much of ANSI C could be use. 	"portability"
Most software porters created portability macros that allowed the use of many of these features in code that could be straight K&R or ANSI. 	"portability"
The "build environment" is the set of all software and tools required to go from "source code" to "delivered product". 	"portability"
In addition, it's often simply not possible to "work around" an issue with an operating system in the same way that conditional compilation can resolve one with the compiler. 	"portability"
When considering a port to entirely different operating systems these issues become much larger.  	"portability"
Though the ANSI C library is highly portable across all supported platforms. 	"portability"
Only after solving these problems many times does one start to take pre-emptive action to engineer portability in from the very start. 	"portability"
One approach to the problem of portable software is the design of a universal, hypothetical computer and the implementation of a simulator of the hypothetical computer on the actual machines under consideration. 	"portability"
The notion of software portability was confined to some research projects in universities. It has now become relevant, in some cases even vital, to the economical development of software in practice.  	"portability"
Portability is a characteristic attributed to a computer program if it can be used in an operating systems other than the one in which it was created without requiring major rework.  	"portability"
Porting is the task of doing any work necessary to make the computer program run in the new environment.  	"portability"
In general, programs that adhere to standard program interfaces are portable.  	"portability"
Ideally, such a program needs only to be compiled for the operating system to which it is being ported.  	"portability"
However, programmers using standard interfaces also sometimes use operating system extensions or special capabilities that may not be present in the new operating system.  	"portability"
Uses of such extensions have to be removed or replaced with comparable functions in the new operating system. 	"portability"
In addition to language differences, porting may also require data conversion and adaptation to new system procedures for running an application. 	"portability"
Portability has usually meant some work when moving an application program to another operating system.  	"portability"
Recently, the Java programming language and runtime environment has made it possible to have programs that run on any operating system that supports the Java standard (from Sun Microsystems) without any porting work.  	"portability"
Java applets in the form of precompiled bytecode can be sent from a server program in one operating system to a client program (your Web browser) in another operating system without change. 	"portability"

The Apache Portable Runtime Library provides a predictable and consistent interface to underlying platform-specific implementations, with an API to which software developers may code and be assured of predictable if not identical behavior regardless of the platform on which their software is built, relieving them of the need to code special-case conditions to work around or take advantage of platform-specific deficiencies or features. 	"portability"
This repo contains .NET Portability Analyzer libraries and tools. 	"portability"
The first goal of these tools are to help identify APIs that are not portable among the various .NET Platforms. 	"portability"
These include Microsoft supported platforms (Windows, Windows apps, DNX) as well as other implementations, such as Mono and Xamarin. Some APIs may be removed on certain platforms (such as AppDomains, File I/O, etc.), or refactored into other types (such as some Reflection APIs). 	"portability"
Most of these are considered benign changes that shouldn't affect most applications; however, we understand that what may be low impact for one scenario may be a very impactful breaking change for another. 	"portability"
