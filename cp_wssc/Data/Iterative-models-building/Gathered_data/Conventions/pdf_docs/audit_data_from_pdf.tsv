leds have attracted interest in the climate negotiations as a soft alternative to voluntary or obligatory ghg emission reduction targets in developing countries ecn .	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
the initial proposal to introduce leds was put forward by the eu in  highlighting how information on planned low carbon pathways can help to inform the international community about funding needs and priorities and to help gauge the level of global climate change action oecd iea.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
the concept has been included in the negotiating texts under the unfccc since the run up to cop in copenhagen in and is part of both the copenhagen accord unfccc  and the cancun agreements unfccc   which recognize that a leds is indispensible to sustainable development and that incentives are required to support the development of such strategies in developing countries.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
though not clearly implied by the terminology leds are understood to also include provisions to reduce vulnerability to climate change impacts.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
the discourse of integrating climate change and development builds on a large body of literature which was assessed by the ipcc in its fourth assessment report sathaye et al.   and distinguished between the traditional climate first approach and a development first approach odi .	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
the concept of low carbon development takes a development first approach which rethinks development planning and proposes structural solutions such as alternative infrastructure and spatial planning with lower emission trajectories morita et al.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
it focuses on addressing and integrating climate change with development objectives and is therefore a more useful approach for developing countries.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
in practice the plans are often combinations of new and existing elements all combined in a new way to address pre existing policy objectives along with the need to slow climate change and prepare for its impacts.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
outside of the unfccc the concept has also gained recognition and support by world leaders including at the major economies forum in italy in july where leaders declared that their countries would prepare low carbon growth plans.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model

 united nations. a guide to the green economy. a critique of emerging concepts whilst the concepts of green economy green growth and low carbon development have emerged from different sources through the work of different organisations and with different target audiences the distinctions among them have become blurred and they are now being used almost interchangeably.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
a main driver behind the development of these concepts has been the move towards a more integrated and holistic approach to incorporating environment and development in economic decision making policy and planning.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
whilst the terms green economy and green growth might imply a strong focus on the intersection between environment and the economy many of the definitions of these terms from recent publications clearly also incorporate a social emphasis see appendix.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
a summary of key words from the full list of definitions in appendix is provided in table below categorised according to the three dimensions of sustainable development.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model

whilst this analysis is illustrative there is clearly significant overlap between the two concepts including language around growth and economic development environmental protection low carbon development resilience resource efficiency ecological sustainability human well being inclusiveness and equity.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
in this regard low carbon development can be seen as a subset of both green growth and green economy.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
importantly many definitions of green economy include a united nations. a guide to the green economy reference to ecological limits or planetary boundaries which are references to the scientific article which identifies nine planetary boundaries that define the safe operating space for humanity with respect to the earth system and associated with the planet s biophysical subsystems or processes see rockstrom et al .	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
interestingly this reference has not been included in definitions of green growth.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
the international chamber of commerce propose a key difference between green growth and green economy i.e.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
that green growth is a bottom up approach of greening products processes services technologies and supply chains compared with the top down approach of green economy which involves strategic macro economic policies addressing systemic challenges.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
others highlight that green growth more so than the multidimensional concept of green economy represents a new global compromise position which may be seen as a weak step forward but one that has the potential to unite many different factions around a goal that many see as transformative atkisson .	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
overall the various definitions of green growth and green economy are generally consistent both having sustainable development as their ultimate objective and being a means to reconcile the economic and environmental pillars without ignoring social aspects world bank .	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
as such the distinction between the terms is probably of little relevance.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
however the approaches to green economy and green growth can be seen to cover a spectrum of different shades of green  from narrow concerns about climate change on the one hand in line with initial approaches to low carbon growth  to larger critiques of the environmental sustainability of modern capitalism on the other green growth leaders .	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
in other words and from a scientific perspective the focus varies between addressing one of the planetary boundaries defined by scientists i.e.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
climate change to more holistically addressing the wider range of resource and ecological limits and the general state of the planet.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
of course green economy has not been without its critics.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
criticisms raised include that the concept should not compete with or displace sustainable development and internationally agreed principles that it implies a focus on environmental and economic dimensions to the detriment of the social dimension that it will lead to the financialisation of nature as well as further concentration of market power and global inequality third world network  lander .	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
other risks associated with green economy include that it may attempt to treat countries in the same manner i.e.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
be based on a one size fits all approach  that it may result in trade protectionism that through it some countries may attempt to gain enhanced market access for their products achieving commercial advantage and that it may place new conditionalities on developing countries for aid loans and debt relief khor .	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
critics have also highlighted its failure to do justice to the interdependent relationship between environment protection and inclusive economic and social development dagupta  khor  third world network .	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
in the context of rio  the relationship of green economy as a means to achieving broader sustainable development and poverty eradication was given a clear emphasis.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
more recent references to an equitable green economy or inclusive green growth are clearly attempting more holistically to integrate the three dimensions of sustainable development for example see the no to the green economy campaign http nogreeneconomy.org en united nations. a guide to the green economy into these concepts to allay these concerns.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
however it has also been pointed out that whilst this has been an important development if one follows this track the green economy concept would incorporate so many additional aspects that the concept would become equivalent to sustainable development itself in that sense why bother condezey .	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
perhaps a key benefit of the emergence of the green economy concept has been that it has stimulated international attention and renewed global efforts to transform our current unsustainable economic model into one which better aligns with the overarching goals of sustainable development.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
importantly this has included efforts by international organizations major groups think tanks and researchers both supporters and critics alike to develop operational principles for green economy and green growth as well as the elaboration of policy toolkits and suites of measures that can be adopted by national governments to shift to a more sustainable economic framework.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
there is also an emerging international practice as national governments in all regions adopt what could be classified as green economy policies with some countries taking a leading role in developing overarching national green economy strategies that integrate with long term development strategies.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
in this regard the green economy and related concepts have succeeded in reinvigorating global debate on how to redefine our economic model to achieve the overarching agreed goal of sustainable development.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
it is likely that the concepts of green economy and green growth will further converge in coming years and continue to gather momentum as more influential international organizations as well as national governments adopt the concepts into their programs and policy agendas.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
during this process it will be critical that proponents of green economy effectively take onboard the concerns raised and address the risks associated with the concept.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
the development of agreed green economy principles policy toolkits and databases of good practice will contribute in this regard.	green	pdf	0	Not_from_Model
