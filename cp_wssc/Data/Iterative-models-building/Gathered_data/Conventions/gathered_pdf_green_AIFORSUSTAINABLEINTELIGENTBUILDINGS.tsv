according to a report by the international renewable energy industry institute based in germany the total levels of global greenhouse gas emissions reached a record high in at billion tons.	pdf_green
china accounts for the lion s share with. billion tons.	pdf_green
the united states places second at. billion tons with india ranking third with. billion tons followed by russia at. billion tons japan with. billion tons and germany at million tons.	pdf_green
with climate change affecting everything from weather patterns to satellite operation governments and international organizations are becoming increasingly concerned over man s influence over the environment.	pdf_green
a report released by the world bank titled turn down the heat details the devastating impacts of a world in crisis.	pdf_green
if current policies and trends continue the planet could become an average of degrees celsius. degrees fahrenheit hotter by the end of the century.	pdf_green
this scenario would result in a new normal of extreme temperatures massive flooding and devastation among the poorest nations.	pdf_green
 literature review an intelligent building is one in which the building fabric space services and information systems can respond in an efficient manner to the initial and changing demands of the owner the occupier and the environment.	pdf_green
high performance green buildings are energy and resource efficient non wasteful and non polluting highly flexible and adaptable for long term functionality they are easy to operate and maintain and are supportive of the productivity and wellbeing of the occupants traugott.	pdf_green
an intelligent building is a highly resource efficient technologically advanced structure that provides a responsive support and effective environment for optimal performance and can accommodate future changes in use.	pdf_green
the future drivers for intelligent buildings are likely to be information and communication technologies robotics smart materials sustainable issues technology and social change.in intelligent buildings typical examples of resource efficiency security monitoring fire detection and access control in intelligent buildings include light switches off automatically when no one is in the space permission must be obtained from the owner before a visitor can enter designated spaces.	pdf_green
 if there is an emergency such as a bomb blast the building commences emergency procedures by auto contacting the authorities securing the safety and well being of occupants and extinguishing fire or any other threat including gun fire.	pdf_green
 voice activated commands wireless network systems huge quantum processing computer power.	pdf_green
windapo and rotimi established that the approach to construction by industry stakeholders in nigeria does not match sustainable principles and contributes to general under performance of buildings.	pdf_green
their study revealed that. of reported cases of collapsed buildings in nigeria from to were residential buildings.	pdf_green
green sustainable buildings have existed for years in advanced nations.	pdf_green
intelligent buildings based on advanced technologies have also existed for years in developed nations.	pdf_green
yet the rate of global warming continues at an alarming rate.	pdf_green
it is when there is a global vision based on internet of things iot that intelligent buildings can collectively begin to make a positive impact on the built environment.	pdf_green
 for example an internet based website called inhabitat stated on th january  that delhi s air pollution was even worse than beijing s smog.	pdf_green
it noted that china gets all the attention when it comes to terrible air quality but the truth is that the worst day in beijing is really just an average day in delhi.	pdf_green
though it gets far less notice the air in delhi is some of the most polluted on the planet.	pdf_green
in fact india s citizens have some of the weakest lungs highest rates of asthma and highest mortality rates from respiratory issues of any nation in the world.	pdf_green
in january  beijing closed major highways and issued urgent health warnings to those living within its borders.	pdf_green
on the other hand life in delhi has gone on like normal despite the fact that on average the city s harmful air particulates are nearly double that of beijing.	pdf_green
delhi averaged a measurement of  while beijing averaged. but that s just an average day beijing reached its worst day a measurement of above the highest range that the scale can reach on january. delhi on the other hand had reached that measurement range times by mid january.	pdf_green
even more concerning delhi s peak pollution levels have increased over the past year.	pdf_green
in the past researchers have assumed that the indian s diminished air capacity was genetic but studies show that children of indian immigrants born and raised in the us have better lung function than those born and raised in india.	pdf_green
even more shocking about half of all doctor visits in india are related to respiratory problems.	pdf_green
the issue has gotten so bad that some wealthy citizens are actually considering leaving the country.	pdf_green
some citizens however when interviewed by the new york times claimed to be unaware of the city s pollution problem.	pdf_green
with little pressure on the government to resolve air quality issues from citizens or the media delhi s air will continue to cause harm until people demand something better.	pdf_green
. technologies for intelligent buildings cattell suggested that there was crystallized intelligence breadth and depth of knowledge and skills and fluid intelligence ability to reason quickly without specific reference and distinguish patterns of relationships.	pdf_green
sternberg has tried to identify cognitive process that underly cognitive abilities and has narrowed down multiple intelligences to just three analytic creative and practical.	pdf_green
success in creating ai would be the biggest event in human history wrote stephen hawking in an op ed which appeared in the independent in. emotion and social skills play two roles for an intelligent agent or machine.	pdf_green
first it must be able to predict the actions of others by understanding their motives and emotional states.	pdf_green
this involves elements of game theory decision theory as well as the ability to model human emotions and the perceptual skills to detect emotions.	pdf_green
also in an effort to facilitate human computer interaction an intelligent machine might want to be able to display emotions even if it does not actually experience them itself in order to appear sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction.	pdf_green
a straightforward specific task like machine translation requires that the machine read and write in both languages nlp  follow the author s argument reason  know what is being talked about knowledge  and faithfully reproduce the author s intention social intelligence.	pdf_green
machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors such as cameras microphones tactile sensors sonar and others more exotic to deduce aspects of the world.	pdf_green
computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.	pdf_green
a few selected sub problems are speech recognition facial recognition and object recognition.	pdf_green
affective computing is the study and development of systems and devices that can recognize interpret process and simulate human affects.	pdf_green
these are aspects of artificial intelligence for buildings.	pdf_green
nanotechnology is the engineering of functional systems at the molecular scale.	pdf_green
it refers to the means and ability to construct items from the bottom up using techniques and tools being developed today to make complete high performance products.	pdf_green
one nanometer nm is one billionth or  of a meter.	pdf_green
by comparison typical carbon carbon bond lengths or the spacing between these atoms in a molecule are in the range.. nm and a dna double helix has a diameter around nm.	pdf_green
on the other hand the smallest cellular life forms the bacteria of the genus mycoplasma are around nm in length.	pdf_green
by convention nanotechnology is taken as the scale range to nm following the definition used by the national nanotechnology initiative in the us.	pdf_green
the lower limit is set by the size of atoms hydrogen has the smallest atoms which are approximately a quarter of one nm diameter since nanotechnology must build its devices from atoms and molecules.	pdf_green
materials reduced to the nanoscale can show different properties compared to what they exhibit on a macroscale enabling unique applications.	pdf_green
for instance opaque substances can become transparent copper stable materials can turn combustible aluminum insoluble materials may become soluble gold.	pdf_green
a material such as gold which is chemically inert at normal scales can serve as a potent chemical catalyst at nanoscales.	pdf_green
much of the fascination with nanotechnology stems from these quantum and surface phenomena that matter exhibits at the nanoscale.	pdf_green
nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications such as in medicine electronics biomaterials and energy production.	pdf_green
most applications are limited to the use of first generation passive nanomaterials which includes titanium dioxide in sunscreen cosmetics surface coatings and some food products carbon allotropes used to produce gecko tape silver in food packaging clothing disinfectants and household appliances zinc oxide in sunscreens and cosmetics surface coatings paints and outdoor furniture varnishes and cerium oxide as a fuel catalyst.	pdf_green
the japanese manufacturer toto uses a thin film of titanium dioxide to coat the surface of the wash hand basins and toilet bowls they produce to minimize the surface tension thus reducing the possibility of particles adhering to the surface.	pdf_green
this film can also be used to prevent the steaming up of mirrors and tiles and to prevent condensation droplets forming on the surface.	pdf_green
since active glass has been available from pilkington s. surface grime is broken down by a daylight activated reaction with a surface coating of titanium dioxide.	pdf_green
the glass is also hydrophilic which means that water spreads across it rather than forming droplets and thus can take the dirt with it.	pdf_green
rain effectively can thus clean the glass.	pdf_green
nanotechnology has led to developments in in the science of photonics.	pdf_green
this is linked with opto electronics and production facilities to make fiber optic communication and switching devices.	pdf_green
the building information model bim is primarily a three dimensional digital representation of a building and its intrinsic characteristics.	pdf_green
it is made of intelligent building components which includes data attributes and parametric rules for each object.	pdf_green
for instance a door of certain material and dimension is parametrically related and hosted by a wall.	pdf_green
furthermore bim provides consistent and coordinated views and representations of the digital model including reliable data for each view.	pdf_green
this saves a lot of designer s time since each view is coordinated through the built in intelligence of the model.	pdf_green
according to the national bim standard building information model is a digital representation of physical and functional characteristics of a facility and a shared knowledge resource for information about a facility forming a reliable basis for decisions during its life cycle defined as existing from earliest conception to demolition.	pdf_green
it is the process and practice of virtual design and construction throughout its lifecycle.	pdf_green
it is a platform to share knowledge and communicate between project participants.	pdf_green
high quality d renderings of a building can be generated from building information models.	pdf_green
a collaborative bim approach enables the sharing of the model between the engineer architect construction manager and subcontractors.	pdf_green
at the bim meetings the construction manager and subcontractor can provide their expert construction knowledge to the design team.	pdf_green
moreover the construction manager can use the building information models to generate constructability reports coordinate plan schedule and cost estimate.	pdf_green
traditional design bid build design build and integrated project delivery ipd methods are popular project delivery approaches that the industry currently practices.	pdf_green
no matter which delivery approach is chosen the general contractor or the construction manager can use bim.	pdf_green
construction managers or general contractors can use bim to extract quantities of work to prepare cost estimates.	pdf_green
furthermore they can provide powerful d renderings.	pdf_green
moreover schedule integrated bim known as d bim can be used for simulations animations safety analysis and to prepare site logistic plans.	pdf_green
construction managers can use bim to coordinate work with subcontractors.	pdf_green
they can also update schedule and costs with bim.	pdf_green
lastly they can turn over an as built building information model to the owner s maintenance team.	pdf_green
in the traditional approach the design bid and build phases follow each other.	pdf_green
the architect typically the lead designer in building projects and construction manager works directly for the owner.	pdf_green
the engineering consultants are part of the designer s team.	pdf_green
the engineer and the architect first design the building.	pdf_green
upon the completion of the design phase the construction managers also known as general contractors in the traditional approach bid for the job.	pdf_green
once the bid is awarded then the construction starts.	pdf_green
it is not a fast track project delivery method.	pdf_green
in other words the approach does not involve early participation of the construction team during design.	pdf_green
if the designers generated a d parametric model for the project the bim will lack the knowledge of the contractors during the design phase.	pdf_green
overall design bid build eliminates the benefits of having the construction input during design phase when the ability to influence the cost is the highest.	pdf_green
the architects and the engineers may not want to share their models due to risks liability concerns unauthorized reuse of intellectual properties and misinterpretation of the information included in the model.	pdf_green
lean construction is a system of maximizing value improving efficiency enhancing quality ensuring cost effectiveness and reducing waste in a building project.	pdf_green
it accomplishes these objectives through the use of supply chain management scm and just in time jit techniques as well as the open sharing of information between all the parties involved in the production process.	pdf_green
womack and jones identified the key principles for lean construction systems.	pdf_green
they are value there is a need to clarify the customer s needs and the agents involved in all stages from inception to the delivery process in order to clarify activities or products that signify value.	pdf_green
 value stream by mapping the whole value stream establishing cooperation between the participants and identifying and eliminating waste the construction process can be improved.	pdf_green
 flow business flow includes project information specifications contracts plans etc.	pdf_green
job site flow involves the activities and the way they have to be done.	pdf_green
 supply flow the materials used in a project.	pdf_green
 pull the efforts of all participants stabilize pulls during the construction process.	pdf_green
 perfection work instructions procedures are developed quality controls are established.	pdf_green
four main principles of lean construction system minimal use of building materials.	pdf_green
 minimal cost for affordability.	pdf_green
 maximum quality of building.	pdf_green
 minimal wastage of building materials and energy.	pdf_green
these principles are examined from the design stage and through the whole management process.	pdf_green
a holistic approach instead of the usual practice where design management and lean construction are examined separately should be adopted.	pdf_green
today s prefabrication industry is currently under the pressures to produce a more flexible manufacturing technology along with prefabricated systems that allow entire structures to be constructed out of a single system of parts evans june .	pdf_green
the critical aspects in achieving more efficient buildings lies in the wall construction details the method of connecting building components to the walls and the type of building materials used.	pdf_green
the thickness of the walls and the type of materials used for wall construction will affect the size design flexibility and cost of each space.	pdf_green
for example ballard and howell designed the last planner system as one method for applying lean techniques to construction.	pdf_green
it provides productive unit and workflow controls and facilitates quick response to correct for deviations from expected outcomes by using root cause analysis.	pdf_green
control is defined as causing events to conform to plan as opposed to the construction tradition of monitoring progress against schedule and budget projections.	pdf_green
the last planner is based on three levels of schedules and planning tools the master pull schedule serves as the overall project schedule as contrasted with the detailed critical path schedule that is the more traditional management tool.	pdf_green
in some cases a critical path chart may also be used.	pdf_green
 the look ahead schedule reflects major work items that need to be completed for the milestone dates in the master pull schedule to be met.	pdf_green
this schedule is usually based on a six to eight week time frame and uses items pulled from the master pull schedule they are carefully reviewed to ensure that they are free of constraints that cannot be removed within a given time.	pdf_green
 the weekly planner schedule delineates the work activities or assignments pulled from the look ahead schedule that must be initiated to meet the completion dates in that schedule.	pdf_green
eligible activities or assignments are those that have no current constraints and that have resources available and assigned.	pdf_green
the so called last planner is the foreman or other professional who prepares the weekly planner schedule.	pdf_green
this schedule also includes a buffer of work activities based on future work.	pdf_green
the weekly accomplishment is measured as percent planned complete ppc.	pdf_green
incorporating these measures into traditional building systems will enhance the quality of monitoring progress and quick response to deviations.	pdf_green
like most industrial processes current construction practices are linear.	pdf_green
they use energy and natural resources convert them to the built environment and discharge waste.	pdf_green
the large quantities of debris left over from demolished buildings are examples of waste from a linear process.	pdf_green
experts recommend a cyclical construction process that puts a greater emphasis on recycled renewed and reused resources.	pdf_green
this approach will be accompanied by reductions in energy and resource use.	pdf_green
the cyclical method could conceivably reuse much of a discarded building to erect a new one in its place.	pdf_green
 proposed methodology we recommend the combined adoption of integrated project delivery ipd and innovative green architecture.	pdf_green
 ipd contractually integrated project delivery ipd is a collaborative alliance of people systems business structures and practices into a process that harnesses the talents and insights of all participants to optimize project results increase value to the owner reduce waste and maximize efficiency through all phases of design fabrication and construction.	pdf_green
there are eight main sequential phases to the integrated project delivery method a conceptualization phase expanded programming  b criteria design phase expanded schematic design c detailed design phase expanded design development  d implementation documents phase construction documents  e agency review phase f buyout phase g construction phase and h closeout phase.	pdf_green
facilities management is the final part.	pdf_green
requires designers construction manager integrated project delivery subcontractors and owners to share the project risks.	pdf_green
if the project stays within budget then all the project participants receive their share of profits.	pdf_green
otherwise they all lose their fee.	pdf_green
this incentive promotes all the participants to work together towards a common goal.	pdf_green
they share all the building information model share decision making and share the responsibility.	pdf_green
this joint project management approach results in pure collaboration and no litigation.	pdf_green
overall building information modeling makes ipd achievable.	pdf_green
the problems in contemporary construction include buildings that are behind schedule and over budget as well as adverse relations among the owner general contractor and architect.	pdf_green
using ideas developed by toyota in their toyota production system and computer technology advances the integrated project delivery method is designed to solve these key construction problems.	pdf_green
the new focus in ipd is the final value created for the owner the finished building.	pdf_green
rather than each participant focusing exclusively on their part of construction without considering the implications on the whole process the ipd method brings all participants together early with collaborative incentives to maximize value for the owner.	pdf_green
this collaborative approach allows informed decision making early in the project where the most value can be created.	pdf_green
the close collaboration eliminates a great deal of waste in the design and allows data sharing directly between the design and construction team eliminating a large barrier to increased productivity in construction.	pdf_green
the first working definition of ipd was established in may by the aia california council integrated project delivery task force comprising representatives of owners architects contractors engineers and lawyers.	pdf_green
integrated project delivery is a delivery system that seeks to align interests objectives and practices even in a single business through a team based approach.	pdf_green
the team primary team members would include the architect key technical consultants as well as a general contractor and key subcontractors.	pdf_green
the ipd system is a process where all disciplines in a construction project work as one firm creating faster delivery times lower costs no litigation and a more enjoyable process for the entire team including the owner.	pdf_green
ipd combines ideas from integrated practice and lean construction to solve several problems in contemporary construction such as low productivity and waste time overruns quality issues and conflicts during construction among the key stakeholders of owner architect and contractor.	pdf_green
the growing use of building information modeling in the construction industry is allowing far greater information collaboration between project participants using ipd and considered an important tool to increasing productivity throughout the construction process.	pdf_green
unlike the design build project delivery method which places the contractor in the leading role on a building project ipd represents a return to the master builder concept where the entire building team including the owner architect contractor engineers and subcontractors work collaboratively throughout the construction process.	pdf_green
however as most construction projects involve disparate stakeholders traditional it solutions are not conducive to collaborative working.	pdf_green
sharing files behind it firewalls large email attachment sizes and the ability to view all manner of file types without the native software all make ipd difficult.	pdf_green
the need to overcome collaborative it challenges has been one of the drivers behind the growth of online construction collaboration technology.	pdf_green
since  a new generation of technology companies evolved using saas to facilitate ipd in a smooth and efficient manner.	pdf_green
this collaboration software streamlines the flow of documentation communications and workflows ensuring everyone is working from one version of the truth.	pdf_green
collaboration software allows users from disparate locations to keep all communications documents drawings forms and data amongst other types of electronic file in one place.	pdf_green
version control is assured and users are able to view and mark up files online without the need for native software.	pdf_green
since  advancement in cloud technology has made some building spaces obsolete while increasing pressure on some strategic older buildings to be redesigned to meet up with demands of the information age.	pdf_green
 innovative green architecture iga is the adaptation of green architecture to the local environment using strategic innovation.	pdf_green
pressures for innovation are usually strongest when there is demand for radically different types of buildings driven by widespread technological and economic change.	pdf_green
the most recent period of such change began in the late s taking hold throughout advanced industrialized countries during the early and mid s because of the need to provide a new infrastructure and facilities to support activities based on the use of information and communication technology gann .	pdf_green
green architecture basically refers to environmentally friendly buildings that are energy efficient.	pdf_green
green architecture may have many of these characteristics ventilation systems designed for efficient heating and cooling.	pdf_green
 energy efficient lighting and appliances.	pdf_green
 water saving plumbing fixtures.	pdf_green
 landscapes planned to maximize passive solar energy.	pdf_green
 minimal harm to the natural habitat.	pdf_green
 alternate power sources such as solar power or wind power.	pdf_green
 non synthetic non toxic materials. responsibly harvested woods and stone.	pdf_green
 adaptive reuse of older buildings.	pdf_green
 use of recycled architectural salvage.	pdf_green
 efficient use of space.	pdf_green
while most green buildings do not have all of these features the highest goal of green architecture is to be fully sustainable.	pdf_green
green architecture is also known as sustainable development eco design eco friendly architecture earth friendly architecture environmental architecture natural architecture.	pdf_green
green building also known as green construction or sustainable building is the practice of creating structures and using processes that are environmentally responsible and resource efficient throughout a building s life cycle design construction operation maintenance renovation and demolition.	pdf_green
this practice expands and complements the classical building design concerns of economy utility durability and comfort.	pdf_green
although new technologies are constantly being developed to complement current practices in creating greener structures the common objective is that green buildings are designed to reduce the overall impact of the built environment on human health and the natural environment by efficiently using energy water and other resources.	pdf_green
 protecting occupant health and improving employee productivity. reducing waste pollution and environmental degradation.	pdf_green
a similar concept is natural building which is usually on a smaller scale and tends to focus on the use of natural materials that are available locally.	pdf_green
sustainable housing helps to address global pollution and rapidly depleted natural resources.	pdf_green
miyatake quotes norway s prime minister sustainability is leaving sufficient resources for future generations to have a quality of life similar to ours.	pdf_green
at the first world conference for sustainable construction dr. charles j. kilbert identified six principles minimize resource consumption maximize resource use use renewable or recyclable resources protect the natural environment create a healthy nontoxic environment and pursue quality in creating the built environment.	pdf_green
at eko atlantic city the following questions are being given to developers to assist them in ensuring that green architecture is fully implemented there.	pdf_green
the questions are based on the point criteria for green architecture by the american institute of architects.	pdf_green
. sustainable design intent innovation. what are the key environmental issues key ecological goals and concepts for eko atlantic city. how were these goals and concepts expressed in the design of eko atlantic city. what sustainable design innovations are there in eko atlantic. based on your process of program analysis what are the resource efficiencies realized by innovative programming.	pdf_green
. what efforts to right size the project and to reduce unnecessary square footage.	pdf_green
these are goods services and inventions such electricity computers and motor vehicles.	pdf_green
in view of this strategic innovation is essential in bringing together the five concepts in this study to support the optimal development of artificial intelligence in intelligent buildings.	pdf_green
 observe real people in real life situations.	pdf_green
 visualize new to the world concepts and the customers who will use them.	pdf_green
 evaluate and refine prototypes implement the new concept tom kelly the art of innovation.	pdf_green
the figure below illustrates key concepts.	pdf_green
the literature reviews have shown that the techniques used in accessing new technologies can be more sustainable if the innovative thinking is extended into the realms of sustainability.	pdf_green
the simple analogy is that when green architecture is applied innovatively by professionals using integrated project delivery a sustainable foundation is laid on which advanced technology can thrive.	pdf_green
nanotechnology building information modelling and lean construction are already forms of innovation.	pdf_green
however what makes them sustainable in intelligent buildings is the innovative way green architecture has been applied from the onset.	pdf_green
 conclusion and further research the research findings in this study revealed the importance of laying a sustainable foundation for advanced technologies in intelligent buildings based on green architecture and integrated project delivery.	pdf_green
this should be done before nanotechnology building information modelling and lean construction can be applied with artificial intelligence to achieve intelligent buildings.	pdf_green
despite the advanced technology and intelligent buildings present in developed countries the problem of global warming is still a major issue.	pdf_green
in africa we must therefore ensure that advanced technologies in the form of artificial intelligence and intelligent buildings are first examined in terms of sustainability using green architecture.	pdf_green
integrated project delivery also ensures that the various forms of information documented in building information modelling and lean construction are properly implemented through the involvement of various types of professionals at conceptual stage.	pdf_green
for example information technology experts are now part of the integral design team from conception stage.	pdf_green
eko atlantic city as a case study revealed that the great wall of lagos sea revetment which is being built more than two kilometres offshore is now protecting over million square meters of eko atlantic city and victoria island.	pdf_green
the threat of serious flooding was a major concern.	pdf_green
before the great wall tidal surges used to regularly cause water and debris to spill over on to the main coastal highway named ahmadu bello way.	pdf_green
developers of the new city plan to use eco friendly building materials and advanced technologies during its construction.	pdf_green
further research should reveal the nature of intelligent buildings and extent of integrated project delivery on the site when the first buildings are completed.	pdf_green
