unep defines a green economy as one that results in improved human well being and social equity while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities.	pdf_green
the concept of a green economy has its origins in discussions around environment and development that led to the discussion and promotion of the term sustainable development at the united nations conference on environment and development unced in rio de janeiro known also as the rio summit or earth summit.	pdf_green
the term was revived and entered the international development discourse following the global financial crisis of  as national governments and international organizations grappled with ways to reboot the economy in a more sustainable way.	pdf_green
several countries launched green stimulus programmes which were essentially public sector incentive packages for private investment in green energy sources and technologies.	pdf_green
unep was an early champion launching its ge initiative in october. the ge concept has also resonated in climate change mitigation discussions and it has become an important theme in the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc negotiations.	pdf_green
the concept of a green economy is related to the ideas of green growth and low carbon development as shown in the table below.	pdf_green
it focuses on the synergies and tradeoffs between the environmental and economic pillars of sustainable development green growth knowledge platform low carbon development strategies are forward looking national economic development plans or strategies that encompass low emission and or climate resilient economic growth oecd the concept of a green economy supports and does not replace sustainable development.	pdf_green
but this new focus responds to two recent developments there is a deeper appreciation today by many governments companies civil society and the public that we are reaching planetary limits not just in terms of greenhouse gas emissions but also in our use of water land forests and other natural resources.	pdf_green
the environmental and social costs of our current economic model are becoming more and more apparent.	pdf_green
the global recession has led to a reconsideration of key tenets of the current economic model and adoption by a number of countries of programmes to promote green energy sources and to develop new markets and industries that can create good long term jobs the promotion of a green economy was a key theme at the rio conference held in june to mark the th anniversary of the rio summit.	pdf_green
governments agreed at rio to frame the green economy as an important tool for sustainable development one that is inclusive and can drive economic growth employment and poverty eradication whilst maintaining the healthy functioning of the earth s ecosystems.	pdf_green
principles of a green economy while definitions are useful for interpretation of the green economy concept there has been an attempt to move beyond simple definitions of the green economy to define a set of guiding principles.	pdf_green
these principles help to guide practitioners in the application of the green economy concept.	pdf_green
 http sustainabledevelopment.un.org index.php menu  p a g e a number of sets of green economy principles were published by a variety of organizations in the lead up to rio. an analysis of eight sets of principles was conducted by the united nations division for sustainable development that year undesa .	pdf_green
it found that there is a considerable diversity of principles that have been proposed to enhance interpretation and application of the green economy.	pdf_green

rationale for transitioning to a green economy in the caribbean major issues in the caribbean a green economy approach is expected to address the major problems affecting caribbean countries and lead toward sustainable development with its triple goals of economic social and environmental welfare in the region.	pdf_green
poverty and social inequality per capita income ranges widely from us  in trinidad and tobago to only us in haiti canari .	pdf_green
many countries are classified as middle income  but with wide and growing economic disparities.	pdf_green
for example st. vincent and the grenadines saint lucia and jamaica are all estimated to have poverty rates of around per cent.	pdf_green
levels of poverty and near poverty have increased with the current economic crisis with declining educational performance also contributing to rapidly increasing rates of unemployment.	pdf_green
poverty is often linked to issues of social inequality.	pdf_green
the region has a large percentage of female headed households many below or close to the poverty line.	pdf_green
underproductive domestic sectors and dependence on volatile external markets have contributed to the persistence of poverty in the region.	pdf_green
 p a g e loss of is expected to disaster risk the region is highly vulnerable to natural hazards including hurricanes earthquakes volcanic landslides which have eruptions floods and caused tremendous life as well as environmental social and economic impacts in some cases approaching per cent of gdp as in the case of grenada and the cayman islands after the passage of hurricane ivan in.	pdf_green
climate change increase the frequency and intensity of hurricanes droughts and other climate related hazards.	pdf_green
public indebtedness levels of public debt have increased rapidly in recent years with combined external and domestic debt ranging from over per cent to nearly per cent.	pdf_green
the cost of debt servicing has been eroding state capacity making this economic crisis feel especially acute.	pdf_green
the burden of the adjustments that have been made to public services has been largely felt by those who need the services the most thus contributing to further poverty and social inequity.	pdf_green
diminishing sectoral benefits returns from key economic sectors have been decreasing.	pdf_green
in the tourism industry growth now brings only marginal net benefits to the region largely because of the sector s heavy reliance on imported goods and services.	pdf_green
the agricultural industry vital to the rural economy has been neglected.	pdf_green
in the energy sector unsustainable consumption and lack of investment are shrinking the benefit cost ratio even in oil producing countries such as trinidad and tobago.	pdf_green
recent emphasis on sustainable tourism  sustainable agriculture  and sustainable energy provide positive platforms for addressing problems in these sectors.	pdf_green
climate change impacts small island states have been identified by the unfccc as among the most vulnerable to climate change particularly the impacts from sea level rise and increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes.	pdf_green
the anticipated impact of climate change on the caribbean is highly disproportionate to the region s small contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions.	pdf_green
climate change poses a substantial threat to the caribbean s population and infrastructure most of which are in coastal areas which are more vulnerable.	pdf_green
climate change also has significant impacts on key economic sectors particularly tourism and agriculture.	pdf_green
these sectors already suffer periodic collapses following hurricanes and other natural disasters.	pdf_green
coastal erosion has been costly for the tourism industry and sea p a g e level rise will increase the impact.	pdf_green
climate change also poses a threat to scarce potable water resources on many islands.	pdf_green
a study by the caribbean catastrophe risk insurance facility found that annual expected losses from climate related events already amount to per cent to per cent of gdp in some countries and that climate change could increase these losses by to percentage points of gdp by ccrif .	pdf_green
caribbean principles of a green economy the key messages that grew out of the caribbean ge dialogue are shown in the box below key messages from caribbean dialogue on the green economy there is need for a new model of economic development in the caribbean.	pdf_green
a shift to a more resilient and green economic pathway must be built upon a more secure equitable and democratic foundation.	pdf_green
a green economy in the caribbean context aims for long term prosperity through equitable distribution of economic benefits and effective management of ecological resources it is economically viable and resilient self directed self reliant and pro poor.	pdf_green
there are existing opportunities for moving towards a green economy in the caribbean now.	pdf_green
there is need for ongoing dialogue in what a green economy means in the caribbean and how it can be implemented.	pdf_green
these key messages can lead to general characteristics or principles of a green economy that apply across sectors and institutions.	pdf_green
a set of caribbean principles emerged from the regional dialogue which can serve as guidelines for leaders in the public and private sectors when making decisions on how to operationalize a green economy.	pdf_green
ge principles should be developed to meet the needs and vision of each country and each sector.	pdf_green
the goal is not to simply arrive at a list of principles but to engage in discussion with stakeholders about the priorities and approaches to moving toward a green economy.	pdf_green
 p a g e linkages between the economy and the natural environment to fully appreciate the concepts embodied within a green economy it is important to recognize the linkages between the economy and the natural environment.	pdf_green
the above diagram depicts the important relationships between the economy society and the environment.	pdf_green
economic activity defined as the engine of growth of an economy and the basis for the level of well being experienced by a society is dependent on the environment for sources of energy and materials from the environment the environment provides useful sources of energy and materials.	pdf_green
overuse of non renewable sources of energy and natural resources can affect our economic activity.	pdf_green
sinks the ability of the environment to assimilate waste from production processes for waste and pollution environmental services ecological services of nature include water flow regulation climate regulation oxygen production nutrient recycling and waste p a g e assimilation by water air and land radiation protection from the ozone layer.	pdf_green
these are often ignored or undervalued.	pdf_green
space for people infrastructure nature and aesthetics the diagram also shows that once economic activity takes place environmental and social well being.	pdf_green
it affects some ecosystem services the list of benefits provided by nature is vast.	pdf_green
ecosystems provide food fresh water climate and flood regulation and recreational and aesthetic enjoyment.	pdf_green
forests store carbon provide timber and other valuable products as well as habitat to a wide array of species.	pdf_green
wetlands purify water offer protection against floods produce oxygen store carbon dioxide and help to regulate climate.	pdf_green
mangroves protect coasts and coastal populations from storms and tsunamis.	pdf_green
coral reefs provide breeding grounds for fish and attractions for tourists.	pdf_green
rivers provide fish water and facilities for recreation and also other ecosystem functions such as holding and circulating water.	pdf_green
the quantity and quality of waste generated can affect economy activity in two ways waste if not properly managed re enters the environment and can negatively affect the environmental services upon which economic activity depends waste if recycled or reused can re enter the production process as material input and by so doing reduce the strain on the environment to supply additional quantities of materials for the production process.	pdf_green
relationship between environmental ecological well being and economic well being environmental well being contributes to economic well being when the environment is able to properly carry out its functions.	pdf_green
the economic benefits of healthy functioning ecological services nutrient cycling flood control climate control soil productivity forest health pollination and natural pest control underpin the everyday functioning of the environment and many jobs.	pdf_green
economic activity itself does not present a threat to the environment.	pdf_green
it is the speed and scale of this economic activity which presents a threat to the integrity of the environmental support system that underpins economic activity.	pdf_green
the environmental problems that the world is now facing lies fundamentally in the massive expansion of overall economic activities the excessive consumption of resources and the emission of wastes beyond the environment s capacity to assimilate.	pdf_green
while economic activity is essential for the provision of human well being economic activity that does not take into account its effect on the environment through the p a g e overexploitation of materials and the unmanaged generation of wastes will ultimately not only endanger further economic activity but will result in negative impacts to human economic and social well being.	pdf_green
links between the natural environment and three key economic sectors in the caribbean tourism tourism depends on the environmental quality of a destination i.e.	pdf_green
it depends on the natural environment for its wide array of ecosystems for example beaches and coastal areas mountains and forests.	pdf_green
depletion of groundwater as the tourist industry is the single largest consumer of treated water demanding as much as times more than the domestic average p a g e direct and indirect solid waste impacts due to difficulty in siting solid waste disposal facilities and in supporting economically viable recycling programmes agriculture the first and foremost role of agriculture is the production of food.	pdf_green
however agriculture and related land use activity have other functions which can be broadly characterized as follows land use environmental functions agriculture and related influence the natural resource system and can have either beneficial or harmful effects on the environment.	pdf_green
nutrient filtering by mangroves can be likened to oxidation ponds of traditional wastewater treatment plants pest control predator prey populations create a self regulating balance whereby biological inter species competition keeps more pests in check than could ever be accomplished through the use of pesticides.	pdf_green
biodiversity ecosystem stability depends on the results of competition between different species for food and space.	pdf_green
it is this competition that increases species diversity.	pdf_green
pollination  out of  species of flowering plants are pollinated by insects.	pdf_green
carbon sequestration because biomass has the capacity to store carbon where the soil is not tilled or where minimum tillage is practised soil contributes to carbon retention.	pdf_green
 p a g e habitat the provision of space shelter and food for many important macro and microrganisms such as earthworms.	pdf_green
environmental implications of agriculture the pressure to produce enough food has had a worldwide impact on agricultural practices.	pdf_green
in many countries this pressure has resulted in the expansion of agriculture onto marginal lands mainly for subsistence purposes.	pdf_green
in other countries food needs have forced the expansion of irrigation and the steady increase in the use of fertilizers and pesticides in order to achieve and sustain higher yields.	pdf_green
some significant negative effects of conventional agricultural practices include degradation of agricultural land and decline in soil fertility continue to be major threats to food security and sustained agricultural productivity especially in developing countries.	pdf_green
water pollution agriculture is the largest non point source of water pollutants contributing to water pollution for example through the discharge of pollutants fertilizers nitrates and phosphorous and pesticides and sediment to surface and or groundwater nutrient run off has the ability to affect rivers lakes and oceans causing eutrophication and the creation of dead zones.	pdf_green
and while agriculture affects water quality it is also affected by water pollution through the use of wastewater and polluted surface and groundwater which can contaminate crops affect fishery production transmit disease to consumers and farm workers land degradation caused by poor agricultural practices can also affect water resources reducing water availability and quality and altering the regimes of rivers and streams.	pdf_green
 p a g e potential impacts include flooding silting of reservoirs and rivers groundwater depletion salinization of aquifers and pollution of water.	pdf_green
coal oil natural gas are non renewable sources of energy which come from the natural environment.	pdf_green
their increased use requires continuous imports by caribbean countries which do not have their own supplies trinidad tobago being one notable exception.	pdf_green
continued and increasing use of fossil fuels also depends on seeking to exploit new sources which are either located in in environmentally sensitive areas or must use more damaging extraction methods.	pdf_green
natural gas is the most environmentally benign fossil fuel and is relatively cheap to produce.	pdf_green
these two factors have greatly increased the use of natural gas to generate electricity.	pdf_green
natural gas does cause air pollution but not as much as the other fossil fuels.	pdf_green
impacts of energy use the production storage transport and use of energy has effects on human health ecosystems and biodiversity climate change and the economy human health the generation of electricity is responsible for the emission of sulphur dioxide nitrogen dioxide mercury and fine airborne particles resulting in the deterioration of air quality.	pdf_green
nitrogen oxides mercury and fine airborne particles aggravate asthma conditions reduce lung functions and can cause respiratory diseases and premature deaths.	pdf_green
ecosystems and biodiversity the mining drilling and pipeline installation for the supply of energy can disrupt entire ecosystems.	pdf_green
the combustion of fossil fuels emits gaseous pollutants which cause global warming acid rain and smog.	pdf_green
smog can cause damage to crops forest and property as it is formed from the combination of nitrogen oxides and reactive organic gases.	pdf_green
acid rain acidifies the soils and waters which can cause damage to plants fish and the animals that they support.	pdf_green
the extraction of coal from mines can cause severe erosion and the destruction of natural habitats and leaches toxic chemicals into nearby streams and groundwater supplies.	pdf_green
although hydro power is considered to be a clean form of energy the construction of dams facilities has significant environmental impacts.	pdf_green
these include the destruction of entire ecosystems such as rivers having effects on fish and other water species the loss of scenic natural large hydro power for p a g e areas and reduced water flow for other uses.	pdf_green
large dams block the natural flow of water thereby degrading water quality.	pdf_green
however small scale hydro facilities are considered to be an environmentally friendly form of energy.	pdf_green
climate change climate change is caused by many gases referred to as greenhouse gases of which carbon dioxide is the most significant.	pdf_green
energy production results in the emission of per cent of global carbon dioxide.	pdf_green
the two main anthropogenic sources of carbon dioxide emissions are fossil fuel combustion and land use changes mainly deforestation.	pdf_green
energy s contribution to greenhouse gas production is greatest in the high consumption industrialised countries.	pdf_green
economic effects the production of energy from fossil fuels have significant economic impacts that are not reflected in the price of energy itself.	pdf_green
acid rain can cause significant damage to crops forests lakes and buildings and air pollution increases health care costs.	pdf_green
air pollution that has an impact on global warming has a potential cost from flooding and hurricane damage low agriculture yields and population resettlement.	pdf_green
lost productivity due to workers emissions related illnesses also comes at an economic cost to a country.	pdf_green
 p a g e barriers to transitioning to a green economy while the rationale for change is clear and there is an expressed interest in the region in moving toward a green economy there are a number of barriers or challenges to making this transition.	pdf_green
through its work with the ge dialogue in the caribbean canari has identified some primary barriers to transitioning to a ge in the region political disincentives few politicians are prepared to take substantive leadership towards changes that could alienate powerful interest groups that benefit from the current paradigm.	pdf_green
divisive partisan politics in most countries reduces the ability of any government to achieve the political consensus required to make major policy shifts.	pdf_green
weak bottom up demand over the past twenty years the influence of civil society on national and regional development has declined significantly.	pdf_green
some of the roles once played by ngos have been captured by the state and financial support for civil society work has therefore declined.	pdf_green
issues that created a sense of solidarity among civil society and academia in earlier decades are no longer on the table.	pdf_green
few young people are engaging in development action and debate.	pdf_green
as a result civil society organizations are becoming increasingly demoralized and dispersed despite the continued engagement of a few.	pdf_green
declining human resource base the region has for decades suffered from significant brain drain and this is now being compounded by the poor performance of national education systems.	pdf_green
in many countries drop out rates are at all time highs especially for boys and rates of illiteracy and innumeracy are increasing.	pdf_green
for example over per cent of boy school leavers in jamaica failed their qualification exam in mathematics.	pdf_green
most countries also lack any system of training in skills that match the opportunities available.	pdf_green
skilled jobs are often outsourced or filled by persons from outside the country or region and opportunities to add value to existing sectors through enhanced human resources are lost.	pdf_green
outdated and inadequate regulatory frameworks existing legal frameworks and regulations do not encourage improved environmental and economic practices or innovations that could create new sustainable economic opportunities.	pdf_green
in some cases they actually encourage perverse practices.	pdf_green
leadership and p a g e group exercise and discussion do you agree with the barriers identified by canari what are the main barriers to developing a green economy in your country p a g e	pdf_green
