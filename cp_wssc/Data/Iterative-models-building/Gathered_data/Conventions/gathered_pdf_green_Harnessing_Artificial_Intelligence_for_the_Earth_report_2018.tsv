ai is a term for computer systems that can sense their environment think learn and act in response to what they sense and their programmed objectives.	pdfgreen
of all the fourth industrial revolution technologies ai is expected to have the deepest impact permeating all industries and playing an increasing role in daily life.	pdfgreen
by combining with other new technologies ai is becoming the electricity of the fourth industrial revolution as innovators embed intelligence into more devices applications and interconnected systems.	pdfgreen
beyond productivity gains ai also promises to enable humans to develop intelligence not yet reached opening the door to new discoveries.	pdfgreen
harnessing artificial intelligence for the earthai is already transforming traditional industries and everyday lives.	pdfgreen
the focus of this report is on harnessing ai systems today and as they evolve to create maximum positive impact on urgent environmental challenges.	pdfgreen
it suggests ways in which ai can help transform traditional sectors and systems to address climate change deliver food and water security protect biodiversity and bolster human well being.	pdfgreen
this concern is tightly linked with the emerging question of how to ensure that ai does not become harmful to human well being.to develop safe ai the ultimate goal is to ensure that it becomes value aligned that its idea of a good future is aligned with humanity s values promising safe application of the technology for humankind.	pdfgreen
in practice this means that checks and balances developed to ensure that evolving ai systems remain friendly must incorporate the health of the natural environment as a fundamental dimension.	pdfgreen
harnessing artificial intelligence for the earththe ai revolutionwhy now the first practical steps towards artificial intelligence were taken in the s.	pdfgreen
today ai is in use in our daily lives and has reached a historical moment because of six converging factors big data computers have given us access to vast amounts of data both structured in databases and spreadsheets and unstructured such as text audio video and images.	pdfgreen
all of this data documents our lives and improves humans understanding of the world.	pdfgreen
as trillions of sensors are deployed in appliances packages clothing autonomous vehicles and elsewhere big data will only get bigger.	pdfgreen
ai assisted processing of this information allows us to use this data to discover historical patterns predict more efficiently make more effective recommendations and more.	pdfgreen
processing power accelerating technologies such as cloud computing and graphics processing units have made it cheaper and faster to handle large volumes of data with complex ai empowered systems through parallel processing.	pdfgreen
in the future deep learning chips a key focus of research today will push parallel computation further.	pdfgreen
a connected globe social media platforms have fundamentally changed how individuals interact.	pdfgreen
this increased connectivity has accelerated the spread of information and encouraged the sharing of knowledge leading to the emergence of a collective intelligence  including open source communities developing ai tools and sharing applications.	pdfgreen
open source software and data open source software and data are accelerating the democratization and use of ai as can be seen in the popularity of open source machine learning standards and platforms such as tensorflow caffe pytorch and parl.ai.	pdfgreen
an open source approach can mean less time spent on routine coding industry standardization and wider application of emerging ai tools.	pdfgreen
improved algorithms researchers have made advances in several aspects of ai particularly in deep learning  which involves layers of neural networks designed in a fashion inspired by the human brain s approach to processing information.	pdfgreen
another emerging area of research is deep reinforcement in which the ai agent learns with little or no initial input data by trial and error optimized by a reward function.	pdfgreen
accelerating returns competitive pressures have fuelled the rise of ai as businesses have used improved algorithms and open source software to boost their competitive advantage and augment their returns through for example increasing personalization of consumer products or utilizing intelligent automation to increase their productivity.	pdfgreen
the convergence of these factors has helped ai move from in vitro in research labs to in vivo in everyday lives.	pdfgreen
established corporations and start ups alike can now pioneer ai advances and applications.	pdfgreen
indeed many people are already using ai infused systems whether they realize it or not to navigate cities shop online find entertainment recommendations filter out unwanted emails or share a journey to work.ai is already here then and many corporate executives perceive its potential value.	pdfgreen
for example a robot that can learn to sort recycled household materials.	pdfgreen
assisted intelligence systems that review and reveal patterns in historical data such as unstructured social media posts and help people perform tasks more quickly and better by using the information gleaned.	pdfgreen
for example techniques such as deep learning natural language processing and anomaly detection can uncover leading indicators of hurricanes and other major weather events.	pdfgreen
augmented intelligence systems that use ai to help people understand and predict an uncertain future.	pdfgreen
for example ai enabled management simulators can help examine scenarios involving climate policy and greenhouse gas emissions as pioneered by mit s john sterman. autonomous intelligence systems that automate decision making without human intervention.	pdfgreen
for example systems that can identify patterns of high demand and high cost in home heating adapting usage automatically to save a homeowner money.harnessing artificial intelligence for the earthresearch on ai algorithms has been moving quickly especially since big data has been combined with statistical machine learning algorithms.	pdfgreen
narrow task driven ai techniques already important in many industrial applications are now working with big data to allow pattern recognition in unstructured text and images.	pdfgreen
the potential of deep learning using neural network architecture continues to grow as computers become faster and big data becomes ever more prevalent enhancing performance in fields such as language translation and autonomous cars.	pdfgreen
the latest advances in unsupervised deep reinforcement learning from deepmind s alphago zero research show that in certain situations ai can be surprisingly powerful even without input data or labels. in situations where the boundary conditions are known reinforcement learning needs substantially less time and computer processing power than older methods.	pdfgreen
this research also developed an intelligence that was new to humans accelerating the natural selection cycles of intelligence but in machines.	pdfgreen
to date reinforcement learning has been primarily used for ai gaming agents but should also help in corporate strategic analysis process optimization and many other domains where the rules and different states of play are well known.	pdfgreen
however this is often not true for many systems encountered in the real world and a central research priority is to identify the real world systems where reinforcement learning would be most useful.experts expect that supervised and unsupervised learning techniques will become increasingly blended and that such hybrid techniques will open the way for human machine collaborative learning and for ai to develop more advanced human like capabilities.	pdfgreen
figure timeline of ai developmentssource pwcprogress in ai may accelerate as new techniques are developed to overcome existing challenges with machine learning deep learning in particular and to solve problems in the field.	pdfgreen
two such techniques are synthetic data creation and transfer learning transferring the model learnt from a task in a certain domain and applying it to a related problem in that domain.	pdfgreen
here the critical need for progress in ai safety becomes fully apparent.	pdfgreen
this will involve the development of algorithms with safety considerations at their core.future advances in ai will need advanced computing power currently it takes around  processors operating for minutes to run the equivalent of one second of computations performed by just percent of the human brain  so advances in quantum computing distributed computing and deep learning chips will be essential.	pdfgreen
ai in particular has immense potential to help unlock solutions.	pdfgreen
indeed an accompanying technical annex overview of ai applications for solving environmental challenges provides a summary of research into more than existing ai use cases for the environment.	pdfgreen
figure provides a glimpse of such ai applications by environmental challenge area.	pdfgreen
currently most of these focus on automated and assisted intelligence to unlock value from large unstructured real time datasets.	pdfgreen
future applications will likely involve more systems propelled by autonomous decision making where ai acts independently thus creating new opportunities and risks.	pdfgreen
the following set of potential game changers are defined by five key features. transformational impact i.e.	pdfgreen
it could completely disrupt or alter current approaches. adoption potential i.e.	pdfgreen
the potential population size is significant. centrality of ai to the solution i.e.	pdfgreen
ai is a key cog in the solution. systems impact i.e.	pdfgreen
the game changer could really shift the dial across human systems. realizable enabling environment including political and social dynamics i.e.	pdfgreen
the enabling environment can be identified and supported some such possible game changers are listed individually below.	pdfgreen
but often cross sectoral combinations of these game changes offer the greatest potential to fundamentally transform human systems.	pdfgreen
autonomous electric vehicles for example could work in combination with distributed energy grids so that the charging stations and thus the vehicles are fed by a decentralized and optimized renewable energy grid and ultimately become sources in this grid themselves.emerging ai game changers.	pdfgreen
autonomous and connected electric vehiclesai will be vital in the widespread transition to autonomous connected electric vehicles evs  which will ultimately transform short haul mobility while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and delivering cleaner air.	pdfgreen
machine learning enabled autonomous electric vehicles will improve the efficiency of transport networks as connected vehicles communicate with one another and with transport infrastructure to identify hazards while optimizing navigation and network efficiency.	pdfgreen
ev charging will become more affordable via demand response software programs enabled by big data such as auto grid.	pdfgreen
clean smart connected and increasingly autonomous and shared short haul transport will combine ai with other fourth industrial revolution technologies notably the internet of things drones and advanced materials in battery breakthroughs for example.	pdfgreen
increased demand for transport could offset some efficiency gains but overall a smart transport system enabled by ai can be expected to lower emissions.	pdfgreen
improved efficiency may also encourage car sharing and reduce car ownership further reducing emissions from manufacturing and operating vehicles.	pdfgreen
still the transition to connected autonomous fleets in cities will be gradual and will vary from country to country.	pdfgreen
it may be decades before fully autonomous urban fleets are the norm.	pdfgreen
in addition to developing the technology challenges related to public acceptance legal and insurance liability questions and the provision of charging infrastructure will need to be addressed.	pdfgreen
furthermore the vehicle replacement cycle takes approximately  years.while full level vehicle autonomy with no human intervention at all may still be decades away level avs highly automated but with driver takeover when needed may be tested on roads as early as. at this level cars can drive in cities and provide mobility on demand services.	pdfgreen
more substantial emission reduction benefits also begin to appear..	pdfgreen
distributed energy gridsin the energy grid the application of machine learning including deep learning is increasingly widespread in industry.	pdfgreen
for the environment the use of ai to make distributed energy possible at scale is critical for decarbonizing the power grid expanding the use of and market for renewables and increasing energy efficiency.	pdfgreen
ai can enhance the predictability of demand and supply for renewables improve energy storage and load management assist in the integration and reliability of renewables and enable dynamic pricing and trading creating market incentives.	pdfgreen
ai capable virtual power plants vpps can integrate aggregate and optimize the use of solar panels microgrids energy storage installations and other facilities.	pdfgreen
distributed energy grids may also be extended to incorporate new sources such as solar spray or paint coated infrastructure of vehicles and to allow ai enabled solar roads to expand connect and optimize the grid further.	pdfgreen
as economies and settlements move away from heavy infrastructure towards harnessing artificial intelligence for the earth smart infrastructure with a low environmental footprint the decentralized nature of distributed energy grids mean they have the potential to be used globally.	pdfgreen
. smart agriculture precision agriculture including precision nutrition is expected to increasingly involve automated data collection and decision making at the farm level for example to plant spray and harvest crops optimally to allow early detection of crop diseases and issues to provide timed nutrition to livestock and generally to optimize agricultural inputs and returns.	pdfgreen
this promises to increase the resource efficiency of the agriculture industry lowering the use of water fertilizers and pesticides which are creating runoff that currently finds its way into rivers oceans and insect populations causing damage to important ecosystems.	pdfgreen
here the key fourth industrial revolution technologies that will combine with ai include robot labour such as blue river products and core intelligence chatbots  drones synthetic biology in crop genome analysis for example and advanced materials.	pdfgreen
machine and deep learning will also work in tandem with the internet of things and with drones.	pdfgreen
sensors measuring conditions such as crop moisture temperature and soil composition will give ai the data needed to automatically optimize production and trigger important actions such as adding moisture. drones are increasingly being used to monitor conditions and communicate with the sensors and ai enabled systems. regulation of data ownership pricing algorithms for commodity goods and cross border data flows will need to keep pace with these fast growing technological advances.	pdfgreen
smart agriculture has the potential to fundamentally change agriculture even more than th century mass farming methods did.	pdfgreen
and these changes may spread more rapidly than previous ones..	pdfgreen
weather forecasting and climate modelling a new field of climate informatics is already blossoming harnessing ai to fundamentally transform weather forecasting including prediction of extreme events and to improve understanding of the effects of climate change. this is promising because the weather and climate science community already has large amounts of data and continues to collect more providing a fine test bed for machine and deep learning applications.	pdfgreen
until now use of these frequently updated datasets has demanded substantial high performance computing power and limited the accessibility and usability for the scientific and decision making communities.	pdfgreen
ai can solve these challenges increasing both the performance of weather and climate modelling and making it more accessible and usable for decision making.	pdfgreen
public agencies including the uk met office and nasa and private sector actors such as ibm and microsoft are using ai and machine learning to enhance the performance and efficiency of weather and climate models. these models process complicated physical equations including fluid dynamics for the atmosphere and oceans and heuristics for elements that can t be fully resolved for example aspects of atmospheric chemistry such as ice particles turning to water.	pdfgreen
the complexity of the governing equations requires expensive energy intensive computing but deep learning networks can emulate some aspects of these climate simulations allowing computers to run much faster and incorporate more complexity of the real world system into the calculations.	pdfgreen
ai techniques may also help correct biases in models extracting the most relevant data to avoid data degradation and otherwise improve computational efficiency.	pdfgreen
in all of these cases ai with human oversight supervises to improve simulations.	pdfgreen
over time cheaper faster weather and climate models unlocked through ai could reduce the need for energy hungry supercomputers lower the cost of research and open the field of weather and climate science to many more researchers.wider ai applications include simpler machine learning techniques combining weather models and ancillary impacts data to help predict the effects of small scale extreme weather events such as windstorms and floods on human systems allowing better risk management.	pdfgreen
more broadly however the application of nascent deep reinforcement learning techniques is unchartered territory for climate and weather science.	pdfgreen
investigation will be needed to identify the real world physical systems in which these new tools will be most useful.	pdfgreen
we are already seeing how better weather and climate data helps decision makers from the public and private sectors to improve climate resilience.	pdfgreen
the uk met office for example has developed a chatbot application to demonstrate how frictionless data or queries can be extracted from complex big datasets using sophisticated ai in real time and communicating to the user through a simple interface.	pdfgreen
another example involves artificial assistants fed by forecasts data that can help make everyday decisions from what to wear to when to travel.	pdfgreen
some companies are already working together and with universities and government agencies within the field of climate informatics.	pdfgreen
there is now an opportunity to formalize organize and promote the emerging scientific discipline of ai for weather and climate science including international coordination for example through the world meteorological organization and the intergovernmental panel on climate change  dedicated national r d funding and cross industry collaboration.	pdfgreen
harnessing artificial intelligence for the earth.	pdfgreen
a community disaster response data and analytics platformthe speed and effectiveness with which organizations and people can respond to disasters has a substantial impact on the extent of economic losses and human suffering particularly in the most catastrophic events.	pdfgreen
but delays often occur due to a lack of information analytical insight and awareness of the best course of action.	pdfgreen
often the necessary data exists in large part but is segregated among various organizations and is thus mostly inaccessible to communities.better resiliency planning is also an important component to mitigate the damage of future natural catastrophes.	pdfgreen
ai can be used to sort through multidimensional data about a region and identify which aspects have the biggest impact on resilience.	pdfgreen
for example machine learning combined with natural language processing algorithms could identify the best station points and routes for distribution and evacuation the amount of relief required and optimal relief effort timetables.	pdfgreen
here ai would work in combination with other fourth industrial revolution technologies including drones and the internet of things.	pdfgreen
deep reinforcement learning may one day be integrated into disaster simulations to determine optimal response strategies similar to the way ai is currently being used to identify the best move in games like alphago.	pdfgreen
harnessing ai to provide better disaster response and planning will require public private partnerships.	pdfgreen
a community of technical legal and accounting experts for example would need to specify key datasets and standardize approaches define methodologies for leveraging apis and machine learning tools to access vital data securely and accountably and establish the terms and conditions for stakeholders to operate within the system.	pdfgreen
. decentralized watermachine and deep learning could enable a step change in the optimization of water resource management.	pdfgreen
increasingly ai has the potential to create distributed off grid water resources analogous to decentralized energy systems.household smart meters can produce large volumes of data that can be used to predict water flows spot inconsistencies and check leaks.	pdfgreen
the next stage will be to combine machine learning the internet of things and blockchain to create a truly decentralized water system where local resources and closed loop water recycling gain value.	pdfgreen
water resources could even be traded via blockchain.	pdfgreen
furthermore machine learning predictive modelling and robotics can be combined to transform current approaches to building and managing water infrastructure and to accelerate innovation in environmental engineering.	pdfgreen
rivers for example could be engineered to autonomously adjust their own sediment flows.	pdfgreen
coupled with ai informed pricing such approaches could optimize water usage and drive behaviour change by providing incentives for water conservation.	pdfgreen
. ai designed intelligent connected and liveable citiesbeyond autonomous vehicles deep learning also promises better urban planning leading to resilient human centric cities with minimal air pollution and environmental impact.	pdfgreen
ai could also be used to simulate and automate the generation of zoning laws building ordinances and floodplains.	pdfgreen
combined with ar and vr ai generated data could be used by city planners and infrastructure investors along with officials responsible for ensuring disaster preparedness and when needed reconstruction.	pdfgreen
ai smart meters and the internet of things can also help forecast and optimize urban energy generation and demand both city wide and at the level of individual homes and buildings.	pdfgreen
with the addition of ai this could optimize water and energy use across the city potentially reducing the need for costly additional infrastructure while reducing pollution and congestion thereby reducing the city s environmental footprint and increasing its liveability.	pdfgreen
. oceans data platformreal time monitoring with ai can improve decision making in fields ranging from species management and protection to natural resource management to climate resilience.	pdfgreen
one early example is the ocean data alliance which has started to work together to develop and implement open source solutions to provide the data needed for comprehensive monitoring of ocean resources from satellites to data from ocean exploration technologies.	pdfgreen
developed fully this approach could allow decision makers to use machine learning to monitor predict and respond to changing conditions such as illegal fishing a disease outbreak or a coral bleaching event.harnessing artificial intelligence for the earthfurther off ai game changersby the s further advances in ai and other fourth industrial revolution technologies may bring us more innovations for the environment.	pdfgreen
these could include. a real time digital dashboard of the earth a real time open api digital geospatial dashboard for the planet would enable the monitoring modelling and management of environmental systems at a scale and speed never before possible from tackling illegal deforestation water extraction fishing and poaching to air pollution natural disaster response and smart agriculture.	pdfgreen
we have the ai methods to do this but we need more information more frequently received and at greater resolution than at present.	pdfgreen
the challenge is to build something truly transformational easy to use in real time open access and data dense meaning that the information is high resolution scalable and aggregates environmental and human exposure data.	pdfgreen
this will require collaboration among entrepreneurs industry government and the non profit sector.public and private systems that can help amass the necessary data include the european space agency s copernicus nasa s earth observing system and the private companies planet digital globe and orbital insights.	pdfgreen
these organizations can provide comprehensive earth observation from space.	pdfgreen
however this data would need to be aggregated and retrieved in context which requires tools to extract and label the relevant information.	pdfgreen
ai can help tackle this challenge as we build a dashboard with usable data including both environmental and hazard data layers along with exposure layers.	pdfgreen
the implications for natural resource management including investment policy making and dispute settlement could be profound.at least two steps are already being taken in this direction.	pdfgreen
the us national science foundation s earthcube initiative uses machine learning and simulation modelling to create a d living model of the entire planet.	pdfgreen
and the us company planet has put over micro satellites into orbit to image the whole planet s landmass daily at a resolution of  metres. platforms like this one could bring a breakthrough planet plans to incorporate computer vision developments and machine learning to make an index of the planet tracked over time.	pdfgreen
crucially it is developing practical ways to extract data and is collaborating with ngos and governments to develop public good analytics for earth systems management.new processing capabilities could provide close to real time transparency by enabling authorities and even the general public to monitor fishing shipping ocean mining and other activities.	pdfgreen
vessel algorithmic patterns could identify illegal fishing biological sensors could monitor the health of coral reefs and ocean current patterns could improve weather forecasting.	pdfgreen
one of the main challenges to realizing such a platform is the processing power required ocean modelling is second only to astrophysics in its hunger for computing power.	pdfgreen
but as the cost of data storage and processing declines new possibilities to model human activities and how they impact our oceans will become available.	pdfgreen
to prevent the emergence of multiple competing platforms which could reduce effectiveness and increase the overall costs of collecting managing and using ocean data an open access platform could be created that enables data from different sources to continually be uploaded in a standardized format.	pdfgreen
public private partnerships may be needed to ensure trust governance and accuracy..	pdfgreen
earth bank of codesbio inspired innovations such as blood pressure medication derived from viper venom aim to replicate nature s products and processes.	pdfgreen
historically the revenues from such activities have not been shared with the indigenous and traditional communities from which the knowledge comes.	pdfgreen
for the first time in history the fair sharing of benefits and a significant new stream of conservation finance is now possible using a combination of blockchain artificial intelligence advanced sensors and the internet of things.	pdfgreen
the amazon third way initiative is developing the earth bank of codes ebc  a project to create an open global public good digital platform that registers nature s assets recording their spatial and temporal provenance and codifying the associated rights and obligations.	pdfgreen
this helps to implement the nagoya protocol of the convention on biological diversity.	pdfgreen
a fusion of ai and complex systems analytics will be vital to bundling the biological biomimetic and traditional knowledge assets from a biodiversity hotspot to maximize economic and conservation value simultaneously.	pdfgreen
in addition an ai driven biological search engine will allow users to understand more fully the planet s web of life which could optimize scientific discovery catalyse a myriad of bio inspired innovations and improve conservation outcomes by creating new sources of economic value.	pdfgreen
ai techniques will include natural language processing deep learning computer vision probabilistic programming and an array of statistical machine learning techniques.	pdfgreen
this project is building a coalition of willing stakeholders to co design and co implement the ebc in the amazon basin called the amazon bank of codes before replicating and scaling in other biomes on land and in the oceans.harnessing artificial intelligence for the earth.	pdfgreen
autonomous farming and end to end optimized food systemai could enable farms to become almost fully autonomous.	pdfgreen
farmers may be able to grow different crops symbiotically using ai to spot or predict problems and to take appropriate corrective actions via robotics.	pdfgreen
for example should a corn crop be seen to need a booster dose of nitrogen an ai enabled system could deliver the nutrients.	pdfgreen
ai augmented farms could also automatically adjust crop quantities based on supply and demand data.	pdfgreen
this kind of production could be more resilient to earth cycles.our understanding of human dietary needs is likely to improve in the coming decades as we learn how individuals process their food intake based on data from many individual bodies.	pdfgreen
applying machine learning to this data could generate personalized nutrition plans optimized for individuals.	pdfgreen
when combined with autonomous farming autonomous delivery vehicles in house robotic chefs and in house vertical farming entire food supply chains could be optimized and transformed creating minimum waste supply chains while providing high yields.	pdfgreen
the same principles could also be applied to livestock..	pdfgreen
reinforcement learning for natural sciences breakthroughsdeep reinforcement learning could evolve to enable its application to real world problems including solving problems addressed by earth scientists.	pdfgreen
this could enable scientific progress and discovery in scientific areas where the boundary conditions of a system are known but input data is lacking and or the complexity of a system is such that it requires access to currently infeasible computing architecture.technically step one is to understand what the optimal real world natural and human natural systems are in which we can most fully define the boundary conditions to enable the application of reinforcement learning.	pdfgreen
a hybrid approach that combines supervised and unsupervised learning will likely be most successful given the challenges of fully defining the boundary conditions of real world problems.	pdfgreen
understanding which real world systems can be codified and optimizing for reinforcement learning will require collaboration between ai pioneers and domain experts including climate scientists materials scientists biologists and engineers.	pdfgreen
for example deepmind co founder demis hassabis has suggested that in the materials science space a descendant of alphago zero could be used to search for a room temperature superconductor a hypothetical substance that allows electrical current to flow with zero lost energy further allowing for incredibly efficient power systems.	pdfgreen
as was done with go the algorithm would start by combining different inputs in this case the atomic composition of various materials and their associated qualities until it discovers something the humans had missed..	pdfgreen
quantum and distributed computing to dramatically scale computational power for ai for the earthinstead of using brute force to increase the computing power of ai innovators are increasingly exploring other advances such as deep learning chips harnessing the move to cloud and the ability to use distributed computing and quantum computing.	pdfgreen
all of these advances that harnessing artificial intelligence for the earthincrease computing processing power will enable large scale optimization of big data analytics and ai scaling and transforming their application and impact for environmental challenges.	pdfgreen
but advances in quantum computing in parallel could offer fundamentally new opportunities for scientific discovery.	pdfgreen
classical computers cannot compute things the way nature does which operates in quantum mechanics they are limited to the human made binary code of zeros and ones rather than the natural reality of continuous variables.	pdfgreen
in other words with classical computers we are currently modelling the earth system in a way that it does not actually function.	pdfgreen
quantum computers open the door to solving the quantum problems as they exist in nature and discovering ways in which the earth system really works from key applications in quantum chemistry to quantum physics and mechanics.	pdfgreen
this could lead to the discovery of new advanced materials new biological processes e.g.	pdfgreen
energy transference cellular growth or ecosystem dynamics  and progress in the modelling of planetary physics..	pdfgreen
the home supercomputer and ai research assistants for democratized scientific progressearth science is currently one of the most computational heavy fields of scientific discovery with supercomputing systems currently in widespread use across the field and climate researches using some of the largest and most powerful systems available today.	pdfgreen
the cost of building accessing and running supercomputers inhibits access to researchers and limits the pace at which new modelling and research can be undertaken.	pdfgreen
over the coming decade or two computational power and advances in ai algorithms will likely reach a point in which the average home computer will have as much power as today s supercomputers.	pdfgreen
in parallel machine learning more broadly will also unlock faster and cheaper earth system and climate models and ai will begin to replace many of the labour intensive and time consuming tasks that scientists now do e.g. trawling through data archives converting files acting in effect as an ai research assistant.	pdfgreen
the result is that the pool of scientists and practitioners that have access to computing power and ai tools could increase vastly progress in earth science and its application could become democratized and scientific productivity could be substantially boosted with a subsequent acceleration in discoveries.	pdfgreen
by their nature ai algorithms which are self learning and continuously adapting are difficult to explain and in many cases may not be explainable to humans at all.	pdfgreen
an inability to understand the rationale behind ai outputs also makes it difficult to ascertain whether the performance or outputs of ai algorithms are accurate or desirable.	pdfgreen
significant risks are therefore conceivable.	pdfgreen
the emerging field of explainable ai xai research aims to create new ai methods that are accountable to human reasoning.	pdfgreen
but this field is still in its early days.	pdfgreen
meanwhile ongoing research aims to reduce model bias resulting from biases in training data and to increase the stability of model performance.	pdfgreen
as ai solutions are deployed one unintended consequence is the over reliance on ai algorithms with variable performance.	pdfgreen
it is essential that humans stay in the loop on auditing algorithm outputs to mitigate these unintended biases and wider performance risks.example early warning systems for natural disasters such as flooding are trained using historical data on weather patterns.	pdfgreen
however if there is a lack of understanding of factors driving model predictions due to poor explainability there is a significant risk of false alarms or false negatives particularly in situations that are not represented in the data used to train the ai model. security risksmisuse of ai via hacking is a serious risk as many algorithms being developed with good intentions for example for autonomous vehicles could be repurposed for harm for example for autonomous weaponry.	pdfgreen
this raises new risks for global safety.	pdfgreen
good governance is required to build explainability transparency and validity into the algorithms including drawing lines between beneficial and harmful ai.	pdfgreen
machine learning especially deep learning models can also be duped by malicious inputs known as adversarial attacks.	pdfgreen
for example it is possible to find input data combinations that can trigger perverse outputs from machine learning models in effect hacking them.	pdfgreen
harnessing artificial intelligence for the earthsocial riskslarge scale automation threatens to reduce employment in transportation manufacturing agriculture and the service sector among others.	pdfgreen
higher unemployment rates could lead to greater inequality in society.	pdfgreen
in addition algorithms designed by a subset of the population at a national and global level have the potential for unconscious bias possibly leading to results that marginalize minorities or other groups.	pdfgreen
autonomous weapons also pose a significant threat to society possibly permitting bigger faster conflicts.	pdfgreen
once unleashed this might lead to rapid and significant environmental damage even to a doomsday scenario where weaponized ai presents an existential risk to humanity. example autonomous trucks and cars along with energy efficient internet of things manufacturing offer considerable environmental benefits but could also lead to a considerable loss of employment.	pdfgreen
goldman sachs estimates that the us alone will lose an estimated  jobs per year when av saturation peaks. regional economic decline and widening social inequality and unrest could also follow in manufacturing towns or along truck routes.ethical risksthe ethical and responsible use of ai involves three main elements the use of big data the growing reliance on algorithms to perform tasks shape choices and make decisions and the gradual reduction of human involvement in many processes.	pdfgreen
together these raise issues related to fairness responsibility equality and respect for human rights. additionally while biased ai outcomes can raise significant privacy concerns many insights and decisions about individuals are based on inferred group or community attributes.	pdfgreen
accordingly consideration of the harm ai could do must be framed beyond the individual level and recognize that privacy is not the only issue.example autonomous emergency food and disaster relief delivery systems that are trained using reinforcement learning or historical demand patterns will route supplies to specific regions during natural disasters.	pdfgreen
this could create ethical dilemmas relating to accountability for delivery dysfunctions priority setting and results.example hackers could access automated warning systems distributed energy grids or connected autonomous transport platforms and cause regional disruptions.	pdfgreen
appropriate governance will be required to ensure human and earth friendly ai and prevent misuse.	pdfgreen
misuse of ai could also occur when systems fall into the wrong hands.	pdfgreen
for example poachers could profit from ai enabled endangered animal tracking tools meant for conservation efforts.control risksai systems work autonomously and interact with one another creating machine centred feedback mechanisms that can cause unexpected outcomes.	pdfgreen
for example chatbots interacting with one another have created their own language that humans cannot understand.	pdfgreen
in a financial crash was caused by the interactions of multiple ai bots speed trading which created artificial market inflation.	pdfgreen
proactive control monitoring and safeguards are necessary to catch these issues before they become a problem.	pdfgreen
example smart energy optimization across buildings and infrastructure will create interactions between energy use decisions within each building and at the regional level.	pdfgreen
each building would operate individually assessing overall demand patterns to determine low cost energy use approaches.	pdfgreen
depending on circumstances individual building decisions will interact with regional ones potentially altering demand in ways that could crash regional energy systems.economic risksas companies adopt ai it may alter the competitive landscape creating winners and losers.	pdfgreen
those able to improve their decision making most quickly through ai may find the benefits accelerate very quickly while slower adopters may be left behind.	pdfgreen
companies that struggle in the ai transition may be forced to reduce investment possibly impairing their sustainability performance.	pdfgreen
tax base erosion presents another economic threat as the current system based on bricks and mortar and nation states struggles to keep pace with the globalized digital economy.	pdfgreen
tax erosion could be a drag on public spending including investment in for example programmes designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.	pdfgreen
current tax systems may need re evaluation as automation changes workplaces potentially reducing the number of jobs available.	pdfgreen
example increased productivity from automation plus rising consumption from improved personalization product design and ai informed marketing could increase resource use waste and demand for energy.harnessing artificial intelligence for the earthconclusions and recommendations conclusions ai systems and their ability to control machines automatically and remotely have caught the public s imagination.	pdfgreen
the opportunity for ai to be harnessed to benefit humankind and its environment is substantial.	pdfgreen
the intelligence and productivity gains that ai will deliver can unlock new solutions to society s most pressing environmental challenges climate change biodiversity ocean health water management air pollution and resilience among others.however ai technology also has the potential to amplify and exacerbate many of the risks we face today.	pdfgreen
to be sure that ai is developed and governed wisely government and industry leaders must ensure the safety explainability transparency and validity of ai applications.	pdfgreen
it is incumbent on authorities ai researchers technology pioneers and ai adopters in industry alike to encourage deployments that earn trust and avoid abuse of the social contract.	pdfgreen
achieving this requires a collaborative effort to ensure that as ai progresses its idea of a good future is aligned to human values and encapsulates a future that is safe for humanity in all respects its people and their planet.	pdfgreen
collaborating for interdisciplinary solutions there will be a need for significantly more interaction among technologists policy makers domain specialists and even philosophers to optimize the design and deployment of ai applications for the earth both at a broad systems level and in relation to individual applications.	pdfgreen
in conjunction academic and research institutions will need to develop interdisciplinary educational and research programmes to reflect this multifaceted and multidisciplinary approach.	pdfgreen
directing finance for innovation realizing the goal of earth friendly ai will require significant funding to support scaling and commercialization of new solutions.	pdfgreen
public private dialogue and partnerships will be crucial to develop solutions assure good governance and overcome financial barriers.	pdfgreen
this section lists some recommendations categorized by stakeholder groups to speed up innovation minimize environmental risks and maximize environmental benefits from the application of ai.	pdfgreen
three overarching areas however are particularly pertinent to all stakeholders delivering responsible ai to ensure that sustainability principles are embedded alongside wider considerations of ai safety ethics value and governance.	pdfgreen
this applies to decisions by private and public sector actors about investment in design of and operation of ai systems.	pdfgreen
it also incorporates efforts to advance and implement ai accountability along with the development of governance frameworks particularly in relation to data and algorithms.	pdfgreen
definitions and standards relating to the misuse of ai will also be needed that incorporate misuse for environmental as well as human harm.	pdfgreen
the partnership on ai is a positive step in this direction. companies from all sectors firms should establish board level ai advisory units to ensure that companies boards understand ai including safety ethics values and governance considerations.	pdfgreen
companies should also ensure that their technology strategies build in and optimize the effect ai will have on sustainability outcomes both to capture new business opportunities and to manage risks.	pdfgreen
technology pioneer companies both start ups and established technology firms developing ai need to embed environmental considerations into design principles.	pdfgreen
technology pioneers also have an opportunity to innovate in realizing the potential of ai for the environment.	pdfgreen
however robust and well governed data security use consent and processing are critical to building societal trust and confidence.	pdfgreen
data and in some circumstances algorithms will in many cases have to be auditable particularly in collaborations with public sector institutions.	pdfgreen
industry cooperation will also be important to advance ai accountability.	pdfgreen
industry collaboration on ai standard setting to develop industry wide and industry regulator teamwork to aid in ai standard setting for example through consensus protocols and smart contracts that include efficiency principles or which require common agreement and governance.	pdfgreen
interdisciplinary solutions many emerging ai solutions could have enormous impacts on the ways we live and work but industry led solutions may be designed and developed by a small group of people with a limited perspective.	pdfgreen
increasingly there will need to be diversity in ai development and use including significantly more interaction among technology practitioners domain and sectoral experts and philosophers lawyers psychologists and others in order to develop deploy and champion holistic ai mechanisms and solutions.	pdfgreen
for governmentsgiven the potential for disruptive social and environmental consequences it will be essential to develop sophisticated national and international governance structures for the new ai enabled digital economy.	pdfgreen
these governance mechanisms collaborating with industry and civil society can help ensure that ai advances support inclusive growth that is aligned with the un s sustainable development goals.	pdfgreen
within these frameworks the following policy considerations should be advanced r d investment coordinated and targeted large scale funding commitments could encourage research and funding collaboration on ai for good  connecting industrial academic and government research agencies.	pdfgreen
research priorities will need to encourage interdisciplinary research bridging technology social and environmental disciplines will be essential.	pdfgreen
this could include funding new specialist programmes and international research collaborations for example on the application of ai to weather prediction and climate modelling under the governance of the world meteorological organization and national meteorological and climate agencies.	pdfgreen
responsible technology policy the development of responsible technology policies could set clear parameters for technology innovators and ensure alignment with human values and international frameworks such as the sustainable development goals.	pdfgreen
stakeholders could develop a definition and standard regarding the misuse of ai while ensuring that social and environmental considerations are incorporated into national digital strategies.	pdfgreen
better data trusted data creation of better data environments including for data access and data skills could maximize the use of machine learning for sustainable solutions.	pdfgreen
efforts could focus on improving the systems and protocols by which data is defined gathered accessed and manipulated.	pdfgreen
this includes government initiatives for open public data industry government collaboration on data and code verification or audits and policy frameworks or agreements to make strategic data available to specific users with specified safeguards in order to enable ai applications for societal and environmental benefits.	pdfgreen
algorithm assurance and transparency governments have a role in regulating the use of black box ai models for high risk high impact environmental domains such as autonomous vehicles.	pdfgreen
regulations could be accompanied by a process for evaluating the robustness of algorithms algorithmic assurance on an ongoing basis.	pdfgreen
algorithmic bias policy frameworks will need to support technology companies other industries and researchers to manage potential systemic bias in algorithms and ensure a social safety net for ai.	pdfgreen
crowd sourced raw data that technology companies use in their algorithms typically reflect the biases and prejudices inherent in society at large.	pdfgreen
policy frameworks are needed to balance concerns about unfairness and discrimination in publicly sourced big data with the technical and ethical challenges of monitoring and the potential censorship of data.	pdfgreen
innovative finance mechanisms and partnerships there is a need to align both incentives and risks for private sector innovation and scaling of ai applications for the environment including support for early stage commercialization.	pdfgreen
for research institutions bias xai research further research is needed to identify algorithmic bias and to find ways to improve the explainability of ai specifically for environmental applications that support government and company efforts to harness ai for the earth.	pdfgreen
as each domain has nuances of how data or algorithmic bias influence the system there needs to be further evaluation of the risks associated with environmental impact.	pdfgreen
interdisciplinary programmes research institutions should help lead the interdisciplinary approach by further developing and disseminating educational programmes that bring together environmental and technology data scientists and practitioners while highlighting the use impact and risks of ai for the environment.	pdfgreen
educational partnerships to ensure vocational school and university graduates are ready to enter the job market with practical tools that integrate digital and sustainability.	pdfgreen
