31	domestic	31	1	Manually_gathered	another distinct category of arguments relies on justifications where traditions are valued and are constantly being revisited in making judgments about the present, and where locality and ties to a place are revered. 
32	domestic	32	1	Manually_gathered	evaluations of this type support hierarchies of reputation and trustworthiness. 
33	domestic	33	1	Manually_gathered	these justifications relate to what boltanski and thevenot (1991) term the domestic order of worth in which the claim of a general value is warranted by personal tie or local attachment, so that personal character or proximity are considered the source or building blocks of universal goods. 
34	domestic	34	1	Manually_gathered	in the french case, arguments of this sort are found in the call by project opponents to protect the region’s treasured culture and heritage (patrimoine in french), of which the valley’s landscape is a significant part.

36	domestic	36	1	Manually_gathered	but these arguments are oriented less around the idea of heritage and patrimony in the united states and more in terms of the protection of one’s backyard. 
37	domestic	37	1	Manually_gathered	justifications based on tradition and locality are utilized extensively by opponents of the somport project in france, and there are a variety of rich testimonials from the inhabitants of the aspe valley on the need to preserve a patrimony and way of life cherished by many and upheld in various ways by existing traditions of the region.

44	domestic	44	1	Manually_gathered	in bossuet\'s political construction, the king, who is the greatest being, is comparable with a father, who sacrifices himself for his subjects. 
45	domestic	45	1	Manually_gathered	in this model one must, to evaluate someone\'s worth, know his place in the network of dependencies from which this person draws his own authority. 
46	domestic	46	1	Manually_gathered	in order to describe the objects of the domestic world of the present, we used a practical guide teaching good manners and human relations within the company, intended for socially mobile workers who had been promoted to more responsible positions (entitled savoir vivre et promotion).

63	domestic	63	1	Manually_gathered	the domestic world does not unfold inside the circle of family relationships alone, especially given the restricted notion of family, detached from any reference to the political order, that is accepted in our society today. 
64	domestic	64	1	Manually_gathered	when this world unfolds, the search for what is just stresses personal relationships. 
65	domestic	65	1	Manually_gathered	the worth that, in the domestic world is a function of the position one occupies m chains of personal dependence can only be grasped in a relational sense: worthier than ... , less worthy than... for the same reasons, the exercise of worth is subject here to constraints of place and time linked to the need to present oneself in person in the presence of others, in order to manifest one\'s own importance. 
66	domestic	66	1	Manually_gathered	this need underlies the interest taken in everything having to do with the body, its clothing and its presentation. 
67	domestic	67	1	Manually_gathered	arrangements of a domestic nature are weakly equipped with instruments for acting from a distance; such instruments are particularly well developed, in contrast, in the civic world, which lays emphasis on the objectivity of rules detached from persons and on mechanisms of representation. 
68	domestic	68	1	Manually_gathered	in the domestic world, objects are not apprehended according to their own worth, as is the case in the industrial world, but essentially according to how much they contribute to establishing hierarchical relations among people (we find examples in objects used in the context of social encounters) and also, according to the degree to which they facilitate the inscription. 
69	domestic	69	1	Manually_gathered	of the worth and thus the identification of personal counters. 
70	domestic	70	1	Manually_gathered	in the domestic world, where beings are immediately qualified according to their worth, in such a way that their manifestation necessarily entails a determination of their position in a hierarchy, the inscription of signs of worth in the form of titles, heraldry, clothing, marks on the body, and so on, is sought in order to limit the uncertainty of situations involving personal encounters and to reduce the costs of identification. 
71	domestic	71	1	Manually_gathered	but the importance that the processes of inscription take on tends to attach worth to persons. 
72	domestic	72	1	Manually_gathered	the case of irrevocable titles and especially hereditary titles is exemplary: such titles render critiques powerless, because in most instances they cannot reach their intended goal, namely, the institution of a new test. 
73	domestic	73	1	Manually_gathered	"tests thus often take the form of confirmations; this is apparent in the archaic expressions of the domestic world offered by fairy tales, which are saturated with anecdotes in which a worthy person, disguised as someone of lesser worth, is subjected to a test that reveals his own inherent worthiness (for example, the princess and the pea""). """
74	domestic	74	1	Manually_gathered	it is through reference to generation, tradition, and hierarchy that order can be established among beings of a domestic nature. 
75	domestic	75	1	Manually_gathered	these three terms themselves are in a relation of equivalence, because the bond of personal dependence that connects a less worthy person with a superior-always constructed in the image of the father, whose state of worth is highest because he is the incarnation of the tradition-can be conceived in more than one way: since the worthiest person is found at the point of origin, the bond can be read as a link either in the chain of generations or in a hierarchical chain. 
76	domestic	76	1	Manually_gathered	in domestic worth, beings in a state of worthiness achieve superiority in each of the three components: as part of a hierarchy, they are worthy owing to the relation that connects them to worthier beings by whom they are appreciated and valued, beings who have attached them to their persons. 
77	domestic	77	1	Manually_gathered	it is in this way that they are distinguished; the quality of distinction does not presuppose here, as it does in the world of fame, a competition of all against all in a marketplace of esteem, but rather the exclusive judgment of a superior or leader and the elective choice that makes someone stand out from the ranks. 
78	domestic	78	1	Manually_gathered	beings are also worthy because they are rooted in tradition, that is, they are proper (as opposed, for example, to legal in the civic world or to exact in industrial arrangements). 
79	domestic	79	1	Manually_gathered	they exist in continuity (a property of the unworthy in the inspired world), and they possess all the qualities that manifest permanence, such as firmness, loyalty, punctuality. 
80	domestic	80	1	Manually_gathered	these virtues are manifested in behavior that varies depending, on the one hand, on whether the relationship with intimates or with outsiders is emphasized and, on the other hand, whether the relationship with superiors or with inferiors is emphasized. 
81	domestic	81	1	Manually_gathered	"attentive to intimates (for example, a spouse), to whom one owes thoughtfulness, attention, and propriety, the worthy person is cordial with visitors: the reputation of households is often made by visitors; thus one always benefits from being very cordial toward them, whether they are important or not"".

87	domestic	87	1	Manually_gathered	"in the domestic world, where worth presupposes personal loyalty to a worthy being and membership in the closed universe of a household, objects are all the more private in character (letters, for example) to the extent that they are associated with the more worthy beings, and discretion consists in refusing to listen to gossip and especially in refusing to pass it along"".

103	domestic	103	1	Manually_gathered	in a domestic world, beings are immediately qualified by their relationships with others. 
104	domestic	104	1	Manually_gathered	when beings belong to the same household, the relationship is one of order. 
105	domestic	105	1	Manually_gathered	    the terms thus refer to the beings that encompass them or to those that they themselves encompass, that is, those (superiors) from whom they delve their origin or those (inferiors) to whom they themselves have given rise. 
106	domestic	106	1	Manually_gathered	when the principle of subordination is engenderment and when the relation to others is established by means of reproduction, the more worthy beings precede and the less worthy follow in the generational chain: thus forebears and ancestors- grandfather and grandmother, father-in-law and mother-in-law, uncles and aunts, parents- are more worthy; children, or girls, are less worthy. 
107	domestic	107	1	Manually_gathered	but the principle of engenderment is not irrupted to procreation, and within a given household the more worthy beings are the primary causes of the less worthy ones, apart from blood ties: thus the husband (more _worthy) makes a woman his wife (less worthy) by marriage; the master or the mistress of the household contains, and is, the beings included therein: unmarried persons, children, servants, household pets. 
108	domestic	108	1	Manually_gathered	in a domestic world, in which beings can be qualified according to an extensive range of different states of worthiness, the less worthy are always present and designated as such because they are the very substance with which the worth of the more worthy that include them is constructed. 
109	domestic	109	1	Manually_gathered	thus persons who possess dignity in subordination, however unworthy they may be, are only truly deficient when they find themselves detached from the units that included them, either by distancing (foreigner, outsider) or owing to their own selfishness. 
110	domestic	110	1	Manually_gathered	the father is principle of cohesion in the family, the one who establishes the link to an origin; like the boss, or, earlier, the king, the father is the one who lifts beings up by means of the dependence in which he holds them and who thus gives them access to all the worth they are capable of achieving according to the level they occupy. 
111	domestic	111	1	Manually_gathered	since beings are always defined by a relation of subordination. 
112	domestic	112	1	Manually_gathered	similarly, less worthy beings are equivalent and no particular feature of childhood distinguishes small children from the other subordinate beings (unmarried persons, servants, and so on) for whom the more worthy beings are responsible. 
113	domestic	113	1	Manually_gathered	finally, when beings are not directly qualified by belonging to a hierarchical unit (household, guild, and so on), the relation that defines them does not specify their worth, which depends on that of a person with whom they have a relationship: a friend, a confidant, an intimate, a guest, an acquaintance, and so on, may be more or less worthy according to the worth of the other term, and association with a worthy person, which raises one\'s status, is opposed to undesirable associations, which lower it.

607	civic	607	1	Manually_gathered	various forms of these civic justifications are found in both cases, and equality or solidarity is often the guiding logic underlying the modes of engagement or organization. 
608	civic	608	1	Manually_gathered	there are comparative differences also, relating generally to the fact that in the united states the emphasis is more on equal rights, while in france the emphasis is on solidarity against inequality (but not as much on civil rights). 
609	civic	609	1	Manually_gathered	this attempt to generalize the cause is couched in civic language of solidarity between struggles during meetings where spokespersons provide testimonies of comparable experiences. 
610	civic	610	1	Manually_gathered	the opposition to the somport project also organized many demonstrations and used the high level of participation in their demonstrations and their unitary slogans as proof for their arguments against the project. 
611	civic	611	1	Manually_gathered	the local grassroots opposition coalition in tuolumne county often emphasizes their representation of a diverse array of local people (not just the rafting interests or the environmentalists), and the silent solidarity of many more uninvolved but concerned local citizens.

613	civic	613	1	Manually_gathered	both sides at different times collected thousands of names on petitions and submitted them to either the local board of supervisors or the national ferc officials. 
614	civic	614	1	Manually_gathered	whereas in france, the civic reference to the general interest or solidarity is not indexed on the number of supporters or some measure of public opinion (see the next chapter for further exploration of this also). 
615	civic	615	1	Manually_gathered	the debate over the clavey in the turlock area, the valley agricultural region where the power from the dam would be used, provides additional insight into how solidarity is conceived in terms of opinion in the united states. for example, the opposition groups compiled lists of groups opposed to tid and tried to make the list as diverse and as public as possible. 
616	civic	616	1	Manually_gathered	this name shows the connection often made in the united states between civic equality concerns and market concerns, which were seen as more effective and generally resonant than strictly environmental arguments (or environmental-sounding group names). 
617	civic	617	1	Manually_gathered	in contrast, it is more common in france for equality and solidarity justifications to be connected with justifications concerning infrastructure planning and technical efficiency. 
618	civic	618	1	Manually_gathered	projects like the somport tunnel are often defended by their developers as meeting the needs of citizens (collectively and equally) through the most competent technical planning. 
619	civic	619	1	Manually_gathered	in fact, the civil servants of the ministry of public works, charged with planning and building infrastructure projects, denounced local opponents of the somport project as trying to protect their own piece of land and remaining stuck in the past, while resisting progress and denying the benefits of the project to all others.

621	civic	621	1	Manually_gathered	in the civic polity, as in the domestic polity according to bossuet, civil peace depends on the authority of a sovereign whose position, above the selfish lusts of individuals, secures the common good. 
622	civic	622	1	Manually_gathered	but rousseau's sovereign is disembodied.

1145	project	1145	1	Manually_gathered	this city is founded on the mediating activity employed in the creation of networks, making it valuable in its own right, independently of the goals pursued or the substantive properties of the entities between which the mediation is conducted. 
1146	project	1146	1	Manually_gathered	from this standpoint, mediation is a value in itself, or rather, in the conceptual framework employed here, a specific status of which each actor is liable to take advantage when \'putting people in contact\', \'making connections\', thereby helping to \'construct networks\'. 
1147	project	1147	1	Manually_gathered	entertaining the hypothesis that we are witnessing the formation of a new city, where the tests that matter involve constructing or loosening connections in a network world, obviously does not mean that the establishment of networks represents a radical new departure. 
1148	project	1148	1	Manually_gathered	but it is as if we had to wait until the last third of the twentieth century for the activity of mediating, the art of making and using the most diverse and remote kinds of connection, to be autonomized - separated from the other forms of activity it had hitherto been bound up with - and identified and valued for itself.

1153	project	1153	1	Manually_gathered	in a projective city, the general equivalent - what the status of persons and things is measured by - is activity. 
1154	project	1154	1	Manually_gathered	but in contrast to what we observe in the industrial city, where activity merges with work and the active are quintessentially those who have stable, productive waged work, activity in the projective city surmounts the oppositions between work and non-work, the stable and the unstable, wage-earning class and non-wage-earning class, paid work and voluntary work, that which may be assessed in terms of productivity and that which, not being measurable, eludes calculable assessment. 
1155	project	1155	1	Manually_gathered	\'[simultaneous] development of all the categories in the portfolio\' is therefore indicated: \'thanks to the multiplicity of clients, work for fees offers a certain guarantee of activity. 
1156	project	1156	1	Manually_gathered	self-educational work helps improve the chances of remaining active and voluntary work makes it possible to construct social networks outside work, to participate actively in progress towards a better world and to transmit wisdom to others\' (aubrey, 1994). 
1157	project	1157	1	Manually_gathered	activity aims to generate projects, or to achieve integration into projects initiated by others. 
1158	project	1158	1	Manually_gathered	but the project does not exist outside of the encounter (not being integrated once and for all into an institution or environment, it presents itself as an action to be performed, not as something that is already there). 
1159	project	1159	1	Manually_gathered	hence the activity par excellence is integrating oneself into networks and exploring them, so as to put an end to isolation, and have opportunities for meeting people or associating with things proximity to which is liable to generate a project. 
1160	project	1160	1	Manually_gathered	activity expresses itself in the multiplicity of projects of all kinds that may be pursued concurrently and which, no what matter what happens, must be elaborated successively, since the project represents a transient mechanism in this logic. 
1161	project	1161	1	Manually_gathered	life is conceived as a succession of projects; and the more they differ from one another, the more valuable they are.

1163	project	1163	1	Manually_gathered	and above all their classification according to the distinction between that which pertains to leisure and that which relates to work, is not what matters in this city\'s logic, except in a very subsidiary fashion. 
1164	project	1164	1	Manually_gathered	what matters is to develop activity that is to say, never to be short of a project, bereft of an idea, always to have something in mind, in the pipeline, with other people whom one meets out of a desire to do something. 
1165	project	1165	1	Manually_gathered	when they engage in a project, everyone concerned knows that the undertaking to which they are about to contribute is destined to last not a limited period of time - that it not only can, but must, come to an end. 
1166	project	1166	1	Manually_gathered	the prospect of an inevitable, desirable endpoint thus accompanies engagement without affecting enthusiasm. 
1167	project	1167	1	Manually_gathered	this is why engagement is conceived as voluntary. 
1168	project	1168	1	Manually_gathered	having the option not to engage in a given project, and hence choice over one\'s projects, is a condition for the city\'s harmonious functioning; and this condition is guaranteed by the multiple activities everyone develops. 
1169	project	1169	1	Manually_gathered	furthermore, awareness that the project will come to an end is accompanied by the hope that a new project will follow, that it is already in gestation in the fabric of current connections, even if it is not yet known what form it will take. 
1170	project	1170	1	Manually_gathered	accordingly, tension between the requisite commitment and the indicated outcome appears surmountable. 
1171	project	1171	1	Manually_gathered	anything can attain the status of a project, including ventures hostile to capitalism. 
1172	project	1172	1	Manually_gathered	describing every accomplishment with a nominal grammar that is the grammar of the project erases the differences between a capitalist project and a humdrum creation (a sunday club). 
1173	project	1173	1	Manually_gathered	utterly different things can be assimilated to the term \'project\': opening a new factory, closing one, carrying out art-engineering project, putting on a play. each of them is a project, and they all involve the same heroism. 
1174	project	1174	1	Manually_gathered	this is one of the ways in which the projective city can win over forces hostile to capitalism: by proposing a grammar that transcends it, which they in turn will use to describe their own activity while remaining oblivious of the fact that capitalism, too, can slip into it. 
1175	project	1175	1	Manually_gathered	it is precisely because the project is a transient form that it is adjusted to a network world: by multiplying connections and proliferating links, the succession of projects has the effect of extending networks. 
1176	project	1176	1	Manually_gathered	the extension of the network is life itself, whereas any halt to its extension is comparable to death: \'the network spontaneously tends to develop, but it is constantly threatened by the risks of internal ossification or degeneration that can result in death, which might consist in its transformation into a pyramidal organization\' (landier, 1991). 
1177	project	1177	1	Manually_gathered	those without a project who no longer explore networks are threatened with exclusion - that is to say, in effect, with death in a reticular universe. 
1178	project	1178	1	Manually_gathered	they risk not finding a way to attach themselves to projects, and ceasing to exist. 
1179	project	1179	1	Manually_gathered	the development if oneself and one\'s employability (\'being the agent of one\'s own evolution, taking control of one\'s future\' [le saget, 1994]), which is the long-term personal project underlying all the others, will not be successfully accomplished. 
1180	project	1180	1	Manually_gathered	 connection <natural relations between beings> connecting, communicating, co-ordinating, adjusting to others, trusting in a connexionist world, a natural preoccupation of human beings is the desire to connect with others, to make contact, to make connections, so as not to remain isolated.

1182	project	1182	1	Manually_gathered	this is the price of co-ordinating themselves in mechanisms and projects. 
1183	project	1183	1	Manually_gathered	engaging, mobile <condition of great man> enthusiastic, involved, flexible, adaptable, versatile, having potential, employable, autonomous, not prescriptive, knows how to engage others, in touch, tolerant, employability (providing) knowing how to engage in a project, to get fully involved in, it, is the mark of the <condition of great man>. 
1184	project	1184	1	Manually_gathered	to engage, one must be capable of enthusiasm. 
1185	project	1185	1	Manually_gathered	furthermore, given that the project is a complex, uncertain process, which cannot be confined within the limits of invariably incomplete contracts, one must know how to trust those with whom connections are formed     connections that are destined to develop as the project develops. 
1186	project	1186	1	Manually_gathered	but since projects are by their very nature temporary, the ability to disengage from a project in order to be available for new connections counts as much as the capacity for engagement, even at the peak of engagement, enthusiasm, involvement in a project, people at ease in a network world remain \'adaptable, physically and intellectually mobile! 
1187	project	1187	1	Manually_gathered	prepared for change and capable of new investments, in order to increase their \'ability to respond to a changing world\' (crozier and serieyx, 1994). 
1188	project	1188	1	Manually_gathered	far from being attached to an occupation or clinging to a qualification, the great man proves adaptable and flexible, able to switch from one situation to a very different one, and adjust to it; and versatile, capable of changing activity or tools, depending on the nature of the relationship entered into with others or with objects, it is precisely this adaptability and versatility that make him employable - that is to say, in the world of firms, in a position to attach himself to new projects. 
1189	project	1189	1	Manually_gathered	flexibility and adaptability here are qualities that do not derive from obedience.

1229	project	1229	1	Manually_gathered	but these qualities do not suffice to define the condition of great man, because they can be employed in opportunistic fashion, as part of a purely individual strategy for success. 
1230	project	1230	1	Manually_gathered	in the logic of the city, the great are not only those who excel at exploiting the specific resources connected with a world, but also those who place the capacities disclosed in tests at the service of the common good. 
1231	project	1231	1	Manually_gathered	that is to say: in the projective city they are not only those who know how to engage, but also those who are able to engage others, to offer involvement, to make it desirable to follow them, because they inspire trust, they are charismatic, their vision generates enthusiasm.

1233	project	1233	1	Manually_gathered	they are not (hierarchical) bosses, but integrators, facilitators, an inspiration, unifiers of energies, enhancers of life, meaning and autonomy. 
1234	project	1234	1	Manually_gathered	the team trusts them inasmuch as they prove to be connectors, vectors, who do not keep the information or contacts gleaned in networks to themselves, but redistribute them among the team members. 
1235	project	1235	1	Manually_gathered	\'tomorrow\'s manager must ensure that information is shared, that it irrigates the firm thoroughly\' (le saget, 1994).

1238	project	1238	1	Manually_gathered	in this way, \'employability [can be guaranteed]- that is to say, a level of skills and flexibility allowing each individual to find a new job inside or outside the firm\' (aubrey, 1993); employability is thus \'a gift in return from the firm to individuals who are aware of their responsibilities in it\' (aubrey, 1994).

1240	project	1240	1	Manually_gathered	if everyone possesses the capacity to relate, and thus to constitute a link in a network, some people realize this potential in their person in exemplary fashion. 
1241	project	1241	1	Manually_gathered	in very general terms, this is true of all those who, playing an active role in the expansion and animation of networks, act as mediators, whether characterized as strategic brokers able to \'make strategic exchanges outside of hierarchy and boundaries\' (aubrey, 1994), as partners of the third kind (archier et al, 1989), or as tangential contributors. 
1242	project	1242	1	Manually_gathered	they possess the art of reconciling opposites, and know how to bring very different people together, and put them in contact. 
1243	project	1243	1	Manually_gathered	such are, in the first instance, project heads, \'managers\' (in contrast to the old cadres), but also coaches, who stimulate, support the development of managers and practise \'the art of delivering minds\' (aubrey, 1990). 
1244	project	1244	1	Manually_gathered	but such equally are customers, suppliers and subcontractors when they enter into relations of partnership. 
1245	project	1245	1	Manually_gathered	these innovators have scientists, and especially artists, as their models. 
1246	project	1246	1	Manually_gathered	\'the informal network is the preferred organizational mode of writers, scientific researchers and musicians, who develop in domains where knowledge is highly specialized, creative and personalized\' (aubrey, 1990). 
1247	project	1247	1	Manually_gathered	the intuitive manager, like the artist, \'is accompanied by disorder\' (le saget, 1992), is \'in a permanent state of alert and doubt\' (vincent, 1990) and \'at ease in     situations\' (archier et al, 1989). 
1248	project	1248	1	Manually_gathered	but the intuitive manager, the source of inspiration and the coach are not the only models of excellence. 
1249	project	1249	1	Manually_gathered	experts also enjoy high status in the projective city because their competence, which is indispensable, is composed not of standardized knowledge but of personal, integrated knowledge. 
1250	project	1250	1	Manually_gathered	it is the fruit of past experience - that is to say, of multiple connections, particularly with others possessing specific knowledge, formed during earlier projects, of which they preserve the memory. 
1251	project	1251	1	Manually_gathered	dispensing with experts would require being in a position to repeat their careers. 
1252	project	1252	1	Manually_gathered	experts are consulted. 
1253	project	1253	1	Manually_gathered	but their image is less heroic than that of the project head, because they are deemed less adaptable. 
1254	project	1254	1	Manually_gathered	the project head is precisely the one who proves capable of making connections between very different zones of expertise. 
1255	project	1255	1	Manually_gathered	what all these exceptional beings have in common is that they are in a position to explore the links with the richest opportunities, those that will extend the network furthest, which are defined largely by the distance they surmount. 
1256	project	1256	1	Manually_gathered	not all links are of equivalent worth. 
1257	project	1257	1	Manually_gathered	the status of a connection depends upon the extent to which it has established a mediation that makes it possible to abolish distance. 
1258	project	1258	1	Manually_gathered	in so doing, creators of links temporarily find themselves in the position of keyholder, since all those who in turn want to cross the boundaries they have traversed will, for a certain period of time, have to go through them. 
1259	project	1259	1	Manually_gathered	the most interesting links often consist, in fact, in crossing zones where there were few, if any, mediations (structural holes, in the terminology of ronald burt). 
1260	project	1260	1	Manually_gathered	it can be referred to in temporal terms, when old, dormant connections are reactivated. 
1261	project	1261	1	Manually_gathered	it can be alluded to in partial terms, whenever there is co-ordination in real time with others who are spatially distant (\'[t]he starting point will be to ignore geographical distances\' [fapscott and caston, 1994]) - particularly by taking full advantage of modern means of communication (the internet) - as we see in the example of the \'global laboratory\', which is not geographically located and allows researchers in the same discipline, but scattered throughout the \'world, to collaborate in solving the same problem. 
1262	project	1262	1	Manually_gathered	1g and above all, it can be evoked in institutional or social terms, when the beings between whom some transfer is established, and who are proximate in space and time, were hitherto separated by boundaries isolating institutions, disciplines, domains, or (in pierre bourdieu\'s terminology) fields from one another. 
1263	project	1263	1	Manually_gathered	the forms in which a distance is overcome define different ways of possessing high status. 
1264	project	1264	1	Manually_gathered	thus, whereas the expert is above all rich in links of the first (temporal) or second (spatial) types, the project head or source of inspiration excels in establishing connections between domains or fields: he establishes collaboration between people from different disciplines or professions, belonging to various departments, institutions or firms, and brings together, for example, two experts each of whom has experience, but in different domains. 
1265	project	1265	1	Manually_gathered	in a network world, where the more unpredictable and remote connections are, the more likely they are to prove profitable, the class habitus, on which the spontaneous convergence of tastes relies in predominantly domestic social orders, is no longer a sufficient support for intuition or flair on the contrary, the great man is he who establishes links between beings who are not only removed from one another, located in different universes, but also distant from his social background and the circle of his immediate relations, this is why, unlike the old bourgeois society, a capitalism that incorporates connexionist justifications accepts those who, thanks to a rather erratic career path (at least in their youth), have a fund of experience and are acquainted with several worlds, endowing them with considerable adaptability. 
1266	project	1266	1	Manually_gathered	the verdict delivered on the quality of a link does not take into account only the distance that it has made it possible to bridge - that is to say, its ex-ante probability (less likely links being more prized than very likely ones). 
1267	project	1267	1	Manually_gathered	it also takes account of the degree to which the link, once established, has proved fruitful ex-post, in the sense that its result is to refocus and extend the network by prompting the emergence of new links. 
1268	project	1268	1	Manually_gathered	in this way, we can distinguish between (a) links that are highly probable but largely unproductive, such as those established between the members of a clique, where the connections are compact and within everyone\'s reach, but define a self-enclosed set; (b) very probable but nevertheless productive links, in the sense that they open on to the outside world, such as the links that popularizers or journalists make; (c) links that are very unlikely but also very unproductive, such as those established by the misunderstood forerunner or, worse, the crank or madman who, finding no one to follow him, cannot operate as a key holder; and finally (d) links that are simultaneously unlikely and highly productive, which create the status of the innovator or audacious project head. 
1269	project	1269	1	Manually_gathered	all the instruments of connection <repertoire of objects and mechanisms> new technologies, informal relations, relations of trust, partnership, agreements, alliances, subcontracting, networks of firms, network firms, link, loop, synapses, neurons, projects  in a world where the principal operation is establishing connections, it is thus normal to find a marked presence of new communication technologies based on computer science (internet, interfaces, etc.). 
1270	project	1270	1	Manually_gathered	the same may be said of the mechanisms, primarily entrepreneurial mechanisms here (subcontracting, flexible organization, out-sourcing, autonomous units, franchises), which characterize the postmodern, \'re-engineered\', network, firm. 
1271	project	1271	1	Manually_gathered	the descriptive terminology of the connexionist world is pulled in two different directions: either towards a thematic of action without a subject, where the only entity that counts is the network, where what occurs is of the anonymous order of the id, of selforganization (,the organization increases its capacity for self-organization\'); or towards a neopersonalism, which emphasizes not the system, but human beings in search of meaning. 
1272	project	1272	1	Manually_gathered	given that what matters most is intangible, impalpable, informal- a term that characterizes both relations and the rules of the game, which are invented as one goes along - the most appropriate  
1273	project	1273	1	Manually_gathered	the general nature of the rhizomorphous form is declined by means of different metaphors, which refer either, in traditional fashion, to weaving (stitch, loop, knot); or to the devices in which fluids circulate (flow, oil pipeline, channel, electric cables); or, in more modern fashion, to the biology of the brain (synapses, neurons, etc.) 
1274	project	1274	1	Manually_gathered	this last register is employed in particular to emphasize the autonomy and even the volition of the network, which is stronger than that of the beings immersed in it, and whose properties are then described in the language of selforganization, self regulation, and spontaneous morphogenesis. 
1275	project	1275	1	Manually_gathered	finally, the project is indeed the central mechanism of the city that bears its name. 
1276	project	1276	1	Manually_gathered	it \'has at its disposal unity of time, but not unity of place. it must optimize internal resources, compare them with external resources, and make the best use of experts organized in network structures\' (hec, 1994).

1278	project	1278	1	Manually_gathered	different grounds for non-engagement identify different types of little person. 
1279	project	1279	1	Manually_gathered	given that trust and relational qualities are the cement of projects, the unemployable ones are those who do not know how to inspire trust, or cannot be trusted because they do not deliver what is expected of them, or do not circulate the information they possess and are \'out for themselves\' - which is a form of dishonesty in their engagement (opportunism). 
1280	project	1280	1	Manually_gathered	the basic rule is \'reciprocity: the best-intentioned are discouraged if they receive nothing in exchange for what they have given. anyone who retains information that could be useful to others to himself is a killer of networks\' (orgogozo, 1991). 
1281	project	1281	1	Manually_gathered	"likewise inferior are those who do not know how to communicate, because they are impervious or have fixed ideas, are authoritarian and intolerant, making them incapable if compromise. they resemble all \'the office miseries"", the sullen types, the individualists who withdraw into themselves, never go out, don\'t participate in the end-of-year drinks, shun cocktails, return to the hotel pronto, and plant themselves in front of the tele, that absolute ""network-killer\'"" (bellenger, 1992).

1282	project	1282	1	Manually_gathered	rigidity, which, as the converse of flexibility, in this world constitutes the main failing of little people, can have different origins. 
1283	project	1283	1	Manually_gathered	it can derive from attachment to a single project that it is impossible to let go of when a new project comes along; or from attachment to a place which, by rendering them immobile and rooting them in what is local, confines little people to the existing circle of links, and prevents them making new connections. 
1284	project	1284	1	Manually_gathered	finally, its origin can be found in a preference for security even at the expense of autonomy. 
1285	project	1285	1	Manually_gathered	thus, in a projective city someone who has a status is not mobile. 
1286	project	1286	1	Manually_gathered	someone who has a status knows what to expect from life: what their duties are (what is expected of them) and what their rights are (what they can expect of others).

1290	project	1290	1	Manually_gathered	the city falls when the network is no longer extended and, closing in on itself, benefits some people, but no longer serves the public good. 
1291	project	1291	1	Manually_gathered	this is the case when the networker keeps information to himself, weaves connections in secret, unbeknownst to his team, in order not to share the links he has established and retain the benefits for himself, avoiding a situation where others can pursue them without going through him (\'the most important adaptive function of a network consists in absorbing and redistributing information\' [landier, 1991]). 
1292	project	1292	1	Manually_gathered	this is the case with large bodies: \'for large bodies are today anti-networks inasmuch as they exercise authority over their members in order to further their own objectives\' (bellenger, 1992).

1318	project	1318	1	Manually_gathered	thus, it can be said of \'social and family networks\' that \'this capital represents relations which, in addition to satisfaction on a human level, offer a potential contribution to the enterprise envisaged\' (aubrey, 1994). but while connections with members of the extended family, assimilated to a network, can prove profitable, the restricted family, like the group of \'old mates\' or the clique of \'office neighbours\', preserves the tie to old, superseded connections, and by that token represents a burden, a handicap. 
1319	project	1319	1	Manually_gathered	great men in the projective city are also streamlined in that they are liberated from the burden of their own passions and values: open to differences (unlike rigid, absolutist personalities attached to the defence of universal values). 
1320	project	1320	1	Manually_gathered	for the same reasons, they are not critical (except when it comes to defending tolerance and difference). 
1321	project	1321	1	Manually_gathered	nothing must get the upper hand over the imperative of adjustment, or hamper their movements. 
1322	project	1322	1	Manually_gathered	they are determined exclusively by factors deriving from the situation and connections they are caught up in, which completely define them. 
1323	project	1323	1	Manually_gathered	the tolerance required to adjust to others can also be expressed in terms of emancipation from \'bourgeois morality\', the streamlined human being has learnt from psychoanalysis - and, more generally, from the diffusion of \'interpretation as exercise of suspicion\' - that one must know how to free oneself from moralism by casting suspicion on the hidden motives involved in moralizing ventures and acknowledging the validity of ambivalence. 
1324	project	1324	1	Manually_gathered	the numerous tools of analytical provenance integrated into the projective city thus aim to develop realism: they serve to look reality in the face - including (or especially) the reality of desire, treated as one datum among others - but also, by the same token, to recognize the limits placed on desire by reality. 
1325	project	1325	1	Manually_gathered	in a network world, it is thus realistic to be ambivalent (in contrast to the boss who is all of one piece in the hierarchical world), because the situations people have to confront are themselves complex and uncertain. 
1326	project	1326	1	Manually_gathered	according to the same principle of eliminating anything that might hinder mobility, the streamlined human being must not be attached to a burdensome patrimony, and should prefer to ownership other formulas that provide access to the enjoyment of objects, such as renting. 
1327	project	1327	1	Manually_gathered	in this instance, distance with respect to ownership does not derive from some ascetic contempt for material goods, which it is perfectly licit to have at one\'s disposal and to enjoy, but is simply the result of the need to streamline oneself so that one can move around easily. 
1328	project	1328	1	Manually_gathered	for the same reasons, connexionist man likewise tends not to let himself be trapped by institutions, with all the various obligations that entails, and not to allow himself to become entangled in a web of responsibilities towards the other people or organizations he has responsibility for. 
1329	project	1329	1	Manually_gathered	that is why he prefers to renounce official power in favour of network forms of power, freed of the constraints of supervision, invigilation, management, representation, and respect for the state rules regulating the use of goods and the management of human beings. 
1330	project	1330	1	Manually_gathered	he leaves that to others, for he prefers autonomy to security. 
1331	project	1331	1	Manually_gathered	great men in the projective city likewise renounce exercising any form of domination over others by taking advantage of statutory or hierarchical properties that would vouchsafe them ready recognition. 
1332	project	1332	1	Manually_gathered	their authority depends exclusively on their competence. 
1333	project	1333	1	Manually_gathered	they do not impose their rules or objectives, but agree to discuss their positions (principle of tolerance). 
1334	project	1334	1	Manually_gathered	underlying these different forms of renunciation, we find a more basic sacrifice: that of personality, in the sense of a manner of being that expresses itself in similar attitudes and conduct whatever the circumstances. 
1335	project	1335	1	Manually_gathered	"\'the image of the chameleon is a tempting one for describing the pro, who knows how to conduct his relationships in order to reach other people more easily \' adaptability is the key to the network spirit (efforts have to be made to take the first step), (bellenger, 1992). """
1336	project	1336	1	Manually_gathered	streamlined people sacrifice a certain interiority and fidelity to the self, the better to adjust to the people with whom they come into contact and to the ever-changing situations in which they are obliged to act (this also assumes renunciation of the hubris of calculate on in favour of a limited rationality).

1339	project	1339	1	Manually_gathered	<model test> people cannot be judged on the basis of a single project, because their status reveals itself in the model test and this, as we already know, is the transition from one project to the next. 
1340	project	1340	1	Manually_gathered	it is when a project is finished that the key holders are revealed and an appraisal is conducted. 
1341	project	1341	1	Manually_gathered	appraisal is positive in the case of those who, having enhanced their reputation in the course of the project they are leaving, succeed in integrating themselves into a new one. 
1342	project	1342	1	Manually_gathered	contrariwise, it is negative when an inability to maintain or develop links and to liaise with others disqualifies the applicant.

1344	project	1344	1	Manually_gathered	by way of sanction, links can always be unilaterally withdrawn by those with whom they are made. 
1345	project	1345	1	Manually_gathered	if the moment of the transition from one project to another constitutes the test par excellence, in the logic of a projective city the world is the more testing and hence also the more just - the shorter, the more numerous, and the more changeable projects are.

1348	project	1348	1	Manually_gathered	those from whom nothing is to be expected are avoided, kept at a distance or, more simply, ignored. 
1349	project	1349	1	Manually_gathered	one of the peculiarities of network forms is that, unlike what occurs in totalities defined by an inscription of spatial order in a territory (nations, districts, etc.), of temporal order in a history (lineage), or of legal order in an institution (administrations, churches, etc.), those who are depreciated lose all visibility and even, in a way, any existence. 
1350	project	1350	1	Manually_gathered	for in the logic of this world, existence itself is a relational attribute: every entity, and human persons by the same token as the rest, exists to a greater or lesser extent depending upon the number and value of the connections that pass via it. 
1351	project	1351	1	Manually_gathered	this is why such a world has no sanctions other than rejection or exclusion, which, in depriving someone of their links (,disaffiliation\', in robert castel\'s terminology), expels them to the margins of the network, where connections are at once both sparse and worthless. 
1352	project	1352	1	Manually_gathered	the excluded person is someone who depends on others, but on whom no one any longer depends, who is not wanted by anyone, who is no longer sought after, no longer invited, who, even if his address book is full of names, has disappeared from other people\'s address books. 
1353	project	1353	1	Manually_gathered	it follows that in such a world the mechanisms of justice are essentially preventive.

1356	project	1356	1	Manually_gathered	the question of a city\'s anchorage in a definition of nature is a crucial one. 
1357	project	1357	1	Manually_gathered	first of all, it is important on the level of justice that all human beings have the ability to achieve better conditions, and only a definition of human nature guarantees the sharing of this ability by the whole of humanity. 
1358	project	1358	1	Manually_gathered	the <dignity of persons> refers to this dimension in each city; it is what makes for equality and points towards the natural human properties that give everyone the same opportunity to achieve greatness if they do what is required - in particular, if they make the indicated sacrifices (compare the <formula of investment. 
1359	project	1359	1	Manually_gathered	the need to connect < dignity of persons> all the active operators in a network can accede to better conditions, because they all possess the ability to connect with others. 
1360	project	1360	1	Manually_gathered	the desire to connect is a basic property of human nature. 
1361	project	1361	1	Manually_gathered	in this anthropology, all women and all men are beings of contacts and relations: \'attachment is not the result of a libidinal or learning process . 
1362	project	1362	1	Manually_gathered	it corresponds to a primary tendency - the need for others - which is stronger than hunger and earlier than sexuality\' (bellenger, 1992). 
1363	project	1363	1	Manually_gathered	this need for connection, which is so universal, is the reason why everyone can integrate themselves into networks and acquire employability. 
1364	project	1364	1	Manually_gathered	no one is excluded a priori. 
1365	project	1365	1	Manually_gathered	functioning in networks also satisfies the highly human characteristic of wanting to be simultaeously free and engaged: \'[a]ll of us make commitments.

1368	project	1368	1	Manually_gathered	without this radical duality that each of us bears within ourselves, the series of engagements and disengagements supposed by the projective city would seem absolutely inhuman. 
1369	project	1369	1	Manually_gathered	in the case of the projective city, the <harmonious figure of natural order> is obviously the network, or rather, the networks that have always existed in the life of human beings.

1374	project	1374	1	Manually_gathered	the moment for its rehabilitation has now arrived: in the traditional firm, it had an unofficial, even clandestine character, which was deemed subversive of the official hierarchical organization.

1376	project	1376	1	Manually_gathered	informal networks were thus directed against hierarchy; the objective was to defend oneself against decisions that were resented as irrational or unjust.

2682	market	2682	1	Manually_gathered	worthy objects are salable goods that have a strong position in a market. 
2683	market	2683	1	Manually_gathered	worthy persons are rich, millionaires, and they live the high life.

2686	market	2686	1	Manually_gathered	the deployment of market worth is inscribed in a space that has neither limits nor distance, in which the circulation of goods and persons is free.

2694	market	2694	1	Manually_gathered	the state of unworthiness is one in which persons fail, stagnate, and lose out, and in which goods are rejected, spurned, hated, instead of desired.

2702	market	2702	1	Manually_gathered	in the manual we are using, the author recounts a scene in which the participants are playing with the limits of humanity and having fun by attributing to nonhuman beings this dignity of desire, this capacity to love or to hate. 
2703	market	2703	1	Manually_gathered	"at an annual sales convention, the president of a dog food company summed up the situation this way: \'over the past few days,\' he began, \'we\'ve heard from all our division heads and of their wonderful plans for the coming year. if we have the best advertising, the best marketing, the best sales force, how come we sell less goddamn dog food than anyone else in the business?\' absolute silence filled the convention hall. finally, after what seemed like forever, a small voice answered from the back of the room: \'because the dogs hate it\'"" (117).

2704	market	2704	1	Manually_gathered	since dignity designates a capacity to participate in a common good, the fact that it takes the form of a selfish desire in the market world is almost paradoxical. 
2705	market	2705	1	Manually_gathered	by recognizing dignity in persons occupied with satisfying their self-centered desires, utilitarian philosophy has contributed to establishing the modem image of the individual detached from the chains of belonging and liberated from the weight of hierarchies.

2709	market	2709	1	Manually_gathered	the market world is thus populated with individuals seeking to satisfy desires; they are in turn clients_ and competitors, buyers, and sellers, entering into relations with one another as businessmen. 
2710	market	2710	1	Manually_gathered	the fact that the deployment of objects is required for market coordination becomes obvious, in contrast, when the identity of market objects is lacking. 
2711	market	2711	1	Manually_gathered	an object of a market nature is a thing toward which competing desires for possession converge: it is a desirable, salable, marketable thing. 
2712	market	2712	1	Manually_gathered	the identification that is common to market objects inscribes them as inalienable property, objects that are common to diverse desires. 
2713	market	2713	1	Manually_gathered	let us note that of all the social sciences, economics is the one that grants the most space to objects, although the status of these objects is not made clear in economic theory. 
2714	market	2714	1	Manually_gathered	market goods are so natural that their role is rarely addressed, apart from considerations about public or collective goods. 
2715	market	2715	1	Manually_gathered	recent theoretical developments regarding the quality of goods do touch on the crucial hypothesis of a common identification of objects, but the problems raised are reduced to a matter of asymmetrical information. 
2716	market	2716	1	Manually_gathered	the value of the item is determined in a market test, and problems dealt with as instances of cheating on real quality are raised by the implicit reference to a different form of value, often industrial in nature (eymard duvernay 1989b, p. 12 7). 
2717	market	2717	1	Manually_gathered	similarly, the implications of a theoretical slippage from a market of goods to a market of contracts are not clearly distinguished, since the role of the hypothesis of the objectivity of a medium for the expression of competing desires is not taken into account. 
2718	market	2718	1	Manually_gathered	the common identification of objects of a market nature is closely linked to the requirements of aggrandizement in a market world, to the investment formula that ensures access to the common good by means of a sacrifice. 
2719	market	2719	1	Manually_gathered	the selfishness of subjects in the market world has to go hand in hand, if any order is to result from their competition, with clear-sightedness as to the limits of selves; this is the other side of the picture, where the common identification of external goods is concerned. 
2720	market	2720	1	Manually_gathered	this requirement, often forgotten in methodological or political approaches to individualism, is the one that defines the individual as a social being, socialized by desires that converge toward external goods. 
2721	market	2721	1	Manually_gathered	in the market world, people are thus detached from one another (and in particular from any domestic bond), liberated in such a way that they lend themselves willingly to every opportunity to engage in a transaction. 
2722	market	2722	1	Manually_gathered	in short, subjects are as available as goods on the market. 
2723	market	2723	1	Manually_gathered	here, too, the adoption of this approach to the market world makes it possible to dispel ambiguities about freedom and liberalism. 
2724	market	2724	1	Manually_gathered	it might be preferable to recognize that the freedom of free-market liberalism has meaning only insofar as it is an expression of choice for external goods, and that this externality is acquired only if one starts out with a detachment that presupposes seeing others the way one sees oneself.

2739	market	2739	1	Manually_gathered	the transaction presupposes that people have enough perspective and that the object is detached enough to allow the play of competition with others.

2748	market	2748	1	Manually_gathered	the test is also an opportunity to extract new objects from chaos, to discover new things that might interest a client and give rise to a transaction and opportunity to extend the market world. 
2749	market	2749	1	Manually_gathered	the common identification of goods and the generality of the worth known as price associates the face-to-face aspect of a business deal with other transactions taking place elsewhere, with other individuals; these can thus be equated.

3704	industrial	3704	1	Manually_gathered	another category of justifications includes arguments where evaluations depend on technical efficiency and professionalism, planning, and longterm investment in infrastructure. 
3705	industrial	3705	1	Manually_gathered	this category relates to the industrial order of worth in the boltanski and thevenot (1991) scheme, but industrial here is not limited to the industrial economic sector. 
3706	industrial	3706	1	Manually_gathered	while technical competency and planning arguments are sometimes connected as such to economic outcomes, the bases for evaluation in this category are different from market criteria. 
3707	industrial	3707	1	Manually_gathered	technical competency justifications place value based on the efficiency of investments, professional planning and expertise, and long-term growth. 
3708	industrial	3708	1	Manually_gathered	the form of proof for planning justifications is long-term investment and technical or scientific competency.  
3709	industrial	3709	1	Manually_gathered	they envision nature as a scarce economic resource with multiple potential uses energy, recreation, income for the county which must be used efficiently. 
3710	industrial	3710	1	Manually_gathered	also, both sides utilize a form of proof which is congruent with technical competency justifications the use of scientific expertise and evidence to validate opposite arguments, for example on the question of whether the dam will hurt or help the clavey fish populations. 
3711	industrial	3711	1	Manually_gathered	the project is defended because of the necessity of providing roads, tunnels, and other infrastructure in order for there to be economic growth in the future. this sort of industrial planning argument is extremely influential as an argument for the tunnel project in france, and reflects the well-documented embrace of an engineering mentality or technocratic approach by the french state. 
3712	industrial	3712	1	Manually_gathered	this strong compromise of technical industrial justifications closely connects technocratic planning by the state with the general interest, and this approach is perpetuated through the training of elites in engineering schools for high positions in the state.. 
3713	industrial	3713	1	Manually_gathered	they are both based on the same type of test the long-term efficiency of the project with the same criteria of proof and instruments of evidence (technical evidence from modeling and statistical analysis). 
3714	industrial	3714	1	Manually_gathered	for example, hydropower projects in france were were judged based on their efficiency as long-term investments. in the industrial city, for example, the common superior principle is efficiency. 
3715	industrial	3715	1	Manually_gathered	it can be said: \'in terms of efficiency, x is equivalent to y\'. 
3716	industrial	3716	1	Manually_gathered	similarly, using this same convention, it can be said that \'z is superior or inferior to x\'. 
3717	industrial	3717	1	Manually_gathered	thus, identification of the common superior principle in a city leads us straight to the <condition of great man>, the great man being the one who embodies the city\'s values, as well as to the <condition of little person>, defined by the absence of such values. 
3718	industrial	3718	1	Manually_gathered	thus, someone situated in an \'industrial\' world will readily refer    to \'instruments\', \'methods\', \'measures\' or \'procedures\', invoke \'engineers\' and \'specialists\', and list \'controlling\' or \'organizing\' as among the actions worth performing.

3729	industrial	3729	1	Manually_gathered	their relationships can be said to be harmonious when organized, measurable, functional, standardized. the industrial world is the one in which technological objects and scientific methods have their place. 
3730	industrial	3730	1	Manually_gathered	the terminology adopted must thus not lead to the assumption that this world is fully inscribed within the limits of industry. 
3731	industrial	3731	1	Manually_gathered	conversely, the workings of an industrial enterprise cannot be understood on the basis of resources stemming from this world alone, even if the aim of efficient production based on functional investments finds its justification in the industrial order. 
3732	industrial	3732	1	Manually_gathered	if, as we shall see, a canonical judgment as to the quality of a scientific phenomenon allows us to illustrate the reality test of the industrial world, the fact remains that the development and diffusion of a discovery cannot be justified simply by the test examined here; these phenomena exceed the framework of the industrial world by a wide margin. 
3733	industrial	3733	1	Manually_gathered	works on the history or the sociology of science and technology bring out the heterogeneity of the resources and actions involved in the processes of innovation, and they are even joined today, on this point, by economic approaches to technological change. 
3734	industrial	3734	1	Manually_gathered	certain actions are inscribed in an industrial test where the intent is to establish scientific proof. 
3735	industrial	3735	1	Manually_gathered	others are implicated in the peak moment when a singular phenomenon emerges, an innovation announcing a break with tradition according to an inspired justification. 
3736	industrial	3736	1	Manually_gathered	still others rely on the worth of fame, a worth that implies a concentration of credit in terms of public opinion based on distinctive signs and marks; others depend on the venerability of domestic bonds guaranteeing a solid reputation or on the establishment of market value in an immediate response to clients\' desires. 
3737	industrial	3737	1	Manually_gathered	just as the recognition of the market order is obscured by a misunderstanding of the conventions that accompany the affirmation of an individual, the understanding of the industrial order is blocked by a treatment of technological objects that locks them into an instrumental relation to nature and fails to examine the conventions supporting agreement about the scientific phenomenon in question. 
3738	industrial	3738	1	Manually_gathered	the observation of the conditions under which industrial objects are put to work shows that they lend themselves to the same type of test as the one already identified in the other universes. 
3739	industrial	3739	1	Manually_gathered	testing these beings and establishing their objectivity presupposes a detour through a collective form, a higher common principle that governs the way they are judged. 
3740	industrial	3740	1	Manually_gathered	by highlighting this industrial test, we are distancing ourselves both from an approach in which science and technology are openings onto an external world, and from a radical relativism that construes facts as arbitrary beliefs attached to communities.

3756	industrial	3756	1	Manually_gathered	this scale of qualification underlies a hierarchy of states of worth, a hierarchy marked by competencies and responsibilities (management, leaders, decision makers, supervisors, technicians, operators, and so on). in work relations and systems of remuneration, the formal qualities that express industrial worth are opposed both to a market evaluation that would result immediately from a service provided and to a domestic judgment that would evaluate a person\'s authority.

6630	green	1304	1	pdf	a main driver behind the development of these concepts has been the move towards a more integrated and holistic approach to incorporating environment and development in economic decision making policy and planning.
6631	green	1305	1	pdf	whilst the terms green economy and green growth might imply a strong focus on the intersection between environment and the economy many of the definitions of these terms from recent publications clearly also incorporate a social emphasis see appendix.

6640	green	1314	1	pdf	in this regard low carbon development can be seen as a subset of both green growth and green economy.
6641	green	1315	1	pdf	importantly many definitions of green economy include a united nations. a guide to the green economy reference to ecological limits or planetary boundaries which are references to the scientific article which identifies nine planetary boundaries that define the safe operating space for humanity with respect to the earth system and associated with the planet s biophysical subsystems or processes see rockstrom et al .
6642	green	1316	1	pdf	interestingly this reference has not been included in definitions of green growth.
6643	green	1317	1	pdf	the international chamber of commerce propose a key difference between green growth and green economy i.e.
6644	green	1318	1	pdf	that green growth is a bottom up approach of greening products processes services technologies and supply chains compared with the top down approach of green economy which involves strategic macro economic policies addressing systemic challenges.
6645	green	1319	1	pdf	others highlight that green growth more so than the multidimensional concept of green economy represents a new global compromise position which may be seen as a weak step forward but one that has the potential to unite many different factions around a goal that many see as transformative atkisson .
6646	green	1320	1	pdf	overall the various definitions of green growth and green economy are generally consistent both having sustainable development as their ultimate objective and being a means to reconcile the economic and environmental pillars without ignoring social aspects world bank .
6647	green	1321	1	pdf	as such the distinction between the terms is probably of little relevance.
6648	green	1322	1	pdf	however the approaches to green economy and green growth can be seen to cover a spectrum of different shades of green  from narrow concerns about climate change on the one hand in line with initial approaches to low carbon growth  to larger critiques of the environmental sustainability of modern capitalism on the other green growth leaders .
6649	green	1323	1	pdf	in other words and from a scientific perspective the focus varies between addressing one of the planetary boundaries defined by scientists i.e.
6650	green	1324	1	pdf	climate change to more holistically addressing the wider range of resource and ecological limits and the general state of the planet.
6651	green	1325	1	pdf	of course green economy has not been without its critics.
6652	green	1326	1	pdf	criticisms raised include that the concept should not compete with or displace sustainable development and internationally agreed principles that it implies a focus on environmental and economic dimensions to the detriment of the social dimension that it will lead to the financialisation of nature as well as further concentration of market power and global inequality third world network  lander .
6653	green	1327	1	pdf	other risks associated with green economy include that it may attempt to treat countries in the same manner i.e.
6654	green	1328	1	pdf	be based on a one size fits all approach  that it may result in trade protectionism that through it some countries may attempt to gain enhanced market access for their products achieving commercial advantage and that it may place new conditionalities on developing countries for aid loans and debt relief khor .

6657	green	1331	1	pdf	more recent references to an equitable green economy or inclusive green growth are clearly attempting more holistically to integrate the three dimensions of sustainable development for example see the no to the green economy campaign http nogreeneconomy.org en united nations. a guide to the green economy into these concepts to allay these concerns.
6658	green	1332	1	pdf	however it has also been pointed out that whilst this has been an important development if one follows this track the green economy concept would incorporate so many additional aspects that the concept would become equivalent to sustainable development itself in that sense why bother condezey .
6659	green	1333	1	pdf	perhaps a key benefit of the emergence of the green economy concept has been that it has stimulated international attention and renewed global efforts to transform our current unsustainable economic model into one which better aligns with the overarching goals of sustainable development.
6660	green	1334	1	pdf	importantly this has included efforts by international organizations major groups think tanks and researchers both supporters and critics alike to develop operational principles for green economy and green growth as well as the elaboration of policy toolkits and suites of measures that can be adopted by national governments to shift to a more sustainable economic framework.
6661	green	1335	1	pdf	there is also an emerging international practice as national governments in all regions adopt what could be classified as green economy policies with some countries taking a leading role in developing overarching national green economy strategies that integrate with long term development strategies.
6662	green	1336	1	pdf	in this regard the green economy and related concepts have succeeded in reinvigorating global debate on how to redefine our economic model to achieve the overarching agreed goal of sustainable development.
6663	green	1337	1	pdf	it is likely that the concepts of green economy and green growth will further converge in coming years and continue to gather momentum as more influential international organizations as well as national governments adopt the concepts into their programs and policy agendas.
6664	green	1338	1	pdf	during this process it will be critical that proponents of green economy effectively take onboard the concerns raised and address the risks associated with the concept.
6665	green	1339	1	pdf	the development of agreed green economy principles policy toolkits and databases of good practice will contribute in this regard.
