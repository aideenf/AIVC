Manually_gathered	green
851	1	in france the idea of domesticated nature is not necessarily set against untouched wilderness as in the united states while the clavey debate often concerns separating what is to be untouched and what is not this is not always the case in the somport debate and there are instead connections made between the domestic life of the valley and its natural life.	Manually_gathered	green

865	1	the attachment to the pyrenean bear is understandable because it holds a special place of honor in this region it plays a central role in local customs such as carnivals and it was a feared threat to humans particularly farmers and shepherds but also the prized prey of local bear hunting heroes.

866	1	the bears became a famous symbol of the project opposition they were described as the last of their kind and endangered  and were considered deserving of protection because they had lived in the area for a long time (a somewhat different characterization to the legal sense of endangered species in the united states).

4675	1	great men in the projective city are also streamlined in that they are liberated from the burden of their own passions and values: open to differences (unlike rigid absolutist personalities attached to the defence of universal values).	Manually_gathered	project
4676	1	great men in the projective city likewise renounce exercising any form of domination over others by taking advantage of statutory or hierarchical properties that would vouchsafe them ready recognition.	Manually_gathered	project
4677	1	great men past masters when it comes to self monitoring know how to judge \'other people\'s emotional states more lucidly and are perceived in their turn as more friendly open less uneasy less anxious less nervous in their relationships\'.	Manually_gathered	project

4696	1	in a network world however there can be no question of an overarching representation.	Manually_gathered	project
4697	1	in a network world it is thus realistic to be ambivalent (in contrast to the boss who is all of one piece in the hierarchical world) because the situations people have to confront are themselves complex and uncertain.	Manually_gathered	project
4698	1	in a network world where the more unpredictable and remote connections are the more likely they are to prove profitable the class habitus on which the spontaneous convergence of tastes relies in predominantly domestic social orders is no longer a sufficient support for intuition or flair on the contrary the great man is he who establishes links between beings who are not only removed from one another located in different universes but also distant from his social background and the circle of his immediate relations this is why unlike the old bourgeois society a capitalism that incorporates connexionist justifications accepts those who thanks to a rather erratic career path (at least in their youth) have a fund of experience and are acquainted with several worlds endowing them with considerable adaptability.	Manually_gathered	project
4699	1	in a projective city access to the condition of great man presupposes sacrificing anything that might impede availability that is to say the ability to engage in a new project.	Manually_gathered	project
4700	1	in a projective city the general equivalent what the status of persons and things is measured by is activity.	Manually_gathered	project
4701	1	in fact links are a form of capital that does not belong to those who have the use of them.	Manually_gathered	project
4702	1	in fact since the network has no overarching representation actions in it are always embedded in the contingency of a present situation.	Manually_gathered	project
4703	1	in respect of links it\'s all one.	Manually_gathered	project
4704	1	in so doing creators of links temporarily find themselves in the position of keyholder since all those who in turn want to cross the boundaries they have traversed will for a certain period of time have to go through them.	Manually_gathered	project
4705	1	in such a context everyone can \'constantly and increasingly improve their employability both through these technical skills and their ability for teamwork even and especially when these teams are flexible neural and rarely made up of the same individuals.	Manually_gathered	project
4706	1	in the case of the projective city the <harmonious figure of natural order> is obviously the network or rather the networks that have always existed in the life of human beings.	Manually_gathered	project
4707	1	in the knowledge that time is limited it is in fact advisable to carve out the time to forge links with different persons and universes rather than always remaining in the same circle of people: \'being a pro means revising one\'s accessibility in quasi strategic fashion time can\'t just be invented and so it is a question of making choices and daring to take decisions a pro\'s appointments are handled with extreme care\' (bellenger ).	Manually_gathered	project
4708	1	in the logic of the city the great are not only those who excel at exploiting the specific resources connected with a world but also those who place the capacities disclosed in tests at the service of the common good.	Manually_gathered	project
4709	1	in this anthropology all women and all men are beings of contacts and relations: \'attachment is not the result of a libidinal or learning process.	Manually_gathered	project
4710	1	in this city the great man is a \'plunderer of ideas\' (serieyx ).	Manually_gathered	project
4711	1	in this instance distance with respect to ownership does not derive from some ascetic contempt for material goods which it is perfectly licit to have at one\'s disposal and to enjoy but is simply the result of the need to streamline oneself so that one can move around easily.	Manually_gathered	project
4712	1	in this sense all the sacrifices that are made have the effect of enhancing the streamlined character of entities of persons but also of things in order to favour their reorganization when the next project comes along.	Manually_gathered	project
4713	1	in this way \'employability can be guaranteed that is to say a level of skills and flexibility allowing each individual to find a new job inside or outside the firm\' (aubrey ) employability is thus \'a gift in return from the firm to individuals who are aware of their responsibilities in it\' (aubrey ).	Manually_gathered	project
4714	1	in this way we can distinguish between (a) links that are highly probable but largely unproductive such as those established between the members of a clique where the connections are compact and within everyone\'s reach but define a self enclosed set (b) very probable but nevertheless productive links in the sense that they open on to the outside world such as the links that popularizers or journalists make (c) links that are very unlikely but also very unproductive such as those established by the misunderstood forerunner or worse the crank or madman who finding no one to follow him cannot operate as a key holder and finally (d) links that are simultaneously unlikely and highly productive which create the status of the innovator or audacious project head.	Manually_gathered	project
4715	1	in very general terms this is true of all those who playing an active role in the expansion and animation of networks act as mediators whether characterized as strategic brokers able to \'make strategic exchanges outside of hierarchy and boundaries\' (aubrey ) as partners of the third kind (archier et al ) or as tangential contributors.	Manually_gathered	project
4716	1	in view of the issues with the swagger codegen..

4722	1	it also takes account of the degree to which the link once established has proved fruitful ex post in the sense that its result is to refocus and extend the network by prompting the emergence of new links.	Manually_gathered	project
4723	1	it can be alluded to in partial terms whenever there is co ordination in real time with others who are spatially distant (\'the starting point will be to ignore geographical distances\' fapscott and caston ) particularly by taking full advantage of modern means of communication (the internet) as we see in the example of the \'global laboratory\' which is not geographically located and allows researchers in the same discipline but scattered throughout the \'world to collaborate in solving the same problem.	Manually_gathered	project
4724	1	it can be referred to in temporal terms when old dormant connections are reactivated.	Manually_gathered	project
4725	1	it can derive from attachment to a single project that it is impossible to let go of when a new project comes along or from attachment to a place which by rendering them immobile and rooting them in what is local confines little people to the existing circle of links and prevents them making new connections.

4729	1	it is important to sweep away the networks of buddies bureaucracy or corruption that obstruct the path of progress\' (aubrey ).	Manually_gathered	project
4730	1	it is precisely because the project is a transient form that it is adjusted to a network world: by multiplying connections and proliferating links the succession of projects has the effect of extending networks.	Manually_gathered	project

4767	1	terminating a project without worrying about what becomes of those who have participated in it is unworthy of a great man.	Manually_gathered	project
4768	1	that is to say: in the projective city they are not only those who know how to engage but also those who are able to engage others to offer involvement to make it desirable to follow them because they inspire trust they are charismatic their vision generates enthusiasm.

4776	1	the descriptive terminology of the connexionist world is pulled in two different directions: either towards a thematic of action without a subject where the only entity that counts is the network where what occurs is of the anonymous order of the id of selforganization ( the organization increases its capacity for self organization\') or towards a neopersonalism which emphasizes not the system but human beings in search of meaning.

4788	1	the great man in the projective city retains the initiative in his projects and knows how to take nsks in order to make connections to be forever making new contacts that are full of possibilities: \'thus the idea of a link seems to pros rather like a vein or seam to exploit in tile manner of a gold prospecter you never quite know what is at the end of it.

4832	1	this is one of the ways in which the projective city can win over forces hostile to capitalism: by proposing a grammar that transcends it which they in turn will use to describe their own activity while remaining oblivious of the fact that capitalism too can slip into it.	Manually_gathered	project
4833	1	this is the case when the networker keeps information to himself weaves connections in secret unbeknownst to his team in order not to share the links he has established and retain the benefits for himself avoiding a situation where others can pursue them without going through him (\'the most important adaptive function of a network consists in absorbing and redistributing information\' landier ).	Manually_gathered	project
4834	1	this is the case with large bodies: \'for large bodies are today anti networks inasmuch as they exercise authority over their members in order to further their own objectives\' (bellenger ).	Manually_gathered	project
4835	1	this is the price of co ordinating themselves in mechanisms and projects.	Manually_gathered	project
4836	1	this is to say that in a network world there is a close correlation between the importance of social capital and of information capital.	Manually_gathered	project
4837	1	this is why engagement is conceived as voluntary.	Manually_gathered	project
4838	1	this is why such a world has no sanctions other than rejection or exclusion which in depriving someone of their links ( disaffiliation\' in robert castel\'s terminology) expels them to the margins of the network where connections are at once both sparse and worthless.	Manually_gathered	project
4839	1	this last register is employed in particular to emphasize the autonomy and even the volition of the network which is stronger than that of the beings immersed in it and whose properties are then described in the language of selforganization self regulation and spontaneous morphogenesis.

4846	1	thus \'the leaner organization that contracts out for services depends on the suppliers of those services and therefore benefits from close co operation with them\' (moss kanter ).	Manually_gathered	project
4847	1	thus in a projective city someone who has a status is not mobile.	Manually_gathered	project
4848	1	thus it can be said of \'social and family networks\' that \'this capital represents relations which in addition to satisfaction on a human level offer a potential contribution to the enterprise envisaged\' (aubrey ). but while connections with members of the extended family assimilated to a network can prove profitable the restricted family like the group of \'old mates\' or the clique of \'office neighbours\' preserves the tie to old superseded connections and by that token represents a burden a handicap.	Manually_gathered	project
4849	1	thus whereas the expert is above all rich in links of the first (temporal) or second (spatial) types the project head or source of inspiration excels in establishing connections between domains or fields: he establishes collaboration between people from different disciplines or professions belonging to various departments institutions or firms and brings together for example two experts each of whom has experience but in different domains.
