31	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	another distinct category of arguments relies on justifications where traditions are valued and are constantly being revisited in making judgments about the present, and where locality and ties to a place are revered. 
32	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	evaluations of this type support hierarchies of reputation and trustworthiness. 
33	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	these justifications relate to what boltanski and thevenot (1991) term the domestic order of worth in which the claim of a general value is warranted by personal tie or local attachment, so that personal character or proximity are considered the source or building blocks of universal goods. 
34	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	in the french case, arguments of this sort are found in the call by project opponents to protect the region’s treasured culture and heritage (patrimoine in french), of which the valley’s landscape is a significant part. 
35	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	in the american case there are many similar arguments pointing to the preservation of a place close to one’s home and hearth, and references to the region’s heritage. 
36	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	but these arguments are oriented less around the idea of heritage and patrimony in the united states and more in terms of the protection of one’s backyard. 
37	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	justifications based on tradition and locality are utilized extensively by opponents of the somport project in france, and there are a variety of rich testimonials from the inhabitants of the aspe valley on the need to preserve a patrimony and way of life cherished by many and upheld in various ways by existing traditions of the region.

40	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	the domestic world was extracted from a commentary of bossuet\'s work, la politique tiree des propres paroles de l\'ecriture sainte. 
41	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	in a domestic world, people\'s worth depends on a hierarchy of trust based on a chain of personal dependencies. 
42	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	the political link between beings is seen as a generalization of kinship and is based on face-to-face relationships and on the respect for tradition. 
43	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	the person, cannot, in this world, be separated from his/her belonging to a body, a family, a lineage, an estate. 
44	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	in bossuet\'s political construction, the king, who is the greatest being, is comparable with a father, who sacrifices himself for his subjects. 
45	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	in this model one must, to evaluate someone\'s worth, know his place in the network of dependencies from which this person draws his own authority. 
46	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	in order to describe the objects of the domestic world of the present, we used a practical guide teaching good manners and human relations within the company, intended for socially mobile workers who had been promoted to more responsible positions (entitled savoir vivre et promotion). 
47	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	in this book, important and worthy persons are chiefs, bosses, or even relatives. 
48	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	their main qualities are to be distinguished, straightforward, faithful and to have character. 
49	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	the typical objects are, for instance, visiting cards, gifts, estates, houses, titles.

62	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	 family ceremonies (test) celebration, birth, death, marriage, social events, conversation, distinction, nomination. 
63	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	the domestic world does not unfold inside the circle of family relationships alone, especially given the restricted notion of family, detached from any reference to the political order, that is accepted in our society today. 
64	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	when this world unfolds, the search for what is just stresses personal relationships. 
65	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	the worth that, in the domestic world is a function of the position one occupies m chains of personal dependence can only be grasped in a relational sense: worthier than ... , less worthy than... for the same reasons, the exercise of worth is subject here to constraints of place and time linked to the need to present oneself in person in the presence of others, in order to manifest one\'s own importance. 
66	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	this need underlies the interest taken in everything having to do with the body, its clothing and its presentation. 
67	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	arrangements of a domestic nature are weakly equipped with instruments for acting from a distance; such instruments are particularly well developed, in contrast, in the civic world, which lays emphasis on the objectivity of rules detached from persons and on mechanisms of representation. 
68	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	in the domestic world, objects are not apprehended according to their own worth, as is the case in the industrial world, but essentially according to how much they contribute to establishing hierarchical relations among people (we find examples in objects used in the context of social encounters) and also, according to the degree to which they facilitate the inscription. 
69	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	of the worth and thus the identification of personal counters. 
70	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	in the domestic world, where beings are immediately qualified according to their worth, in such a way that their manifestation necessarily entails a determination of their position in a hierarchy, the inscription of signs of worth in the form of titles, heraldry, clothing, marks on the body, and so on, is sought in order to limit the uncertainty of situations involving personal encounters and to reduce the costs of identification. 
71	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	but the importance that the processes of inscription take on tends to attach worth to persons. 
72	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	the case of irrevocable titles and especially hereditary titles is exemplary: such titles render critiques powerless, because in most instances they cannot reach their intended goal, namely, the institution of a new test. 
73	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	"tests thus often take the form of confirmations; this is apparent in the archaic expressions of the domestic world offered by fairy tales, which are saturated with anecdotes in which a worthy person, disguised as someone of lesser worth, is subjected to a test that reveals his own inherent worthiness (for example, the princess and the pea""). """
74	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	it is through reference to generation, tradition, and hierarchy that order can be established among beings of a domestic nature. 
75	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	these three terms themselves are in a relation of equivalence, because the bond of personal dependence that connects a less worthy person with a superior-always constructed in the image of the father, whose state of worth is highest because he is the incarnation of the tradition-can be conceived in more than one way: since the worthiest person is found at the point of origin, the bond can be read as a link either in the chain of generations or in a hierarchical chain. 
76	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	in domestic worth, beings in a state of worthiness achieve superiority in each of the three components: as part of a hierarchy, they are worthy owing to the relation that connects them to worthier beings by whom they are appreciated and valued, beings who have attached them to their persons. 
77	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	it is in this way that they are distinguished; the quality of distinction does not presuppose here, as it does in the world of fame, a competition of all against all in a marketplace of esteem, but rather the exclusive judgment of a superior or leader and the elective choice that makes someone stand out from the ranks. 
78	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	beings are also worthy because they are rooted in tradition, that is, they are proper (as opposed, for example, to legal in the civic world or to exact in industrial arrangements). 
79	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	they exist in continuity (a property of the unworthy in the inspired world), and they possess all the qualities that manifest permanence, such as firmness, loyalty, punctuality. 
80	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	these virtues are manifested in behavior that varies depending, on the one hand, on whether the relationship with intimates or with outsiders is emphasized and, on the other hand, whether the relationship with superiors or with inferiors is emphasized. 
81	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	"attentive to intimates (for example, a spouse), to whom one owes thoughtfulness, attention, and propriety, the worthy person is cordial with visitors: the reputation of households is often made by visitors; thus one always benefits from being very cordial toward them, whether they are important or not"". """
82	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	"when they face superiors, beings worthy of esteem are deferential, which does not however imply obsequiousness, opportunism, or flattery"". """
83	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	"in this context, they are honest, presenting their viewpoint with frankness"" but without offering ""systematic opposition,"" and they maintain relations of trust. """
84	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	"this attitude will tend to create a climate of understanding"" based on discretion and reserve: ""the best way to appear well brought up"". """
85	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	"nevertheless, less worthy persons avoid familiarity with their hierarchical superior, even if they know him personally, especially in front of third parties. """
86	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	trust in others, superiors are informed and wise. 
87	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	"in the domestic world, where worth presupposes personal loyalty to a worthy being and membership in the closed universe of a household, objects are all the more private in character (letters, for example) to the extent that they are associated with the more worthy beings, and discretion consists in refusing to listen to gossip and especially in refusing to pass it along"". """

95	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	"upbringing, which produces the well-brought-up person"" in whom reserve is combined with poise, is in the end precisely what associates the worthy state with generation, a relation that is established here (as is often the case when an utterance reveals what lies at the heart of the natural order) in the mode of what we shall designate further on by the term ""desecration"": ""those who hold or who believe they hold the secrets of a good upbringing claim that it takes at least three generations to produce a wellbrought-up man"".

101	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	"the term natural\' (""drive nature out the window and it comes right back in the door"") also designates, finally, the character that is revealed in one\'s behavior toward other people and ""reflected"" in one\'s personal presentation and bearing. """
102	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	"in this world, bearing is inherent in persons because it manifests character, which is habit made human (personal bearing reflects the individual""). """
103	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	in a domestic world, beings are immediately qualified by their relationships with others. 
104	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	when beings belong to the same household, the relationship is one of order. 
105	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	    the terms thus refer to the beings that encompass them or to those that they themselves encompass, that is, those (superiors) from whom they delve their origin or those (inferiors) to whom they themselves have given rise. 
106	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	when the principle of subordination is engenderment and when the relation to others is established by means of reproduction, the more worthy beings precede and the less worthy follow in the generational chain: thus forebears and ancestors- grandfather and grandmother, father-in-law and mother-in-law, uncles and aunts, parents- are more worthy; children, or girls, are less worthy. 
107	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	but the principle of engenderment is not irrupted to procreation, and within a given household the more worthy beings are the primary causes of the less worthy ones, apart from blood ties: thus the husband (more _worthy) makes a woman his wife (less worthy) by marriage; the master or the mistress of the household contains, and is, the beings included therein: unmarried persons, children, servants, household pets. 
108	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	in a domestic world, in which beings can be qualified according to an extensive range of different states of worthiness, the less worthy are always present and designated as such because they are the very substance with which the worth of the more worthy that include them is constructed. 
109	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	thus persons who possess dignity in subordination, however unworthy they may be, are only truly deficient when they find themselves detached from the units that included them, either by distancing (foreigner, outsider) or owing to their own selfishness. 
110	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	the father is principle of cohesion in the family, the one who establishes the link to an origin; like the boss, or, earlier, the king, the father is the one who lifts beings up by means of the dependence in which he holds them and who thus gives them access to all the worth they are capable of achieving according to the level they occupy. 
111	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	since beings are always defined by a relation of subordination. 
112	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	similarly, less worthy beings are equivalent and no particular feature of childhood distinguishes small children from the other subordinate beings (unmarried persons, servants, and so on) for whom the more worthy beings are responsible. 
113	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	finally, when beings are not directly qualified by belonging to a hierarchical unit (household, guild, and so on), the relation that defines them does not specify their worth, which depends on that of a person with whom they have a relationship: a friend, a confidant, an intimate, a guest, an acquaintance, and so on, may be more or less worthy according to the worth of the other term, and association with a worthy person, which raises one\'s status, is opposed to undesirable associations, which lower it. 
114	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	in the domestic world, objects are primarily determined by the way they support and maintain hierarchical relationships among persons. 
115	domestic	1	Manually_gathered	"thus small gifts nourish friendship"" and foster bonding because they call for something in return: ""thanks are owed for everything received: flowers, gifts, candy, books, and so on,"" and- ""a sacrosanct principle--every letter requires a reply"". """

434	civic	1	Manually_gathered	justifications based on civic equality or solidarity refer to the collective welfare as the standard of evaluation, and propose or oppose projects based on such goals as equal access and protection of civil rights. 
435	civic	1	Manually_gathered	various forms of these civic justifications are found in both cases, and equality or solidarity is often the guiding logic underlying the modes of engagement or organization. 
436	civic	1	Manually_gathered	there are comparative differences also, relating generally to the fact that in the united states the emphasis is more on equal rights, while in france the emphasis is on solidarity against inequality (but not as much on civil rights). 
437	civic	1	Manually_gathered	this attempt to generalize the cause is couched in civic language of solidarity between struggles during meetings where spokespersons provide testimonies of comparable experiences. 
438	civic	1	Manually_gathered	the opposition to the somport project also organized many demonstrations and used the high level of participation in their demonstrations and their unitary slogans as proof for their arguments against the project. 
439	civic	1	Manually_gathered	the local grassroots opposition coalition in tuolumne county often emphasizes their representation of a diverse array of local people (not just the rafting interests or the environmentalists), and the silent solidarity of many more uninvolved but concerned local citizens. 
440	civic	1	Manually_gathered	the proponents of the dam, however, also lay claim to this silent support of the locals. 
441	civic	1	Manually_gathered	both sides at different times collected thousands of names on petitions and submitted them to either the local board of supervisors or the national ferc officials. 
442	civic	1	Manually_gathered	whereas in france, the civic reference to the general interest or solidarity is not indexed on the number of supporters or some measure of public opinion (see the next chapter for further exploration of this also). 
443	civic	1	Manually_gathered	the debate over the clavey in the turlock area, the valley agricultural region where the power from the dam would be used, provides additional insight into how solidarity is conceived in terms of opinion in the united states. for example, the opposition groups compiled lists of groups opposed to tid and tried to make the list as diverse and as public as possible. 
444	civic	1	Manually_gathered	this name shows the connection often made in the united states between civic equality concerns and market concerns, which were seen as more effective and generally resonant than strictly environmental arguments (or environmental-sounding group names). 
445	civic	1	Manually_gathered	in contrast, it is more common in france for equality and solidarity justifications to be connected with justifications concerning infrastructure planning and technical efficiency. 
446	civic	1	Manually_gathered	projects like the somport tunnel are often defended by their developers as meeting the needs of citizens (collectively and equally) through the most competent technical planning. 
447	civic	1	Manually_gathered	in fact, the civil servants of the ministry of public works, charged with planning and building infrastructure projects, denounced local opponents of the somport project as trying to protect their own piece of land and remaining stuck in the past, while resisting progress and denying the benefits of the project to all others. 
448	civic	1	Manually_gathered	probably no work presents a better account of what a civic world, at least in its french version, must be, than rousseau's contrat social. 
449	civic	1	Manually_gathered	in the civic polity, as in the domestic polity according to bossuet, civil peace depends on the authority of a sovereign whose position, above the selfish lusts of individuals, secures the common good. 
450	civic	1	Manually_gathered	but rousseau's sovereign is disembodied. 
451	civic	1	Manually_gathered	in the civic world, a sovereign is formed by the convergence of human wills, as citizens give up their particular interests and direct themselves exclusively towards the common good. 
452	civic	1	Manually_gathered	this civic worth counteracts the personal dependencies on which domestic worth is based, as well as the opinions of others which constitute the worth of renown. 
453	civic	1	Manually_gathered	in the civic world, persons are small if seen as particulars, following the dictates of a selfish will, and, in contrast, relevant and worthy if seen as members of the disembodied sovereign, exclusively concerned with the general interest. 
454	civic	1	Manually_gathered	the way the labor force is organized in the field of work is regulated by social laws which are themselves the outcome of the nineteenth-century effort to implement a civic principle of equivalence. 
455	civic	1	Manually_gathered	the peculiarity of the civic world is to lay stress on beings who are not individual beings but collective ones.

880	project	1	Manually_gathered	the projective city 
881	project	1	Manually_gathered	this city is founded on the mediating activity employed in the creation of networks, making it valuable in its own right, independently of the goals pursued or the substantive properties of the entities between which the mediation is conducted. 
882	project	1	Manually_gathered	from this standpoint, mediation is a value in itself, or rather, in the conceptual framework employed here, a specific status of which each actor is liable to take advantage when \'putting people in contact\', \'making connections\', thereby helping to \'construct networks\'. 
883	project	1	Manually_gathered	entertaining the hypothesis that we are witnessing the formation of a new city, where the tests that matter involve constructing or loosening connections in a network world, obviously does not mean that the establishment of networks represents a radical new departure. 
884	project	1	Manually_gathered	but it is as if we had to wait until the last third of the twentieth century for the activity of mediating, the art of making and using the most diverse and remote kinds of connection, to be autonomized - separated from the other forms of activity it had hitherto been bound up with - and identified and valued for itself. 
885	project	1	Manually_gathered	principle of judgement and hierarchy of beings in the projective city according to the grammar employed by us, the <common superior principle> is the principle in accordance with which acts, things and persons are judged in a given city. 
886	project	1	Manually_gathered	the <decline of the city>, like the <condition of little person>, refers to situations where behavior is deemed unsatisfactory by the city\'s values. 
887	project	1	Manually_gathered	if the <condition of little person> in the new city applies to bad (individual) behaviour in a world of projects, the <decline of the city> involves unsatisfactory rhizomorphous forms, \'bad networks\'. 
888	project	1	Manually_gathered	activity, projects, extension of the network, proliferation of connections <common superior principle> 
889	project	1	Manually_gathered	in a projective city, the general equivalent - what the status of persons and things is measured by - is activity. 
890	project	1	Manually_gathered	but in contrast to what we observe in the industrial city, where activity merges with work and the active are quintessentially those who have stable, productive waged work, activity in the projective city surmounts the oppositions between work and non-work, the stable and the unstable, wage-earning class and non-wage-earning class, paid work and voluntary work, that which may be assessed in terms of productivity and that which, not being measurable, eludes calculable assessment. 
891	project	1	Manually_gathered	\'[simultaneous] development of all the categories in the portfolio\' is therefore indicated: \'thanks to the multiplicity of clients, work for fees offers a certain guarantee of activity. 
892	project	1	Manually_gathered	self-educational work helps improve the chances of remaining active and voluntary work makes it possible to construct social networks outside work, to participate actively in progress towards a better world and to transmit wisdom to others\' (aubrey, 1994). 
893	project	1	Manually_gathered	activity aims to generate projects, or to achieve integration into projects initiated by others. 
894	project	1	Manually_gathered	but the project does not exist outside of the encounter (not being integrated once and for all into an institution or environment, it presents itself as an action to be performed, not as something that is already there). 
895	project	1	Manually_gathered	hence the activity par excellence is integrating oneself into networks and exploring them, so as to put an end to isolation, and have opportunities for meeting people or associating with things proximity to which is liable to generate a project. 
896	project	1	Manually_gathered	activity expresses itself in the multiplicity of projects of all kinds that may be pursued concurrently and which, no what matter what happens, must be elaborated successively, since the project represents a transient mechanism in this logic. 
897	project	1	Manually_gathered	life is conceived as a succession of projects; and the more they differ from one another, the more valuable they are. 
898	project	1	Manually_gathered	characterization of these projects according to categories that are apposite in other cities (whether familial, affective, educative, artistic, religious, charitable, etc. 
899	project	1	Manually_gathered	and above all their classification according to the distinction between that which pertains to leisure and that which relates to work, is not what matters in this city\'s logic, except in a very subsidiary fashion. 
900	project	1	Manually_gathered	what matters is to develop activity that is to say, never to be short of a project, bereft of an idea, always to have something in mind, in the pipeline, with other people whom one meets out of a desire to do something. 
901	project	1	Manually_gathered	when they engage in a project, everyone concerned knows that the undertaking to which they are about to contribute is destined to last not a limited period of time - that it not only can, but must, come to an end. 
902	project	1	Manually_gathered	the prospect of an inevitable, desirable endpoint thus accompanies engagement without affecting enthusiasm. 
903	project	1	Manually_gathered	this is why engagement is conceived as voluntary. 
904	project	1	Manually_gathered	having the option not to engage in a given project, and hence choice over one\'s projects, is a condition for the city\'s harmonious functioning; and this condition is guaranteed by the multiple activities everyone develops. 
905	project	1	Manually_gathered	furthermore, awareness that the project will come to an end is accompanied by the hope that a new project will follow, that it is already in gestation in the fabric of current connections, even if it is not yet known what form it will take. 
906	project	1	Manually_gathered	accordingly, tension between the requisite commitment and the indicated outcome appears surmountable. 
907	project	1	Manually_gathered	anything can attain the status of a project, including ventures hostile to capitalism. 
908	project	1	Manually_gathered	describing every accomplishment with a nominal grammar that is the grammar of the project erases the differences between a capitalist project and a humdrum creation (a sunday club). 
909	project	1	Manually_gathered	utterly different things can be assimilated to the term \'project\': opening a new factory, closing one, carrying out art-engineering project, putting on a play. each of them is a project, and they all involve the same heroism. 
910	project	1	Manually_gathered	this is one of the ways in which the projective city can win over forces hostile to capitalism: by proposing a grammar that transcends it, which they in turn will use to describe their own activity while remaining oblivious of the fact that capitalism, too, can slip into it. 
911	project	1	Manually_gathered	it is precisely because the project is a transient form that it is adjusted to a network world: by multiplying connections and proliferating links, the succession of projects has the effect of extending networks. 
912	project	1	Manually_gathered	the extension of the network is life itself, whereas any halt to its extension is comparable to death: \'the network spontaneously tends to develop, but it is constantly threatened by the risks of internal ossification or degeneration that can result in death, which might consist in its transformation into a pyramidal organization\' (landier, 1991). 
913	project	1	Manually_gathered	those without a project who no longer explore networks are threatened with exclusion - that is to say, in effect, with death in a reticular universe. 
914	project	1	Manually_gathered	they risk not finding a way to attach themselves to projects, and ceasing to exist. 
915	project	1	Manually_gathered	the development if oneself and one\'s employability (\'being the agent of one\'s own evolution, taking control of one\'s future\' [le saget, 1994]), which is the long-term personal project underlying all the others, will not be successfully accomplished. 
916	project	1	Manually_gathered	 connection <natural relations between beings> connecting, communicating, co-ordinating, adjusting to others, trusting in a connexionist world, a natural preoccupation of human beings is the desire to connect with others, to make contact, to make connections, so as not to remain isolated. 
917	project	1	Manually_gathered	to succeed, they must trust and be trusted, know how to communicate discuss openly, and also be capable of adjusting to other people and situations\' depending on what the latter demand of them, without being held back; timidity, rigidity or mistrust. 
918	project	1	Manually_gathered	this is the price of co-ordinating themselves in mechanisms and projects. 
919	project	1	Manually_gathered	engaging, mobile <condition of great man> enthusiastic, involved, flexible, adaptable, versatile, having potential, employable, autonomous, not prescriptive, knows how to engage others, in touch, tolerant, employability (providing) knowing how to engage in a project, to get fully involved in, it, is the mark of the <condition of great man>. 
920	project	1	Manually_gathered	to engage, one must be capable of enthusiasm. 
921	project	1	Manually_gathered	furthermore, given that the project is a complex, uncertain process, which cannot be confined within the limits of invariably incomplete contracts, one must know how to trust those with whom connections are formed     connections that are destined to develop as the project develops. 
922	project	1	Manually_gathered	but since projects are by their very nature temporary, the ability to disengage from a project in order to be available for new connections counts as much as the capacity for engagement, even at the peak of engagement, enthusiasm, involvement in a project, people at ease in a network world remain \'adaptable, physically and intellectually mobile! 
923	project	1	Manually_gathered	prepared for change and capable of new investments, in order to increase their \'ability to respond to a changing world\' (crozier and serieyx, 1994). 
924	project	1	Manually_gathered	far from being attached to an occupation or clinging to a qualification, the great man proves adaptable and flexible, able to switch from one situation to a very different one, and adjust to it; and versatile, capable of changing activity or tools, depending on the nature of the relationship entered into with others or with objects, it is precisely this adaptability and versatility that make him employable - that is to say, in the world of firms, in a position to attach himself to new projects. 
925	project	1	Manually_gathered	flexibility and adaptability here are qualities that do not derive from obedience. 
926	project	1	Manually_gathered	the great man in a connexionist world is active and autonomous. 
927	project	1	Manually_gathered	he is \'his own leader, leader in his relations with those above and those below, leader in his networks\' (serieyx, 1993). 
928	project	1	Manually_gathered	the great man in the projective city retains the initiative in his projects, and knows how to take nsks in order to make connections, to be forever making new contacts that are full of possibilities: \'thus, the idea of a link seems to pros rather like a vein or seam to exploit, in tile manner of a gold prospecter, you never quite know what is at the end of it. 
929	project	1	Manually_gathered	it is sometimes necessary to turn round and go back, give up en route, go and look elsewhere\' (bellenger, 1992). 
930	project	1	Manually_gathered	always on the lookout, great men refuse to be impeded by rigid plans, for to follow such plans could result in squandering the opportunity for interesting connections. 
931	project	1	Manually_gathered	plans and strategies would diminish their capacity for local action. 
932	project	1	Manually_gathered	but they know how to take full advantage of each situation in its uniqueness. for the same reasons they appear spontaneous, in contrast to strategists, whose manoeuvres are overly conspicuous, and frighten people. 
933	project	1	Manually_gathered	they know how to locate sources of information (\'being a radar\' [bellenger, 1992]), and to select between connections with a lot of new potential and those that revert to routine existing links. 
934	project	1	Manually_gathered	they are capable of optimizing the use they make of their scarcest resource - time - by selecting their relationships with discrimination and, in particular, by avoiding linking up with people who occupy kindred positions, and are thus likely to contribute superfluous information and connections: \'given that one can\'t do everything, what should one concentrate on? 
935	project	1	Manually_gathered	in this city, the great man is a \'plunderer of ideas\' (serieyx, 1993). 
936	project	1	Manually_gathered	for that, he must possess intuition and talent (in the sense in which we speak of an artist\'s talent). he \'scans the world around him in search of novel signs\' (sicard, 1994), and knows how to anticipate, sense, sniff out the links worth pursuing. 
937	project	1	Manually_gathered	this is to say that in a network world there is a close correlation between the importance of social capital and of information capital. 
938	project	1	Manually_gathered	information is at once the result and the condition of multiplying connections, so that inequalities of information are cumulative. 
939	project	1	Manually_gathered	to succeed in discovering good connections, such information must be integrated into a representation of the universe to be explored. 
940	project	1	Manually_gathered	in a network world, however, there can be no question of an overarching representation. 
941	project	1	Manually_gathered	useful representations are local, singular, circumstantial, able to be deployed from one person to the next, and bound up with a kind of knowledge deriving from personal experience. 
942	project	1	Manually_gathered	but those of high status in the projective city do not merely identify connections. 
943	project	1	Manually_gathered	they must also show themselves capable of becoming established in them, by forging links that last as long as is necessary. 
944	project	1	Manually_gathered	given that links presuppose the engagement of at least two people, they must avoid being rejected; on the contrary, they must attract the attention and sympathy of others - interest them. 
945	project	1	Manually_gathered	to this end they must not be timid, or - which boils down to the same thing - so proud as not to take the first step for fear of rejection. 
946	project	1	Manually_gathered	they write to people in the public eye to express their admiration and request advice or a meeting. 
947	project	1	Manually_gathered	they regard everyone as contact able and any contact as possible and natural; they treat well-known and obscure people in identical fashion. 
948	project	1	Manually_gathered	they tend to ignore the differences between separate spheres. 
949	project	1	Manually_gathered	for them the world is a network of potential connections. 
950	project	1	Manually_gathered	in respect of links, it\'s all one. 
951	project	1	Manually_gathered	the great man in the projective city is not a nowhere man. 
952	project	1	Manually_gathered	at ease where he finds himself, he also knows how to be local. 
953	project	1	Manually_gathered	in fact, since the network has no overarching representation, actions in it are always embedded in the contingency of a present situation. 
954	project	1	Manually_gathered	to adapt to the situations that crop up, while preserving something unfamiliar that makes him interesting, connexionist man relies on his communication skills, his convivial temperament, his open and inquiring mind. 
955	project	1	Manually_gathered	but he knows also how to give of himself, to be there as and when appropriate, to exploit his presence in personal relations, in face-to-face encounters: he is always available, even-tempered, self-assured without being arrogant, familiar without overstepping the limits, obliging, with more to offer than he expects in return. 
956	project	1	Manually_gathered	without his demanding information or going in search of it, others give him the information he needs. 
957	project	1	Manually_gathered	he knows how to listen, to give answers that are to the point, to echo people, to ask good questions. 
958	project	1	Manually_gathered	as bellenger (1992) develops the point, he possesses \'a strategy for conducting relationships, a kind of self-monitoring that results in an aptitude for producing signs which can facilitate contacts\'. 
959	project	1	Manually_gathered	"he knows how to \'be attentive to others in order to identify signs that will make it possible to intervene advisedly in uncertain situations\'; he possesses \'the ability to control and alter self-presentation, which can extend to a capacity for improvizing appropriately, even for lying without qualms"" if necessary\', as well as the \'desire and ability to adjust his own actions with ease, in order to adapt to different people\'. """
960	project	1	Manually_gathered	great men, past masters when it comes to self-monitoring, know how to judge \'other people\'s emotional states more lucidly and are perceived in their turn as more friendly, open, less uneasy, less anxious, less nervous in their relationships\'. 
961	project	1	Manually_gathered	[an] adroitness in the way they conduct themselves in the world, in making connections, in acting in such a way as to get what they want\' (bellenger, 1992). 
962	project	1	Manually_gathered	they also possess \'charm\', in the sense that they depart from the stereotyped image one might have had of them before getting to know them. 
963	project	1	Manually_gathered	they make it clear (without this being attributable to strategy or calculation) that they are not reducible to the statutory properties defining them in their curriculum vitae. 
964	project	1	Manually_gathered	face to face, they are real people, in the sense that, far from mechanically performing their social roles -\' in the way a programme is executed - they know how to step back and deviate from their role, which makes them captivating. 
965	project	1	Manually_gathered	but these qualities do not suffice to define the condition of great man, because they can be employed in opportunistic fashion, as part of a purely individual strategy for success. 
966	project	1	Manually_gathered	in the logic of the city, the great are not only those who excel at exploiting the specific resources connected with a world, but also those who place the capacities disclosed in tests at the service of the common good. 
967	project	1	Manually_gathered	that is to say: in the projective city they are not only those who know how to engage, but also those who are able to engage others, to offer involvement, to make it desirable to follow them, because they inspire trust, they are charismatic, their vision generates enthusiasm. 
968	project	1	Manually_gathered	all these qualities make them leaders of teams that they manage not in authoritarian fashion, but by listening to others, with tolerance, recognizing and respecting differences. 
969	project	1	Manually_gathered	they are not (hierarchical) bosses, but integrators, facilitators, an inspiration, unifiers of energies, enhancers of life, meaning and autonomy. 
970	project	1	Manually_gathered	the team trusts them inasmuch as they prove to be connectors, vectors, who do not keep the information or contacts gleaned in networks to themselves, but redistribute them among the team members. 
971	project	1	Manually_gathered	\'tomorrow\'s manager must ensure that information is shared, that it irrigates the firm thoroughly\' (le saget, 1994). 
972	project	1	Manually_gathered	in such a context, everyone can \'constantly and increasingly improve their employability, both through these technical skills and their ability for teamwork, even and especially when these teams are flexible, neural, and rarely made up of the same individuals. 
973	project	1	Manually_gathered	the project head thus provides employability, and develops for others \'in the firm a network of personal relations that they can count on in the event of unforeseen problems\' (landier, 1991). 
974	project	1	Manually_gathered	in this way, \'employability [can be guaranteed]- that is to say, a level of skills and flexibility allowing each individual to find a new job inside or outside the firm\' (aubrey, 1993); employability is thus \'a gift in return from the firm to individuals who are aware of their responsibilities in it\' (aubrey, 1994). 
975	project	1	Manually_gathered	mediator, project head <repertoire of subjects> coach, expert, customer, supplier, innovator 
976	project	1	Manually_gathered	if everyone possesses the capacity to relate, and thus to constitute a link in a network, some people realize this potential in their person in exemplary fashion. 
977	project	1	Manually_gathered	in very general terms, this is true of all those who, playing an active role in the expansion and animation of networks, act as mediators, whether characterized as strategic brokers able to \'make strategic exchanges outside of hierarchy and boundaries\' (aubrey, 1994), as partners of the third kind (archier et al, 1989), or as tangential contributors. 
978	project	1	Manually_gathered	they possess the art of reconciling opposites, and know how to bring very different people together, and put them in contact. 
979	project	1	Manually_gathered	such are, in the first instance, project heads, \'managers\' (in contrast to the old cadres), but also coaches, who stimulate, support the development of managers and practise \'the art of delivering minds\' (aubrey, 1990). 
980	project	1	Manually_gathered	but such equally are customers, suppliers and subcontractors when they enter into relations of partnership. 
981	project	1	Manually_gathered	these innovators have scientists, and especially artists, as their models. 
982	project	1	Manually_gathered	\'the informal network is the preferred organizational mode of writers, scientific researchers and musicians, who develop in domains where knowledge is highly specialized, creative and personalized\' (aubrey, 1990). 
983	project	1	Manually_gathered	the intuitive manager, like the artist, \'is accompanied by disorder\' (le saget, 1992), is \'in a permanent state of alert and doubt\' (vincent, 1990) and \'at ease in     situations\' (archier et al, 1989). 
984	project	1	Manually_gathered	but the intuitive manager, the source of inspiration and the coach are not the only models of excellence. 
985	project	1	Manually_gathered	experts also enjoy high status in the projective city because their competence, which is indispensable, is composed not of standardized knowledge but of personal, integrated knowledge. 
986	project	1	Manually_gathered	it is the fruit of past experience - that is to say, of multiple connections, particularly with others possessing specific knowledge, formed during earlier projects, of which they preserve the memory. 
987	project	1	Manually_gathered	dispensing with experts would require being in a position to repeat their careers. 
988	project	1	Manually_gathered	experts are consulted. 
989	project	1	Manually_gathered	but their image is less heroic than that of the project head, because they are deemed less adaptable. 
990	project	1	Manually_gathered	the project head is precisely the one who proves capable of making connections between very different zones of expertise. 
991	project	1	Manually_gathered	what all these exceptional beings have in common is that they are in a position to explore the links with the richest opportunities, those that will extend the network furthest, which are defined largely by the distance they surmount. 
992	project	1	Manually_gathered	not all links are of equivalent worth. 
993	project	1	Manually_gathered	the status of a connection depends upon the extent to which it has established a mediation that makes it possible to abolish distance. 
994	project	1	Manually_gathered	in so doing, creators of links temporarily find themselves in the position of keyholder, since all those who in turn want to cross the boundaries they have traversed will, for a certain period of time, have to go through them. 
995	project	1	Manually_gathered	the most interesting links often consist, in fact, in crossing zones where there were few, if any, mediations (structural holes, in the terminology of ronald burt). 
996	project	1	Manually_gathered	it can be referred to in temporal terms, when old, dormant connections are reactivated.

998	project	1	Manually_gathered	1g and above all, it can be evoked in institutional or social terms, when the beings between whom some transfer is established, and who are proximate in space and time, were hitherto separated by boundaries isolating institutions, disciplines, domains, or (in pierre bourdieu\'s terminology) fields from one another. 
999	project	1	Manually_gathered	the forms in which a distance is overcome define different ways of possessing high status. 
1000	project	1	Manually_gathered	thus, whereas the expert is above all rich in links of the first (temporal) or second (spatial) types, the project head or source of inspiration excels in establishing connections between domains or fields: he establishes collaboration between people from different disciplines or professions, belonging to various departments, institutions or firms, and brings together, for example, two experts each of whom has experience, but in different domains. 
1001	project	1	Manually_gathered	in a network world, where the more unpredictable and remote connections are, the more likely they are to prove profitable, the class habitus, on which the spontaneous convergence of tastes relies in predominantly domestic social orders, is no longer a sufficient support for intuition or flair on the contrary, the great man is he who establishes links between beings who are not only removed from one another, located in different universes, but also distant from his social background and the circle of his immediate relations, this is why, unlike the old bourgeois society, a capitalism that incorporates connexionist justifications accepts those who, thanks to a rather erratic career path (at least in their youth), have a fund of experience and are acquainted with several worlds, endowing them with considerable adaptability. 
1002	project	1	Manually_gathered	the verdict delivered on the quality of a link does not take into account only the distance that it has made it possible to bridge - that is to say, its ex-ante probability (less likely links being more prized than very likely ones). 
1003	project	1	Manually_gathered	it also takes account of the degree to which the link, once established, has proved fruitful ex-post, in the sense that its result is to refocus and extend the network by prompting the emergence of new links. 
1004	project	1	Manually_gathered	in this way, we can distinguish between (a) links that are highly probable but largely unproductive, such as those established between the members of a clique, where the connections are compact and within everyone\'s reach, but define a self-enclosed set; (b) very probable but nevertheless productive links, in the sense that they open on to the outside world, such as the links that popularizers or journalists make; (c) links that are very unlikely but also very unproductive, such as those established by the misunderstood forerunner or, worse, the crank or madman who, finding no one to follow him, cannot operate as a key holder; and finally (d) links that are simultaneously unlikely and highly productive, which create the status of the innovator or audacious project head.

1006	project	1	Manually_gathered	the same may be said of the mechanisms, primarily entrepreneurial mechanisms here (subcontracting, flexible organization, out-sourcing, autonomous units, franchises), which characterize the postmodern, \'re-engineered\', network, firm. 
1007	project	1	Manually_gathered	the descriptive terminology of the connexionist world is pulled in two different directions: either towards a thematic of action without a subject, where the only entity that counts is the network, where what occurs is of the anonymous order of the id, of selforganization (,the organization increases its capacity for self-organization\'); or towards a neopersonalism, which emphasizes not the system, but human beings in search of meaning. 
1008	project	1	Manually_gathered	given that what matters most is intangible, impalpable, informal- a term that characterizes both relations and the rules of the game, which are invented as one goes along - the most appropriate

1010	project	1	Manually_gathered	this last register is employed in particular to emphasize the autonomy and even the volition of the network, which is stronger than that of the beings immersed in it, and whose properties are then described in the language of selforganization, self regulation, and spontaneous morphogenesis. 
1011	project	1	Manually_gathered	finally, the project is indeed the central mechanism of the city that bears its name. 
1012	project	1	Manually_gathered	it \'has at its disposal unity of time, but not unity of place. it must optimize internal resources, compare them with external resources, and make the best use of experts organized in network structures\' (hec, 1994).

1014	project	1	Manually_gathered	different grounds for non-engagement identify different types of little person. 
1015	project	1	Manually_gathered	given that trust and relational qualities are the cement of projects, the unemployable ones are those who do not know how to inspire trust, or cannot be trusted because they do not deliver what is expected of them, or do not circulate the information they possess and are \'out for themselves\' - which is a form of dishonesty in their engagement (opportunism). 
1016	project	1	Manually_gathered	the basic rule is \'reciprocity: the best-intentioned are discouraged if they receive nothing in exchange for what they have given. anyone who retains information that could be useful to others to himself is a killer of networks\' (orgogozo, 1991). 
1017	project	1	Manually_gathered	"likewise inferior are those who do not know how to communicate, because they are impervious or have fixed ideas, are authoritarian and intolerant, making them incapable if compromise. they resemble all \'the office miseries"", the sullen types, the individualists who withdraw into themselves, never go out, don\'t participate in the end-of-year drinks, shun cocktails, return to the hotel pronto, and plant themselves in front of the tele, that absolute ""network-killer\'"" (bellenger, 1992).

1018	project	1	Manually_gathered	rigidity, which, as the converse of flexibility, in this world constitutes the main failing of little people, can have different origins. 
1019	project	1	Manually_gathered	it can derive from attachment to a single project that it is impossible to let go of when a new project comes along; or from attachment to a place which, by rendering them immobile and rooting them in what is local, confines little people to the existing circle of links, and prevents them making new connections. 
1020	project	1	Manually_gathered	finally, its origin can be found in a preference for security even at the expense of autonomy. 
1021	project	1	Manually_gathered	thus, in a projective city someone who has a status is not mobile. 
1022	project	1	Manually_gathered	someone who has a status knows what to expect from life: what their duties are (what is expected of them) and what their rights are (what they can expect of others). 
1023	project	1	Manually_gathered	if the disadvantages attaching to a status stem principally from the limits it imposes on people\'s activities, in the logic of the projective city statutory advantages are suspected of concealing injustices.

1025	project	1	Manually_gathered	closure of the network <decline of the city> corruption, privileges, buddy-buddy relationships, mafia 
1026	project	1	Manually_gathered	the city falls when the network is no longer extended and, closing in on itself, benefits some people, but no longer serves the public good. 
1027	project	1	Manually_gathered	this is the case when the networker keeps information to himself, weaves connections in secret, unbeknownst to his team, in order not to share the links he has established and retain the benefits for himself, avoiding a situation where others can pursue them without going through him (\'the most important adaptive function of a network consists in absorbing and redistributing information\' [landier, 1991]). 
1028	project	1	Manually_gathered	this is the case with large bodies: \'for large bodies are today anti-networks inasmuch as they exercise authority over their members in order to further their own objectives\' (bellenger, 1992). 
1029	project	1	Manually_gathered	closed networks that call a halt to their own extension, and which are appropriated for the exclusive benefit of \'those who are in on them\', are also dangerous: \'it would be a mistake to think that every network automatically favours enterprise and development, as is clearly indicated by the dramatic events marking italy\'s attempts to restructure an economy engulfed by networks of corruption.

1031	project	1	Manually_gathered	forms of justice in the projective city 
1032	project	1	Manually_gathered	the elements of grammar we have just laid out clarify the principle of equivalence on which the projective city is based, and the way it can be employed to characterize persons and things, and to define the conditions of great man or little person. 
1033	project	1	Manually_gathered	but we also know that in order to be robust in the face of critiques based on a sense of what is just, this specific order must be geared towards the common good, and submit to a certain number of constraints. 
1034	project	1	Manually_gathered	we have already seen that great men are not only versatile, engaged and mobile themselves, but that they cause others to benefit from these qualities by striving to advance their employability at the same time as they develop their own. 
1035	project	1	Manually_gathered	they do not keep what they garner via their connections for themselves, with the result that the good network remains open and expands continuously, to the maximum benefit of all. 
1036	project	1	Manually_gathered	 redistribution of connections <status relation> putting in contact, redistributing information, integrating into networks, providing employability 
1037	project	1	Manually_gathered	the relation between great man and little people is just when, in exchange for the trust that the little people place in them and their zeal for engaging in projects, great men enhance the value of the more humble, in order to increase their employability - that is to say, their capacity, once one project is finished, to integrate themselves into another. 
1038	project	1	Manually_gathered	terminating a project without worrying about what becomes of those who have participated in it is unworthy of a great man. 
1039	project	1	Manually_gathered	"\'in place of the traditional contract, which guaranteed security, promotion and development, it is now appropriate to make an agreement that creates a sense of belonging, which helps the individual to maintain his employability"" or the value of his labour, and which exploits the various opportunities to learn while at work\' (aubrey, 1994). """
1040	project	1	Manually_gathered	to that end, great men must redistribute the scarce goods they have access to - in the first place, information (\'eliminating the restrictions that limit everyone\'s access to information\'[le saget, 1994]), and integration into networks, \'whose collective function is to support and enrich each member\'s assignment\' (aubrey, 1990). 
1041	project	1	Manually_gathered	we still have to clarify two elements that are crucial for the implementation of justice in a rhizomorphous world - what the grammar we are employing calls the <formula of investment> as well as the <model test>. 
1042	project	1	Manually_gathered	adaptability <formula of investment> being streamlined, flexibility, tolerance, renting\'  
1043	project	1	Manually_gathered	in a projective city, access to the condition of great man presupposes sacrificing anything that might impede availability - that is to say, the ability to engage in a new project. 
1044	project	1	Manually_gathered	the great man renounces having a single project that lasts a lifetime (a vocation, a profession, a marriage, etc. 
1045	project	1	Manually_gathered	he is mobile, nothing must hamper his movements. 
1046	project	1	Manually_gathered	he is a \'nomad\'. 
1047	project	1	Manually_gathered	in this sense, all the sacrifices that are made have the effect of enhancing the streamlined character of entities - of persons, but also of things - in order to favour their reorganization when the next project comes along. 
1048	project	1	Manually_gathered	thus, \'the leaner organization that contracts out for services depends on the suppliers of those services and therefore benefits from close co-operation with them\' (moss kanter, 1990). 
1049	project	1	Manually_gathered	the requirement to be streamlined first of all assumes renouncing stability, rootedness, attachment to the local, the security of longstanding links. 
1050	project	1	Manually_gathered	when it comes to links, to invest effort is to give up what one already has for an uncertain alternative: not to shut oneself away in pre-established links, so that one is available to tryout new connections that might fail. 
1051	project	1	Manually_gathered	in the knowledge that time is limited, it is in fact advisable to carve out the time to forge links with different persons and universes, rather than always remaining in the same circle of people: \'being a pro means revising one\'s accessibility in quasi strategic fashion, time can\'t just be invented and so it is a question of making choices and daring to take decisions, a pro\'s appointments are handled with extreme care\' (bellenger, 1992). 
1052	project	1	Manually_gathered	extension of the network thus demands that people renounce friendship or, rather, that when assessing the quality of a link they abandon the distinction between disinterested bonds of friendship and professional or useful relations: [a] network is always based on strong interpersonal relations, situated beyond work in the strict sense. 
1053	project	1	Manually_gathered	depending on the case, such trust can be, founded on situations that were experienced in common in the past, on belonging to the same institution, on the existence of a common objective or project, on relations of friendship or mutual respect, even on mere complicity derived from being connected to the same communications network. 
1054	project	1	Manually_gathered	thus, it can be said of \'social and family networks\' that \'this capital represents relations which, in addition to satisfaction on a human level, offer a potential contribution to the enterprise envisaged\' (aubrey, 1994). but while connections with members of the extended family, assimilated to a network, can prove profitable, the restricted family, like the group of \'old mates\' or the clique of \'office neighbours\', preserves the tie to old, superseded connections, and by that token represents a burden, a handicap. 
1055	project	1	Manually_gathered	great men in the projective city are also streamlined in that they are liberated from the burden of their own passions and values: open to differences (unlike rigid, absolutist personalities attached to the defence of universal values). 
1056	project	1	Manually_gathered	for the same reasons, they are not critical (except when it comes to defending tolerance and difference). 
1057	project	1	Manually_gathered	nothing must get the upper hand over the imperative of adjustment, or hamper their movements. 
1058	project	1	Manually_gathered	they are determined exclusively by factors deriving from the situation and connections they are caught up in, which completely define them. 
1059	project	1	Manually_gathered	the tolerance required to adjust to others can also be expressed in terms of emancipation from \'bourgeois morality\', the streamlined human being has learnt from psychoanalysis - and, more generally, from the diffusion of \'interpretation as exercise of suspicion\' - that one must know how to free oneself from moralism by casting suspicion on the hidden motives involved in moralizing ventures and acknowledging the validity of ambivalence. 
1060	project	1	Manually_gathered	the numerous tools of analytical provenance integrated into the projective city thus aim to develop realism: they serve to look reality in the face - including (or especially) the reality of desire, treated as one datum among others - but also, by the same token, to recognize the limits placed on desire by reality. 
1061	project	1	Manually_gathered	in a network world, it is thus realistic to be ambivalent (in contrast to the boss who is all of one piece in the hierarchical world), because the situations people have to confront are themselves complex and uncertain. 
1062	project	1	Manually_gathered	according to the same principle of eliminating anything that might hinder mobility, the streamlined human being must not be attached to a burdensome patrimony, and should prefer to ownership other formulas that provide access to the enjoyment of objects, such as renting. 
1063	project	1	Manually_gathered	in this instance, distance with respect to ownership does not derive from some ascetic contempt for material goods, which it is perfectly licit to have at one\'s disposal and to enjoy, but is simply the result of the need to streamline oneself so that one can move around easily. 
1064	project	1	Manually_gathered	for the same reasons, connexionist man likewise tends not to let himself be trapped by institutions, with all the various obligations that entails, and not to allow himself to become entangled in a web of responsibilities towards the other people or organizations he has responsibility for. 
1065	project	1	Manually_gathered	that is why he prefers to renounce official power in favour of network forms of power, freed of the constraints of supervision, invigilation, management, representation, and respect for the state rules regulating the use of goods and the management of human beings. 
1066	project	1	Manually_gathered	he leaves that to others, for he prefers autonomy to security. 
1067	project	1	Manually_gathered	great men in the projective city likewise renounce exercising any form of domination over others by taking advantage of statutory or hierarchical properties that would vouchsafe them ready recognition. 
1068	project	1	Manually_gathered	their authority depends exclusively on their competence. 
1069	project	1	Manually_gathered	they do not impose their rules or objectives, but agree to discuss their positions (principle of tolerance). 
1070	project	1	Manually_gathered	underlying these different forms of renunciation, we find a more basic sacrifice: that of personality, in the sense of a manner of being that expresses itself in similar attitudes and conduct whatever the circumstances. 
1071	project	1	Manually_gathered	"\'the image of the chameleon is a tempting one for describing the pro, who knows how to conduct his relationships in order to reach other people more easily \' adaptability is the key to the network spirit (efforts have to be made to take the first step), (bellenger, 1992). """
1072	project	1	Manually_gathered	streamlined people sacrifice a certain interiority and fidelity to the self, the better to adjust to the people with whom they come into contact and to the ever-changing situations in which they are obliged to act (this also assumes renunciation of the hubris of calculate on in favour of a limited rationality). 
1073	project	1	Manually_gathered	<model tests> are just as necessary for fulfilling the requirements of justice, and for their inscription in the fabric of everyday relations. 
1074	project	1	Manually_gathered	the end of a project and the beginning if another 
1075	project	1	Manually_gathered	<model test> people cannot be judged on the basis of a single project, because their status reveals itself in the model test and this, as we already know, is the transition from one project to the next. 
1076	project	1	Manually_gathered	it is when a project is finished that the key holders are revealed and an appraisal is conducted. 
1077	project	1	Manually_gathered	appraisal is positive in the case of those who, having enhanced their reputation in the course of the project they are leaving, succeed in integrating themselves into a new one. 
1078	project	1	Manually_gathered	contrariwise, it is negative when an inability to maintain or develop links and to liaise with others disqualifies the applicant. 
1079	project	1	Manually_gathered	in fact, links are a form of capital that does not belong to those who have the use of them. 
1080	project	1	Manually_gathered	by way of sanction, links can always be unilaterally withdrawn by those with whom they are made. 
1081	project	1	Manually_gathered	if the moment of the transition from one project to another constitutes the test par excellence, in the logic of a projective city the world is the more testing and hence also the more just - the shorter, the more numerous, and the more changeable projects are.

1084	project	1	Manually_gathered	those from whom nothing is to be expected are avoided, kept at a distance or, more simply, ignored. 
1085	project	1	Manually_gathered	one of the peculiarities of network forms is that, unlike what occurs in totalities defined by an inscription of spatial order in a territory (nations, districts, etc.), of temporal order in a history (lineage), or of legal order in an institution (administrations, churches, etc.), those who are depreciated lose all visibility and even, in a way, any existence. 
1086	project	1	Manually_gathered	for in the logic of this world, existence itself is a relational attribute: every entity, and human persons by the same token as the rest, exists to a greater or lesser extent depending upon the number and value of the connections that pass via it. 
1087	project	1	Manually_gathered	this is why such a world has no sanctions other than rejection or exclusion, which, in depriving someone of their links (,disaffiliation\', in robert castel\'s terminology), expels them to the margins of the network, where connections are at once both sparse and worthless. 
1088	project	1	Manually_gathered	the excluded person is someone who depends on others, but on whom no one any longer depends, who is not wanted by anyone, who is no longer sought after, no longer invited, who, even if his address book is full of names, has disappeared from other people\'s address books. 
1089	project	1	Manually_gathered	it follows that in such a world the mechanisms of justice are essentially preventive.

1092	project	1	Manually_gathered	the question of a city\'s anchorage in a definition of nature is a crucial one. 
1093	project	1	Manually_gathered	first of all, it is important on the level of justice that all human beings have the ability to achieve better conditions, and only a definition of human nature guarantees the sharing of this ability by the whole of humanity. 
1094	project	1	Manually_gathered	the <dignity of persons> refers to this dimension in each city; it is what makes for equality and points towards the natural human properties that give everyone the same opportunity to achieve greatness if they do what is required - in particular, if they make the indicated sacrifices (compare the <formula of investment. 
1095	project	1	Manually_gathered	the need to connect < dignity of persons> all the active operators in a network can accede to better conditions, because they all possess the ability to connect with others. 
1096	project	1	Manually_gathered	the desire to connect is a basic property of human nature. 
1097	project	1	Manually_gathered	in this anthropology, all women and all men are beings of contacts and relations: \'attachment is not the result of a libidinal or learning process . 
1098	project	1	Manually_gathered	it corresponds to a primary tendency - the need for others - which is stronger than hunger and earlier than sexuality\' (bellenger, 1992). 
1099	project	1	Manually_gathered	this need for connection, which is so universal, is the reason why everyone can integrate themselves into networks and acquire employability. 
1100	project	1	Manually_gathered	no one is excluded a priori. 
1101	project	1	Manually_gathered	functioning in networks also satisfies the highly human characteristic of wanting to be simultaeously free and engaged: \'[a]ll of us make commitments. 
1102	project	1	Manually_gathered	they may erode our freedom to act autonomously, but in return they provide some meaning in our lives and on the job. 
1103	project	1	Manually_gathered	\' our \'deep desire for autonomy and self-reliance [is] combined with an equally deep conviction that life has no meaning unless shared with others in the context of community\' (waterman, 1988). 
1104	project	1	Manually_gathered	without this radical duality that each of us bears within ourselves, the series of engagements and disengagements supposed by the projective city would seem absolutely inhuman. 
1105	project	1	Manually_gathered	in the case of the projective city, the <harmonious figure of natural order> is obviously the network, or rather, the networks that have always existed in the life of human beings.

1107	project	1	Manually_gathered	it imposes itself on entities, whether human or non-human, even if actors are not conscious of it: \'organization in networks is not something new; it has always existed, like the prose that monsieur jourdain composed unawares\' (landier, 1991). 
1108	project	1	Manually_gathered	all beings and all societies have their networks, and [w]e normally think of them as the informal pathways along which information and influences flow: feminists complain [about] an \'old boys\' network\'. 
1109	project	1	Manually_gathered	but the network form of organization was previously suspect in firms, and bore the stamp of the clandestine. 
1110	project	1	Manually_gathered	the moment for its rehabilitation has now arrived: in the traditional firm, it had an unofficial, even clandestine character, which was deemed subversive of the official hierarchical organization. 
1111	project	1	Manually_gathered	for workers, for example, it consisted in discovering tricks to reduce the unpleasantness of their task. 
1112	project	1	Manually_gathered	informal networks were thus directed against hierarchy; the objective was to defend oneself against decisions that were resented as irrational or unjust.

1455	inspired	1	Manually_gathered	a less obvious but often quite significant category of justifications involve judgments based on inspiration, passion, and emotion, and often point to the singularity or creativity of a person, object, or action which is the source of inspiration. 
1456	inspired	1	Manually_gathered	the proof for inspiration justifications is the display of an emotion, or otherwise showing that one is moved or overwhelmed or awed. 
1457	inspired	1	Manually_gathered	although these sorts of arguments often lead to the critique that they are unable to be discussed or challenged as general (more than personal) claims, and that they are irrational or unreasonable, we find that emotionally inspired (or inspiring) gestures and claims can be publicly displayed, commonly evaluated, and criticized within a specific order of worth. they can be the proof of some valuable attachment beyond mere personal feelings, of people making the step from personal passion to a kind of generalized argument where inspiration is valued as a common good.

1466	inspired	1	Manually_gathered	in this world, worth is viewed as an immediate relationship to an external source from which all possible worth flows. 
1467	inspired	1	Manually_gathered	this worth rests upon the attainment of a state of grace and is, therefore, completely independent of recognition by others.

1518	inspired	1	Manually_gathered	thus artists, who often embody inspired worth today, are worthy because they include the others in the singularity of a proper name: baudelaire, cocteau, einstein, galileo, mozart, shakespeare, and the like. 
1519	inspired	1	Manually_gathered	according to this logic, there are beings even worthier than artists, beings who inhabit magical worlds (shades, fairies, magi), but when these are evoked in the work we are drawing on here it is always in a desecratory mode.

2038	market	1	Manually_gathered	such problems surface in particular when time is introduced as a factor in market relations, which are atemporal by nature. 
2039	market	1	Manually_gathered	as for the market world, it is not animated exclusively by business relations between buyers and sellers. 
2040	market	1	Manually_gathered	this world is also peopled with omnipresent objects; the economist can overlook their role in the coordination of actions only when he treats them as endowed with a nature independent of the interventions of others.

2042	market	1	Manually_gathered	by bringing to light the quality of objects of a market nature and their role in coordination, we are preparing to deal with the complex situations in which ambiguous objects disturb this coordination: something scribbled by picasso on the corner of a table, a dented tank that does not meet industrial contemporary standards, a used car, and so on. 
2043	market	1	Manually_gathered	in this paragraph, we are pursuing the demonstration we undertook in our analysis of the market polity, by indicating how the market world can be related to the same model of worth, and what specifications are established in it for relevant beings and relationships. 
2044	market	1	Manually_gathered	in the market world, actions are motivated by the desires of individuals, which drive them to possess the same objects, rare goods whose ownership is inalienable. 
2045	market	1	Manually_gathered	the characterization of this world by the dignity of persons, all equally motivated by desires, and by the adequacy of the objects that equip it already encompasses the principle of coordination, competition, which can be made explicit in the justifications to which tests give rise. 
2046	market	1	Manually_gathered	viewed from the outside, the constitutive convention of competition plays the same role as the conventions that serve as higher common principles in the other worlds. 
2047	market	1	Manually_gathered	the construction of the market is neither more nor less a metaphysics than the construction of the orders that refer to trust and tradition or to the general will. 
2048	market	1	Manually_gathered	the competition between beings placed in a state of rivalry governs their conflicts through an evaluation of market worth, the price, which expresses the importance of converging desires. 
2049	market	1	Manually_gathered	worthy objects are salable goods that have a strong position in a market. 
2050	market	1	Manually_gathered	worthy persons are rich, millionaires, and they live the high life. 
2051	market	1	Manually_gathered	their wealth allows them to have what others want, valuable objects, luxury items, upscale products. 
2052	market	1	Manually_gathered	their wealth is proportionally to their own value, which they know how to sell, and which is expressed by their success, designated in particular by the vocabulary of competition: getting ahead, challenging oneself, taking the edge, being a winner, a top dog. 
2053	market	1	Manually_gathered	the deployment of market worth is inscribed in a space that has neither limits nor distance, in which the circulation of goods and persons is free.

2055	market	1	Manually_gathered	market worth does not participate in a construction of time.

2060	market	1	Manually_gathered	fate can usually be made to tum out in one\'s favor, transformed into good luck, if people exploit the situation opportunistically and take advantage of opportunities that arise. 
2061	market	1	Manually_gathered	the state of unworthiness is one in which persons fail, stagnate, and lose out, and in which goods are rejected, spurned, hated, instead of desired.

2070	market	1	Manually_gathered	"at an annual sales convention, the president of a dog food company summed up the situation this way: \'over the past few days,\' he began, \'we\'ve heard from all our division heads and of their wonderful plans for the coming year. if we have the best advertising, the best marketing, the best sales force, how come we sell less goddamn dog food than anyone else in the business?\' absolute silence filled the convention hall. finally, after what seemed like forever, a small voice answered from the back of the room: \'because the dogs hate it\'"" (117). """
2071	market	1	Manually_gathered	since dignity designates a capacity to participate in a common good, the fact that it takes the form of a selfish desire in the market world is almost paradoxical. 
2072	market	1	Manually_gathered	by recognizing dignity in persons occupied with satisfying their self-centered desires, utilitarian philosophy has contributed to establishing the modem image of the individual detached from the chains of belonging and liberated from the weight of hierarchies. 
2073	market	1	Manually_gathered	however, the success of the figure of the individual has been largely dependent on proof that individuals can find a place in an order in which their actions are coordinated with those of others. 
2074	market	1	Manually_gathered	political philosophies have demonstrated the benefits of competition only by establishing this possibility of coordination, which makes it possible, today, to refer to a market polity. 
2075	market	1	Manually_gathered	"only if one loses sight of the convention that creates bonds between people as individuals- a convention that operates via their desire for the same objects-and if one forgets the way in which this convention of competition governs its own free play, do the terms individual"" or ""freedom"" become susceptible to the semantic slippages that lead to the presentation of the market world as the sole guarantor of people\'s autonomy and freedom. """
2076	market	1	Manually_gathered	the market world is thus populated with individuals seeking to satisfy desires; they are in turn clients_ and competitors, buyers, and sellers, entering into relations with one another as businessmen. 
2077	market	1	Manually_gathered	the fact that the deployment of objects is required for market coordination becomes obvious, in contrast, when the identity of market objects is lacking. 
2078	market	1	Manually_gathered	an object of a market nature is a thing toward which competing desires for possession converge: it is a desirable, salable, marketable thing. 
2079	market	1	Manually_gathered	the identification that is common to market objects inscribes them as inalienable property, objects that are common to diverse desires. 
2080	market	1	Manually_gathered	let us note that of all the social sciences, economics is the one that grants the most space to objects, although the status of these objects is not made clear in economic theory. 
2081	market	1	Manually_gathered	market goods are so natural that their role is rarely addressed, apart from considerations about public or collective goods. 
2082	market	1	Manually_gathered	recent theoretical developments regarding the quality of goods do touch on the crucial hypothesis of a common identification of objects, but the problems raised are reduced to a matter of asymmetrical information. 
2083	market	1	Manually_gathered	the value of the item is determined in a market test, and problems dealt with as instances of cheating on real quality are raised by the implicit reference to a different form of value, often industrial in nature (eymard duvernay 1989b, p. 12 7). 
2084	market	1	Manually_gathered	similarly, the implications of a theoretical slippage from a market of goods to a market of contracts are not clearly distinguished, since the role of the hypothesis of the objectivity of a medium for the expression of competing desires is not taken into account. 
2085	market	1	Manually_gathered	the common identification of objects of a market nature is closely linked to the requirements of aggrandizement in a market world, to the investment formula that ensures access to the common good by means of a sacrifice. 
2086	market	1	Manually_gathered	the selfishness of subjects in the market world has to go hand in hand, if any order is to result from their competition, with clear-sightedness as to the limits of selves; this is the other side of the picture, where the common identification of external goods is concerned. 
2087	market	1	Manually_gathered	this requirement, often forgotten in methodological or political approaches to individualism, is the one that defines the individual as a social being, socialized by desires that converge toward external goods. 
2088	market	1	Manually_gathered	in the market world, people are thus detached from one another (and in particular from any domestic bond), liberated in such a way that they lend themselves willingly to every opportunity to engage in a transaction. 
2089	market	1	Manually_gathered	in short, subjects are as available as goods on the market. 
2090	market	1	Manually_gathered	here, too, the adoption of this approach to the market world makes it possible to dispel ambiguities about freedom and liberalism. 
2091	market	1	Manually_gathered	it might be preferable to recognize that the freedom of free-market liberalism has meaning only insofar as it is an expression of choice for external goods, and that this externality is acquired only if one starts out with a detachment that presupposes seeing others the way one sees oneself. 
2092	market	1	Manually_gathered	"the opportunism that characterizes the worthy those who know how to make the most of everything, in the market world- thus goes hand in hand, unparadoxically, with a certain attention to others that presupposes the ability to listen, really to hear what someone is saying"" (mccormack 1984, 8) (inasmuch as others are detached individuals themselves, and not inasmuch as they form an opinion from which one has to protect oneself, like ""the others"" in the world of fame). """
2093	market	1	Manually_gathered	this attention does not serve to temper selfishness; it is consubstantial with selfishness in the market order. 
2094	market	1	Manually_gathered	"just as the work by adam smith from which we extracted the canonical presentation of market worth invites us to associate a theory of the wealth of nations foregrounding the principle of competition, on the one hand, with a theory of moral sentiments based on the position of impartial spectator and sympathy, on the other, the manual we are using here makes visible the relation between the satisfactory progress of business and a state of persons characterized by detachment with regard to themselves (a distance that recalls the equal distances with respect to great and small objects"" at which smith positioned_ the spectator) and by attention to others. """
2095	market	1	Manually_gathered	even if the market world is not reduced to a collection of atoms deprived of connections with one another market relations propagated in networks can easily be contrasted with hierarchical relations embedded one within another. 
2096	market	1	Manually_gathered	and yet the market order also espouses the order of the general and the particular that implies such embedding. 
2097	market	1	Manually_gathered	market worth is not so very different from the worths that serve as examples for the notion of hierarchy, the domestic order of authority, or the industrial order of competence. 
2098	market	1	Manually_gathered	since market objects encompass the desires of others, their possession implies a hierarchical relation in the ordinary sense of the term. 
2099	market	1	Manually_gathered	the state of worthiness encompasses the state of unworthiness in a relation of possession. 
2100	market	1	Manually_gathered	the price of an object is the proof of the attachment of others to the good that one is holding. 
2101	market	1	Manually_gathered	since not all persons can satisfy their appetites equally by acceding to the same rare goods, the wealthiest incorporate the others by possessing the desire of those who are less wealthy and who remain deprived of goods. 
2102	market	1	Manually_gathered	millionaires are defined by their possession of things everyone wants.

2105	market	1	Manually_gathered	the object, a good or a service, helps to fashion a link between people by attracting, by interesting. 
2106	market	1	Manually_gathered	the transaction presupposes that people have enough perspective and that the object is detached enough to allow the play of competition with others. 
2107	market	1	Manually_gathered	local transactions thus exceed settlements and become a market that takes into account the entire set of the others\' desires through the prices that will be negotiated and paid. 
2108	market	1	Manually_gathered	the assemblages are coherent when the market beings are of the same worth, when the product is well positioned in relation to the buyer and the seller. 
2109	market	1	Manually_gathered	this operation takes into account the reality of the buyer\'s desire for the object. 
2110	market	1	Manually_gathered	at the end of this harmonious process of composition, the persons doing business find their worth naturally in relation to the object negotiated. 
2111	market	1	Manually_gathered	"being in a business deal that holds together requires persons who meet, often face to face, to negotiate head to head, far from the influence of others; they must take one another\'s measure accurately and never underestimate [the] competition"" (205). """
2112	market	1	Manually_gathered	the harmony of the natural order stems from the way in which goods acquire their price in a market that determines the distribution of states of worth. 
2113	market	1	Manually_gathered	the test is the moment, uncertain in its outcome, when a deal is done, settled, in the bag. 
2114	market	1	Manually_gathered	the end of the test is expressed by the signing of a contract. 
2115	market	1	Manually_gathered	the test is also an opportunity to extract new objects from chaos, to discover new things that might interest a client and give rise to a transaction and opportunity to extend the market world. 
2116	market	1	Manually_gathered	the common identification of goods and the generality of the worth known as price associates the face-to-face aspect of a business deal with other transactions taking place elsewhere, with other individuals; these can thus be equated. 
2117	market	1	Manually_gathered	price, which sanctions the test by modifying the distribution of worths, takes into account the negotiation between the two subjects involved. 
2118	market	1	Manually_gathered	but this takes place on the horizon of a general price, a requirement expressed in the fact that the price has to be reasonable and must correspond to the real value. 
2119	market	1	Manually_gathered	the generality of the price is ensured by a monetary standard. 
2120	market	1	Manually_gathered	money is the measure of all things, and thus constitutes the form of evidence. 
2121	market	1	Manually_gathered	the profit, the benefit, the payback, the result of the transaction is thus expressed in cash, a commission, a fee, or an honorarium. 
2122	market	1	Manually_gathered	this place assigned to money in market world tests does not allow us to settle any debates over monetary theory, of course, but it suggests that money, in its function of reserve value attached to a projection onto the future, is an ambiguous entity that opens up a passageway to other worlds.

2812	industrial	1	Manually_gathered	another category of justifications includes arguments where evaluations depend on technical efficiency and professionalism, planning, and longterm investment in infrastructure. 
2813	industrial	1	Manually_gathered	this category relates to the industrial order of worth in the boltanski and thevenot (1991) scheme, but industrial here is not limited to the industrial economic sector. 
2814	industrial	1	Manually_gathered	while technical competency and planning arguments are sometimes connected as such to economic outcomes, the bases for evaluation in this category are different from market criteria. 
2815	industrial	1	Manually_gathered	technical competency justifications place value based on the efficiency of investments, professional planning and expertise, and long-term growth. 
2816	industrial	1	Manually_gathered	the form of proof for planning justifications is long-term investment and technical or scientific competency.  
2817	industrial	1	Manually_gathered	they envision nature as a scarce economic resource with multiple potential uses energy, recreation, income for the county which must be used efficiently. 
2818	industrial	1	Manually_gathered	also, both sides utilize a form of proof which is congruent with technical competency justifications the use of scientific expertise and evidence to validate opposite arguments, for example on the question of whether the dam will hurt or help the clavey fish populations. 
2819	industrial	1	Manually_gathered	the project is defended because of the necessity of providing roads, tunnels, and other infrastructure in order for there to be economic growth in the future. this sort of industrial planning argument is extremely influential as an argument for the tunnel project in france, and reflects the well-documented embrace of an engineering mentality or technocratic approach by the french state. 
2820	industrial	1	Manually_gathered	this strong compromise of technical industrial justifications closely connects technocratic planning by the state with the general interest, and this approach is perpetuated through the training of elites in engineering schools for high positions in the state.. 
2821	industrial	1	Manually_gathered	they are both based on the same type of test the long-term efficiency of the project with the same criteria of proof and instruments of evidence (technical evidence from modeling and statistical analysis). 
2822	industrial	1	Manually_gathered	for example, hydropower projects in france were were judged based on their efficiency as long-term investments. in the industrial city, for example, the common superior principle is efficiency. 
2823	industrial	1	Manually_gathered	it can be said: \'in terms of efficiency, x is equivalent to y\'. 
2824	industrial	1	Manually_gathered	similarly, using this same convention, it can be said that \'z is superior or inferior to x\'. 
2825	industrial	1	Manually_gathered	thus, identification of the common superior principle in a city leads us straight to the <condition of great man>, the great man being the one who embodies the city\'s values, as well as to the <condition of little person>, defined by the absence of such values. 
2826	industrial	1	Manually_gathered	thus, someone situated in an \'industrial\' world will readily refer    to \'instruments\', \'methods\', \'measures\' or \'procedures\', invoke \'engineers\' and \'specialists\', and list \'controlling\' or \'organizing\' as among the actions worth performing.

2838	industrial	1	Manually_gathered	the terminology adopted must thus not lead to the assumption that this world is fully inscribed within the limits of industry. 
2839	industrial	1	Manually_gathered	conversely, the workings of an industrial enterprise cannot be understood on the basis of resources stemming from this world alone, even if the aim of efficient production based on functional investments finds its justification in the industrial order. 
2840	industrial	1	Manually_gathered	if, as we shall see, a canonical judgment as to the quality of a scientific phenomenon allows us to illustrate the reality test of the industrial world, the fact remains that the development and diffusion of a discovery cannot be justified simply by the test examined here; these phenomena exceed the framework of the industrial world by a wide margin. 
2841	industrial	1	Manually_gathered	works on the history or the sociology of science and technology bring out the heterogeneity of the resources and actions involved in the processes of innovation, and they are even joined today, on this point, by economic approaches to technological change.

2844	industrial	1	Manually_gathered	still others rely on the worth of fame, a worth that implies a concentration of credit in terms of public opinion based on distinctive signs and marks; others depend on the venerability of domestic bonds guaranteeing a solid reputation or on the establishment of market value in an immediate response to clients\' desires. 
2845	industrial	1	Manually_gathered	just as the recognition of the market order is obscured by a misunderstanding of the conventions that accompany the affirmation of an individual, the understanding of the industrial order is blocked by a treatment of technological objects that locks them into an instrumental relation to nature and fails to examine the conventions supporting agreement about the scientific phenomenon in question. 
2846	industrial	1	Manually_gathered	the observation of the conditions under which industrial objects are put to work shows that they lend themselves to the same type of test as the one already identified in the other universes. 
2847	industrial	1	Manually_gathered	testing these beings and establishing their objectivity presupposes a detour through a collective form, a higher common principle that governs the way they are judged.

2864	industrial	1	Manually_gathered	this scale of qualification underlies a hierarchy of states of worth, a hierarchy marked by competencies and responsibilities (management, leaders, decision makers, supervisors, technicians, operators, and so on). in work relations and systems of remuneration, the formal qualities that express industrial worth are opposed both to a market evaluation that would result immediately from a service provided and to a domestic judgment that would evaluate a person\'s authority.

4845	green	1	pdf	. low carbon development the concept of low carbon development has its roots in the unfccc adopted in rio in. in the context of this convention low carbon development is now generally expressed using the term low emission development strategies leds also known as low carbon development strategies or low carbon growth plans.
4846	green	1	pdf	though no formally agreed definition exists leds are generally used to describe forward looking national economic development plans or strategies that encompass low emission and or climate resilient economic growth oecd iea.
4847	green	1	pdf	leds have attracted interest in the climate negotiations as a soft alternative to voluntary or obligatory ghg emission reduction targets in developing countries ecn .
4848	green	1	pdf	the initial proposal to introduce leds was put forward by the eu in  highlighting how information on planned low carbon pathways can help to inform the international community about funding needs and priorities and to help gauge the level of global climate change action oecd iea.
4849	green	1	pdf	the concept has been included in the negotiating texts under the unfccc since the run up to cop in copenhagen in and is part of both the copenhagen accord unfccc  and the cancun agreements unfccc   which recognize that a leds is indispensible to sustainable development and that incentives are required to support the development of such strategies in developing countries.
4850	green	1	pdf	though not clearly implied by the terminology leds are understood to also include provisions to reduce vulnerability to climate change impacts.
4851	green	1	pdf	the discourse of integrating climate change and development builds on a large body of literature which was assessed by the ipcc in its fourth assessment report sathaye et al.   and distinguished between the traditional climate first approach and a development first approach odi .
4852	green	1	pdf	the concept of low carbon development takes a development first approach which rethinks development planning and proposes structural solutions such as alternative infrastructure and spatial planning with lower emission trajectories morita et al.
4853	green	1	pdf	it focuses on addressing and integrating climate change with development objectives and is therefore a more useful approach for developing countries.
4854	green	1	pdf	in practice the plans are often combinations of new and existing elements all combined in a new way to address pre existing policy objectives along with the need to slow climate change and prepare for its impacts.
4855	green	1	pdf	outside of the unfccc the concept has also gained recognition and support by world leaders including at the major economies forum in italy in july where leaders declared that their countries would prepare low carbon growth plans.
4856	green	1	pdf	a growing number of international organizations and consultancies have also been involved in low carbon development programs including the undp unep the world bank including through its energy sector management the major economies participating in the mef are australia brazil canada china the european union france germany india indonesia italy japan korea mexico russia south africa the united kingdom and the united states.

4861	green	1	pdf	the document also goes some way to defining low emission development as forward looking national economic development plans or strategies that encompass low emission and or climate resilient growth.
4862	green	1	pdf	the publication recognises that the term leds is a relatively new concept first used by unfccc in but that its use has been becoming more and more frequent and currently is mentioned in negotiating texts from cop and beyond including the copenhagen accord which recognised that a leds is indispensable to sustainable development.

4930	green	1	pdf	a main driver behind the development of these concepts has been the move towards a more integrated and holistic approach to incorporating environment and development in economic decision making policy and planning.
4931	green	1	pdf	whilst the terms green economy and green growth might imply a strong focus on the intersection between environment and the economy many of the definitions of these terms from recent publications clearly also incorporate a social emphasis see appendix.

4940	green	1	pdf	in this regard low carbon development can be seen as a subset of both green growth and green economy.
4941	green	1	pdf	importantly many definitions of green economy include a united nations. a guide to the green economy reference to ecological limits or planetary boundaries which are references to the scientific article which identifies nine planetary boundaries that define the safe operating space for humanity with respect to the earth system and associated with the planet s biophysical subsystems or processes see rockstrom et al .
4942	green	1	pdf	interestingly this reference has not been included in definitions of green growth.
4943	green	1	pdf	the international chamber of commerce propose a key difference between green growth and green economy i.e.
4944	green	1	pdf	that green growth is a bottom up approach of greening products processes services technologies and supply chains compared with the top down approach of green economy which involves strategic macro economic policies addressing systemic challenges.
4945	green	1	pdf	others highlight that green growth more so than the multidimensional concept of green economy represents a new global compromise position which may be seen as a weak step forward but one that has the potential to unite many different factions around a goal that many see as transformative atkisson .
4946	green	1	pdf	overall the various definitions of green growth and green economy are generally consistent both having sustainable development as their ultimate objective and being a means to reconcile the economic and environmental pillars without ignoring social aspects world bank .
4947	green	1	pdf	as such the distinction between the terms is probably of little relevance.
4948	green	1	pdf	however the approaches to green economy and green growth can be seen to cover a spectrum of different shades of green  from narrow concerns about climate change on the one hand in line with initial approaches to low carbon growth  to larger critiques of the environmental sustainability of modern capitalism on the other green growth leaders .
4949	green	1	pdf	in other words and from a scientific perspective the focus varies between addressing one of the planetary boundaries defined by scientists i.e.
4950	green	1	pdf	climate change to more holistically addressing the wider range of resource and ecological limits and the general state of the planet.
4951	green	1	pdf	of course green economy has not been without its critics.
4952	green	1	pdf	criticisms raised include that the concept should not compete with or displace sustainable development and internationally agreed principles that it implies a focus on environmental and economic dimensions to the detriment of the social dimension that it will lead to the financialisation of nature as well as further concentration of market power and global inequality third world network  lander .
