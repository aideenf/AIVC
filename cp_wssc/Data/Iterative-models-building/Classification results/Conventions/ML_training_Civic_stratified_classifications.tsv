In European Elections, Populism is Against People's InterestsAmidst veritable media frenzy, we hear the populists and their critiques loud and clear. It is time that someone stand up for the European project. So let us make the argument loudly: a strong, increasingly federal Europe is the best path to freedom, prosperity, and influence in the world. Interconnectedness is a reality, not a choice. In our era of globalization, national regulation is far less effective than continental regulation, which protects consumers from monopolies and unfair practices. From energy to roaming charges, the EU can regulate imperfect matters more effectively than national bodies ever could. In financial markets, the EU has been at the forefront of better regulation to prevent another crisis: from limits on bonuses to the European Central Bank's banking union, we are building a more resilient banking system to protect both depositors and taxpayers alike. Meanwhile the European single market is the key achievement of the Union that has improved standards of living for citizens in every single member state. Today, it provides a strong incentive for countries in the Union to support each other, a truth born out during the financial crisis.	1.0830881089366171	High	HuffPost_News

How to Read the Week's Economic and Market SignalsExpect next week's policy meetings to signal that central bank stand ready to step in, once again, to maintain the disconnect between buoyant equity markets and sluggish economic conditions -- not as an end in itself but, given Congressional dysfunction, as virtually the only way today to support economic activity (and it is rather imperfect as the expected benefits come with growing costs and risks). Look for the Federal Reserve to alter the thrust of its policy narrative. Rather than advance its prior emphasis on tapering its monthly $85 billion purchases of market securities, it will seek to reassure markets by iterating its willingness to do more if needed. Across the Atlantic, the European Central Bank will face increasing pressure to cut its interest rate (currently at 0.75%) and liberalize the collateral requirements it imposes -- both meant to loosen monetary conditions.	0.7312283881821977	High	HuffPost_News

Sunday RoundupThis week brought a surprise: In a time of rampant division, we saw an entire people -- or at least 55 percent of them -- choose unity instead. On Thursday, 3.6 million Scots went to the polls and chose not to change Great Britain to Somewhat Less Great Britain by voting against severing their 307-year union. Now, after the celebratory champagne and haggis (or whatever one drinks with haggis), comes the hard work of ironing out a new division of power. Less surprising was the continued upheaval in the NFL, as yet another player was arrested for domestic violence. On Friday, Commissioner Roger Goodell pledged to "make changes" and "do better."

40 Percent of American Workers Will Leave Paid Vacation Days UnusedAn important new study released this morning by Travel Effect found that 40 percent of American workers will leave paid vacation days unused. The four reasons cited the most are the dread of returning from a vacation to piles of work (40 percent), the belief that no one will be able to step in and do their job for them while they're gone (35 percent), not being able to afford it (33 percent) and the fear of being seen as replaceable (22 percent). "Americans suffer from a work martyr complex," said Roger Dow, President and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association. "In part, it's because 'busyness' is something we wear as a badge of honor." Clearly, we need to work harder about working smarter -- by not working all the time. The "work martyr" complex needs to go the way of the Dictaphone, typewriter and green eyeshades as relics of the workplace of the past (okay, I like typewriters, but you get the idea).	0.3530368016917095	Medium	HuffPost_News

Sunday RoundupThis week the world was introduced to a glorious -- if unlikely -- new couple, united for all time by the matchmakers at the Norwegian Nobel Committee: Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi, recipients of this year's Nobel Peace Prize. She's a 17-year-old Pakistani Muslim; he's a 60-year-old Indian Hindu. Together they're being honored for leading the fight for children's rights -- and against extremism -- worldwide. Malala, of course, is already well-known. After being shot by the Taliban in 2012 for trying to educate herself, she courageously spoke up even louder. "They can only shoot a body; they cannot shoot my dreams," she said. Satyarthi, meanwhile, leads a consortium called the Global March Against Child Labor, a cause he's been championing for decades. There's a lot wrong with the world, and the committee's inspired choice is a reminder -- and a challenge -- that we can all do more to make it a better place.	0.32673144244646923	Medium	HuffPost_News

Sunday RoundupThis week, the country had a national teach-in about domestic violence courtesy of a grainy elevator video showing Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice knocking out his then-fiancée Janay Palmer. The dark, disturbing images sparked the soul-searching coast-to-coast conversation this issue deserves. In the two days after the video's release, calls to the National Domestic Abuse Hotline shot up 84 percent. And while some shamefully implied that victims who stay in abusive relationships are somehow culpable for their abuse, the hashtag #WhyIStayed, begun by Beverly Gooden, provided a harrowing array of deeply poignant answers. Though questions remain about what NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell knew and when he knew it, it's clear this issue goes far beyond the NFL. Ray Rice is just the tip of the iceberg -- beneath it lies a culture and legal system that perpetuates this kind of violence in millions of cases that we never see.	0.3029364223323499	Medium	HuffPost_News
