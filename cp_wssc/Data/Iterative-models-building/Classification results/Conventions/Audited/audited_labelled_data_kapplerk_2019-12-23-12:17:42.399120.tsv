The rapid online adaptation is shown by learning unknown workspace constraints sample-efficiently from few physical interactions while following given way points.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
In particular, our solvers won the partial MaxSAT industrial category from 2010 through 2012 and ranked second in the 2017 main weighted track of the MaxSAT evaluation.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
We evaluate the effectiveness of our model via a case study on real data; in addition, we design two quantitative measures, called social entropy and community score, to evaluate the quality of the discovered clusters.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Many outstanding studies have reported great results in providing sensible indirect (warning systems) or direct (interactive neural stimulation) control over refractory seizures, some of which achieved high performance.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
A set of comparative evaluations shows the robustness of our approach with respect to noise and occlusions.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
In order to investigate these and other issues, we had a mobile robot reach out and push 47 different objects found in a real home over a three day period resulting in 1340 pushing episodes.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
When more sensory modalities were occupied or when the cognitive load was very low, driver take-over performance was impaired, especially when the take-over request was too late (e.g., lead time was 3 s).	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Soft robotics is a growing field of research concerned with the development of electromechanical technology composed of compliant materials or structures.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
These oscillations were suppressed by increased dopamine activity -Â revealing a possible link with symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
However, due to the fundamentally different structure of the sensor's output, new algorithms that exploit the high temporal resolution and the asynchronous nature of the sensor are required.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
Furthermore, they are generally coupled and nonlinear, which makes the reconstruction inaccurate.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
In particular, we solved newly derived recursive maps using as an example a biologically relevant driving-driven neural network with a dynamic feedback loop.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called learning from label proportions based on random forests (LLP-RF), which has the advantage of dealing with high-dimensional LLP problem.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
The experimental validations of this sonification strategy are presented, followed by a conclusion and a few theoretical perspectives.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
The synthesis procedure is based on the solution of a game where the edit function must react to the system moves by suitable output editing.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
This paper provides a definition for shared control in context with previous definitions, and a set of general axioms for design and evaluation of shared control solutions.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
A scaled down version of the design is used in a two-fingered gripper and different grasp modes are achieved by activating different sets of joints.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
We furthermore combine this approach with robust homing so that the robot can navigate back to its starting location even if the mapping system fails and does not produce a consistent map.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Flexibility is achieved when different kinds of norms share the same interpretation about the environmental state.	s2_ai	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
The policy is trained on the real quadrotor, which requires collision-free exploration around the example path.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
The algorithm makes use of a voxel distance grid, which is updated based on perceptual information acquired from the robot's perception system.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
