Is it possible that we stumble into a limitation of AI and that consciousness is simply not possible or do we have good reasons to think otherwise? AI as it is currently used in Data Science borrows from nature basic concepts and adapts them to be used in a specific problem or set or problems, so the limitations are by design and purpose of our current AI's; an AI whose purpose is to be conscious ( a CAI ) has to follow a different design.	reddit_ai	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
