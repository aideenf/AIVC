"It resembles the nice architecture used in ""googles neural machine translation system: bridging the gap between human and machine translation"", without an attention mechanism, and with just the encoder part as a ""many to one"" architecture instead of a ""many to many"" to be adapted to the human activity recognition (har) problem."	github_ai	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
But we didn't test that.nupic users etaler tho provides basically the same feature, is very different from numenta's nupic some noticeable ones are: data orientated design instead of object orientated no network api (planned in the future, by another repo) sdr is handled as a tensor instead of a sparse matrix swarming is not supported nor planned.	github_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Example: scale segmentation maps, average max pool of images maps, pad images to aspect ratios (e.g to square them) example: convert keypoints to distance maps, extract pixels within bounding boxes from images, clip polygon to the image plane,.	github_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Run then navigate to in your browser requires matplotlib 2.0.tests you can run the unit tests using pytest.do sphinx documentation and github wiki make logger as robust and pythonic as possible fix some hacks having to do with support for parallelism (namely vectorize, normalize and monitor) add parallelism distributed implementations.	github_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
