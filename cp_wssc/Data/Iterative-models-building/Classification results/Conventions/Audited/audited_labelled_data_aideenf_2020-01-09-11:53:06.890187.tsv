Realistically I don't see AI solving climate change but it can help marginally by making public transportation and the power grid more efficient for example.	reddit_ai	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
What is your argument here? That climate change is going to happen much, much faster than even current worst case scenarios predict and that this will stop AGI research well before 2050? I think it's more likely that rapid climate change and war would spur investments in AI because it could plausibly help us deal with that.	reddit_ai	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
Today AI is a really great automated statistical tool that helps us in research of both cancer & climate change.	reddit_ai	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
The biggest problems however, climate change for example, have already had solutions proposed by the most powerful neural networks we currently have available: human brains.	reddit_ai	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0
See r agi Yes, there have been and are AGI research projects although they are still relatively rare compared to narrow AI and few have progress that is really far along that I know of.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
I believe that this will not change for many years because this is the nature of the project by design, where emphasis is placed on choosing and tuning components for integration, and on experimenting with novel algorithms and their variations, one research bit at a time.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0
This would be important if we saw 463 exabytes and said, 'Perfect! I needed at least 400 exabytes for this important project!' It is far less important once we acknowledge the true scale of the data.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0
 Hi! I built this guide as part of a 3-month final project in my MSc., which involves communicating AI ethics concepts in a relatable manner.	reddit_ai	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
It's a lot easier talking about your past projects when they're right in front of you, than talking about general academic things you half know.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
Good luck! I would suggest apart from speaking about the past projects, as Zulban suggested, you can also read about the latest trends in the field.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
It's a dead project but probably the most advanced so far.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
Do companies issue their own dollars to make business? Does apple need to issue some applecoin to sell their products? To me, none of the projects sound serious about their business plan and instead they sound more a quick cash grab through ICOs.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0
A comparison would be if AI is nuclear power then projects like OpenCog are working on rechargeable batteries.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
This article was kinda tough to read because there were just so many failed projects.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
