An open question is whether it is possible to compute, in polynomial time, the existence of some variable ordering for which a given instance satisfies m-fBTP.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
This letter particularly focuses on the cooptimization of morphology and controller, by using a mechanism to balance parameter specific costs (i.e., morphology samplings are more expensive than control ones) for effective and efficient design optimization processes.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Ensuring a smooth transition from free motion to contact is crucial as incurring a large impact force may lead to unstable contact with the robot bouncing on the surface, i.e., chattering.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
These results hold the promise of improving robots’ internal model of their human partners, which could increase the safety and productivity of human–robot teams in the factories of the future.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
We call it the multirobot reconnection problem, we show its NP-hardness and hardness of approximation on some important classes of graphs, and we provide optimal and heuristic algorithms to solve it in practical settings.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
In this paper, we survey and synthesize a wide spectrum of existing studies on IM from an <italic>algorithmic perspective</italic>, with a special focus on the following key aspects: (1) a review of well-accepted diffusion models that capture the information diffusion process and build the foundation of the IM problem, (2) a fine-grained taxonomy to classify existing IM algorithms based on their design objectives, (3) a rigorous theoretical comparison of existing IM algorithms, and (4) a comprehensive study on the applications of IM techniques in combining with novel context features of social networks such as topic, location, and time.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Hardwired realization of the proposed learning based planning algorithm, designed for objecttransportation application, confirms the relative merits of the proposed technique over contestant algorithms.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

The novelty of this work is focussend on the addition of an extra locking mechanism to the AMP-Foot 3 which bring additional assets such as natural adaptability to different walking speeds and slopes and an improved energy storage during early stance implying a greater reduction of the power requirements of the motor to only 50W while still being able to produce the peak output torque and power necessary for walking.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
