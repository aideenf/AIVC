The experiments demonstrate that our online PQ model is both time-efficient and effective for ANN search in dynamic large scale databases compared with baseline methods and the idea of partial PQ codebook update further reduces the update cost.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
The first demonstration of a pneumatic soft continuum robot is integrated in series with a rigid robot arm, safely performing teleoperated diathermic tissue-cutting.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
For such difficult problems to be solved daily within short amounts of time, the only practical goal is to obtain near-optimal solutions with quantifiable quality fast.	s2_ai	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
In this paper, we employ systematically organized skeleton features enhanced with directional features, and utilize sparse-group lasso to automatically choose discriminative factors that help in dealing with interactive action recognition and real-time detection tasks.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
The results show that the presence of a mouth, as well as its design, alters the perception of the robot.	s2_ai	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Our proposed unsupervised deep episodic memory model as follows: First, encodes observed actions in a latent vector space and, based on this latent encoding, second, infers most similar episodes previously experienced, third, reconstructs original episodes, and finally, predicts future frames in an end-to-end fashion.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Following the idea of “walking without thinking,” we propose a walking pattern generator that takes into account simultaneously the position and orientation of the feet.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
We empirically show that the proposed network is able to predict both the object label and the actions on GERMS, a dataset for active object recognition.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Experimental results on real benchmark datasets and real world uncertain datasets show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art uncertain data clustering and classification algorithms in effectiveness and performs competitively in efficiency.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
In this study, we present a novel framework for real-time estimation of the cloth state using a low-cost depth sensor, making it suitable for a feasible social implementation.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
