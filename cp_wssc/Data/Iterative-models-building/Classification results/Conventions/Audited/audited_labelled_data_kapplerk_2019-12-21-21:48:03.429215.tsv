These objects have infinite-dimensional configuration space and are computational-expensive to model, making it difficult for real-time tracking, planning and control.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
We demonstrate that this procedure does not preserve some important characters of the deformation, even in the affine case.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
The performance of the proposed technique is demonstrated through real experiments with all the algorithms running onboard in real time.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
The structure is learned from the results of feature learning, and the features are learned to preserve the refined structure of data.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Eighteen objects with different materials and shapes were tested, and results show that the method achieved a recognition accuracy of 92.3% on an average.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
When a new viewer is looking at a stimulus, we first estimate a topology of gaze points (initial gaze points).	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
We note that interesting patterns exist in the occurrence of events, which may serve as discriminative features in event matching.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
However, in many real-life scenarios, only critical vertices on the shortest path are desirable and it is unnecessary to search for the complete path.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
