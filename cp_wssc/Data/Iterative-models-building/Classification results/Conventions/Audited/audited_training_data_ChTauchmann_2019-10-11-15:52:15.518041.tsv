The novelty of the present paper lies in two aspects: (a) the multivector type, (P,Q,R)geomalg, is defined and the definition provides the most important foundation for the formalization of geometric algebra, and (b) a procedure is developed for automatically proving the properties of GA operations.

The design enables the Cheetah to control contact forces during dynamic bounding, with contact times down to 85 ms and peak forces over 450 N. The unique capabilities of the MIT Cheetah, achieving impact-robust force-controlled operation in high-speed three-dimensional running and jumping, suggest wider implementation of this holistic actuation approach.

In contrast to the traditional teleoperation approach, in which the master and slave controllers implement an as-stiff-as-possible coupling between the master and slave devices, our scheme is specifically designed for direct force-reflecting bilateral teleoperation: The slave controller mimics the operator action, whereas the master controller reflects the slave-environment interaction.

Our solution is a three-layer system: first, we propose an offline approach that accounts for transient violations such that the robot can still complete its task after temporary anomalies; the second layer is an online approach that automatically relaxes the environment assumptions to better capture environment behaviors and that allows the robot to react accordingly; and, finally, we automatically modify the actual environment behaviors, when possible, through negotiation with one of the environment robots operating in the workspace, such that our assumptions are met by the other robot and both robots accomplish their tasks.
