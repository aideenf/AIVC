Understanding how images of objects and scenes behave in response to specific egomotions is a crucial aspect of proper visual development, yet existing visual learning methods are conspicuously disconnected from the physical source of their images.	Semantic Scholar	inspired	1	1
In addition, we demonstrate that all signals in the closed-loop auxiliary subsystems are stable in the sense of uniform ultimate boundedness by using classic Lyapunov techniques.	Semantic Scholar	inspired	1	0

Here, we extend the balanced motor primitive framework to simultaneously explain motor learning in unimanual and various bimanual movements as well as the transfer of learning effects between unimanual and various bimanual movements; these phenomena can be simultaneously explained if the mean activity of each primitive for various unimanual movements is balanced with the corresponding mean activity for various bimanual movements.

The mitigation of discomfort is treated as mechanical design and control issues and three solutions are proposed in this letter: 1) a new wearable structure optimizes the strap attachment configuration and suit layout to ameliorate excessive shear forces of conventional wearable structure design; 2) rolling knee joint and double-hinge mechanisms reduce the misalignment in the sagittal and frontal plane, without increasing the mechanical complexity and inertia, respectively; 3) a low impedance mechanical transmission reduces the reflected inertia and damping of the actuator to human, thus the exoskeleton is highlybackdrivable.
