671	537.0	green	1	1	pdf	though no formally agreed definition exists leds are generally used to describe forward looking national economic development plans or strategies that encompass low emission and or climate resilient economic growth oecd iea.
672	538.0	green	1	1	pdf	leds have attracted interest in the climate negotiations as a soft alternative to voluntary or obligatory ghg emission reduction targets in developing countries ecn .
673	539.0	green	1	1	pdf	the initial proposal to introduce leds was put forward by the eu in  highlighting how information on planned low carbon pathways can help to inform the international community about funding needs and priorities and to help gauge the level of global climate change action oecd iea.
674	540.0	green	1	1	pdf	the concept has been included in the negotiating texts under the unfccc since the run up to cop in copenhagen in and is part of both the copenhagen accord unfccc  and the cancun agreements unfccc   which recognize that a leds is indispensible to sustainable development and that incentives are required to support the development of such strategies in developing countries.
675	541.0	green	1	1	pdf	though not clearly implied by the terminology leds are understood to also include provisions to reduce vulnerability to climate change impacts.
676	542.0	green	1	1	pdf	the discourse of integrating climate change and development builds on a large body of literature which was assessed by the ipcc in its fourth assessment report sathaye et al.   and distinguished between the traditional climate first approach and a development first approach odi .
677	543.0	green	1	1	pdf	the concept of low carbon development takes a development first approach which rethinks development planning and proposes structural solutions such as alternative infrastructure and spatial planning with lower emission trajectories morita et al.
678	544.0	green	1	1	pdf	it focuses on addressing and integrating climate change with development objectives and is therefore a more useful approach for developing countries.
679	545.0	green	1	1	pdf	in practice the plans are often combinations of new and existing elements all combined in a new way to address pre existing policy objectives along with the need to slow climate change and prepare for its impacts.
680	546.0	green	1	1	pdf	outside of the unfccc the concept has also gained recognition and support by world leaders including at the major economies forum in italy in july where leaders declared that their countries would prepare low carbon growth plans.
681	547.0	green	1	1	pdf	a growing number of international organizations and consultancies have also been involved in low carbon development programs including the undp unep the world bank including through its energy sector management the major economies participating in the mef are australia brazil canada china the european union france germany india indonesia italy japan korea mexico russia south africa the united kingdom and the united states.

775	641.0	green	1	1	pdf	climate change to more holistically addressing the wider range of resource and ecological limits and the general state of the planet.
776	642.0	green	1	1	pdf	of course green economy has not been without its critics.
777	643.0	green	1	1	pdf	criticisms raised include that the concept should not compete with or displace sustainable development and internationally agreed principles that it implies a focus on environmental and economic dimensions to the detriment of the social dimension that it will lead to the financialisation of nature as well as further concentration of market power and global inequality third world network  lander .
778	644.0	green	1	1	pdf	other risks associated with green economy include that it may attempt to treat countries in the same manner i.e.
779	645.0	green	1	1	pdf	be based on a one size fits all approach  that it may result in trade protectionism that through it some countries may attempt to gain enhanced market access for their products achieving commercial advantage and that it may place new conditionalities on developing countries for aid loans and debt relief khor .

782	648.0	green	1	1	pdf	more recent references to an equitable green economy or inclusive green growth are clearly attempting more holistically to integrate the three dimensions of sustainable development for example see the no to the green economy campaign http nogreeneconomy.org en united nations. a guide to the green economy into these concepts to allay these concerns.
783	649.0	green	1	1	pdf	however it has also been pointed out that whilst this has been an important development if one follows this track the green economy concept would incorporate so many additional aspects that the concept would become equivalent to sustainable development itself in that sense why bother condezey .
784	650.0	green	1	1	pdf	perhaps a key benefit of the emergence of the green economy concept has been that it has stimulated international attention and renewed global efforts to transform our current unsustainable economic model into one which better aligns with the overarching goals of sustainable development.
785	651.0	green	1	1	pdf	importantly this has included efforts by international organizations major groups think tanks and researchers both supporters and critics alike to develop operational principles for green economy and green growth as well as the elaboration of policy toolkits and suites of measures that can be adopted by national governments to shift to a more sustainable economic framework.
786	652.0	green	1	1	pdf	there is also an emerging international practice as national governments in all regions adopt what could be classified as green economy policies with some countries taking a leading role in developing overarching national green economy strategies that integrate with long term development strategies.
787	653.0	green	1	1	pdf	in this regard the green economy and related concepts have succeeded in reinvigorating global debate on how to redefine our economic model to achieve the overarching agreed goal of sustainable development.
788	654.0	green	1	1	pdf	it is likely that the concepts of green economy and green growth will further converge in coming years and continue to gather momentum as more influential international organizations as well as national governments adopt the concepts into their programs and policy agendas.
789	655.0	green	1	1	pdf	during this process it will be critical that proponents of green economy effectively take onboard the concerns raised and address the risks associated with the concept.
790	656.0	green	1	1	pdf	the development of agreed green economy principles policy toolkits and databases of good practice will contribute in this regard.

536		green	1	1	pdf	. low carbon development the concept of low carbon development has its roots in the unfccc adopted in rio in. in the context of this convention low carbon development is now generally expressed using the term low emission development strategies leds also known as low carbon development strategies or low carbon growth plans.
537		green	1	1	pdf	though no formally agreed definition exists leds are generally used to describe forward looking national economic development plans or strategies that encompass low emission and or climate resilient economic growth oecd iea.
538		green	1	1	pdf	leds have attracted interest in the climate negotiations as a soft alternative to voluntary or obligatory ghg emission reduction targets in developing countries ecn .
539		green	1	1	pdf	the initial proposal to introduce leds was put forward by the eu in  highlighting how information on planned low carbon pathways can help to inform the international community about funding needs and priorities and to help gauge the level of global climate change action oecd iea.
540		green	1	1	pdf	the concept has been included in the negotiating texts under the unfccc since the run up to cop in copenhagen in and is part of both the copenhagen accord unfccc  and the cancun agreements unfccc   which recognize that a leds is indispensible to sustainable development and that incentives are required to support the development of such strategies in developing countries.
541		green	1	1	pdf	though not clearly implied by the terminology leds are understood to also include provisions to reduce vulnerability to climate change impacts.
542		green	1	1	pdf	the discourse of integrating climate change and development builds on a large body of literature which was assessed by the ipcc in its fourth assessment report sathaye et al.   and distinguished between the traditional climate first approach and a development first approach odi .
543		green	1	1	pdf	the concept of low carbon development takes a development first approach which rethinks development planning and proposes structural solutions such as alternative infrastructure and spatial planning with lower emission trajectories morita et al.
544		green	1	1	pdf	it focuses on addressing and integrating climate change with development objectives and is therefore a more useful approach for developing countries.
545		green	1	1	pdf	in practice the plans are often combinations of new and existing elements all combined in a new way to address pre existing policy objectives along with the need to slow climate change and prepare for its impacts.
546		green	1	1	pdf	outside of the unfccc the concept has also gained recognition and support by world leaders including at the major economies forum in italy in july where leaders declared that their countries would prepare low carbon growth plans.
547		green	1	1	pdf	a growing number of international organizations and consultancies have also been involved in low carbon development programs including the undp unep the world bank including through its energy sector management the major economies participating in the mef are australia brazil canada china the european union france germany india indonesia italy japan korea mexico russia south africa the united kingdom and the united states.

553		green	1	1	pdf	the publication recognises that the term leds is a relatively new concept first used by unfccc in but that its use has been becoming more and more frequent and currently is mentioned in negotiating texts from cop and beyond including the copenhagen accord which recognised that a leds is indispensable to sustainable development.

621		green	1	1	pdf	a main driver behind the development of these concepts has been the move towards a more integrated and holistic approach to incorporating environment and development in economic decision making policy and planning.
622		green	1	1	pdf	whilst the terms green economy and green growth might imply a strong focus on the intersection between environment and the economy many of the definitions of these terms from recent publications clearly also incorporate a social emphasis see appendix.

630		green	1	1	pdf	whilst this analysis is illustrative there is clearly significant overlap between the two concepts including language around growth and economic development environmental protection low carbon development resilience resource efficiency ecological sustainability human well being inclusiveness and equity.
631		green	1	1	pdf	in this regard low carbon development can be seen as a subset of both green growth and green economy.
632		green	1	1	pdf	importantly many definitions of green economy include a united nations. a guide to the green economy reference to ecological limits or planetary boundaries which are references to the scientific article which identifies nine planetary boundaries that define the safe operating space for humanity with respect to the earth system and associated with the planet s biophysical subsystems or processes see rockstrom et al .
633		green	1	1	pdf	interestingly this reference has not been included in definitions of green growth.
634		green	1	1	pdf	the international chamber of commerce propose a key difference between green growth and green economy i.e.
635		green	1	1	pdf	that green growth is a bottom up approach of greening products processes services technologies and supply chains compared with the top down approach of green economy which involves strategic macro economic policies addressing systemic challenges.
636		green	1	1	pdf	others highlight that green growth more so than the multidimensional concept of green economy represents a new global compromise position which may be seen as a weak step forward but one that has the potential to unite many different factions around a goal that many see as transformative atkisson .
637		green	1	1	pdf	overall the various definitions of green growth and green economy are generally consistent both having sustainable development as their ultimate objective and being a means to reconcile the economic and environmental pillars without ignoring social aspects world bank .
638		green	1	1	pdf	as such the distinction between the terms is probably of little relevance.
639		green	1	1	pdf	however the approaches to green economy and green growth can be seen to cover a spectrum of different shades of green  from narrow concerns about climate change on the one hand in line with initial approaches to low carbon growth  to larger critiques of the environmental sustainability of modern capitalism on the other green growth leaders .
640		green	1	1	pdf	in other words and from a scientific perspective the focus varies between addressing one of the planetary boundaries defined by scientists i.e.
641		green	1	1	pdf	climate change to more holistically addressing the wider range of resource and ecological limits and the general state of the planet.
642		green	1	1	pdf	of course green economy has not been without its critics.
643		green	1	1	pdf	criticisms raised include that the concept should not compete with or displace sustainable development and internationally agreed principles that it implies a focus on environmental and economic dimensions to the detriment of the social dimension that it will lead to the financialisation of nature as well as further concentration of market power and global inequality third world network  lander .
644		green	1	1	pdf	other risks associated with green economy include that it may attempt to treat countries in the same manner i.e.
645		green	1	1	pdf	be based on a one size fits all approach  that it may result in trade protectionism that through it some countries may attempt to gain enhanced market access for their products achieving commercial advantage and that it may place new conditionalities on developing countries for aid loans and debt relief khor .
646		green	1	1	pdf	critics have also highlighted its failure to do justice to the interdependent relationship between environment protection and inclusive economic and social development dagupta  khor  third world network .
647		green	1	1	pdf	in the context of rio  the relationship of green economy as a means to achieving broader sustainable development and poverty eradication was given a clear emphasis.
648		green	1	1	pdf	more recent references to an equitable green economy or inclusive green growth are clearly attempting more holistically to integrate the three dimensions of sustainable development for example see the no to the green economy campaign http nogreeneconomy.org en united nations. a guide to the green economy into these concepts to allay these concerns.
649		green	1	1	pdf	however it has also been pointed out that whilst this has been an important development if one follows this track the green economy concept would incorporate so many additional aspects that the concept would become equivalent to sustainable development itself in that sense why bother condezey .
