Participants held the end-effector of a robot that traced an elliptic path with either biological (two-thirds power law) or nonbiological velocity profiles.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
And, we address the humancomputer interaction challenge by using a distributed approach that relies on multiple virtual machines working in parallel to carry out randomized scans in different portions of the geographic area in order to generate the active-learning based samples for human annotation.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
The average MEs of the “push” and “pull” mappings were 44.3% and 52.4%, respectively.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

However, instead of using the same forgetting factor for the whole domain, we make it dependent on the local density of samples, which we use to estimate the nonstationarity of the function at any given input point.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Its main novelty lies in its topological structure which is built as an array of interacting elementary motifs shaped like loops.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
The first group minimizes the redundancy of features between each other.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
During teaching, the robot learns both a human–robot interaction model and an object interaction model in order to be able to effectively determine its own behaviors.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
It implies that the proposed model can guide the design of actual memristor-based circuits.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Our research implies that pulse-coupled neural networks with excitable neurons showing a delayed response can perform computations even when working solely with suprathreshold pulses.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Minimax similarity stresses the connectedness of points via mediating elements rather than favoring high mutual similarity.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Control parameters, such as current, water flow rates, SMA predisplacement, and gauge pressure of the compressed air, are identified from the SMA thermal model and from the actuation mechanism.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Therefore, this study proposes a control architecture for acceleration control and discusses how to develop a controller suitable for dynamic object manipulation.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
In this paper, without transforming the second order inertial neural networks into the first order differential systems by some variable substitutions, asymptotic stability and synchronization for a class of delayed inertial neural networks are investigated.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
