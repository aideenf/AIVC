Furthermore, the development of computational power ensures that inefficiency software can be as functional as efficient software with a just price of higher (but not full) CPU load. Nevertheless, neglecting software efficiency will not become an issue, because it is compensated by the still increasing hardware performance as long as the semiconductor industry does not reach its bottleneck.  	efficiency	industrial	0	1
