620	 united nations. a guide to the green economy. a critique of emerging concepts whilst the concepts of green economy green growth and low carbon development have emerged from different sources through the work of different organisations and with different target audiences the distinctions among them have become blurred and they are now being used almost interchangeably.	pdf	green	1	1
621	a main driver behind the development of these concepts has been the move towards a more integrated and holistic approach to incorporating environment and development in economic decision making policy and planning.	pdf	green	1	1
622	whilst the terms green economy and green growth might imply a strong focus on the intersection between environment and the economy many of the definitions of these terms from recent publications clearly also incorporate a social emphasis see appendix.	pdf	green	1	1
623	a summary of key words from the full list of definitions in appendix is provided in table below categorised according to the three dimensions of sustainable development.	pdf	green	1	1
624	table keywords in published definitions of green economy and green growth dimension green economy green growth social economic human well being social equity socially inclusive reduced inequalities better quality of life social development equitable access addressing needs of women and youth.	pdf	green	1	1

629	environmental reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities low carbon resource efficient reduce carbon emissions and pollution enhance energy and resource efficiency prevent loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services within ecological limits of the planet environmental responsibility finite carrying capacity.	pdf	green	1	1
630	whilst this analysis is illustrative there is clearly significant overlap between the two concepts including language around growth and economic development environmental protection low carbon development resilience resource efficiency ecological sustainability human well being inclusiveness and equity.	pdf	green	1	1
631	in this regard low carbon development can be seen as a subset of both green growth and green economy.	pdf	green	1	1
632	importantly many definitions of green economy include a united nations. a guide to the green economy reference to ecological limits or planetary boundaries which are references to the scientific article which identifies nine planetary boundaries that define the safe operating space for humanity with respect to the earth system and associated with the planet s biophysical subsystems or processes see rockstrom et al .	pdf	green	1	1
633	interestingly this reference has not been included in definitions of green growth.	pdf	green	1	1
634	the international chamber of commerce propose a key difference between green growth and green economy i.e.	pdf	green	1	1
635	that green growth is a bottom up approach of greening products processes services technologies and supply chains compared with the top down approach of green economy which involves strategic macro economic policies addressing systemic challenges.	pdf	green	1	1
636	others highlight that green growth more so than the multidimensional concept of green economy represents a new global compromise position which may be seen as a weak step forward but one that has the potential to unite many different factions around a goal that many see as transformative atkisson .	pdf	green	1	1
637	overall the various definitions of green growth and green economy are generally consistent both having sustainable development as their ultimate objective and being a means to reconcile the economic and environmental pillars without ignoring social aspects world bank .	pdf	green	1	1
638	as such the distinction between the terms is probably of little relevance.	pdf	green	1	1
639	however the approaches to green economy and green growth can be seen to cover a spectrum of different shades of green  from narrow concerns about climate change on the one hand in line with initial approaches to low carbon growth  to larger critiques of the environmental sustainability of modern capitalism on the other green growth leaders .	pdf	green	1	1
640	in other words and from a scientific perspective the focus varies between addressing one of the planetary boundaries defined by scientists i.e.	pdf	green	1	1
641	climate change to more holistically addressing the wider range of resource and ecological limits and the general state of the planet.	pdf	green	1	1
642	of course green economy has not been without its critics.	pdf	green	1	1
643	criticisms raised include that the concept should not compete with or displace sustainable development and internationally agreed principles that it implies a focus on environmental and economic dimensions to the detriment of the social dimension that it will lead to the financialisation of nature as well as further concentration of market power and global inequality third world network  lander .	pdf	green	1	1
644	other risks associated with green economy include that it may attempt to treat countries in the same manner i.e.	pdf	green	1	1
645	be based on a one size fits all approach  that it may result in trade protectionism that through it some countries may attempt to gain enhanced market access for their products achieving commercial advantage and that it may place new conditionalities on developing countries for aid loans and debt relief khor .	pdf	green	1	1
646	critics have also highlighted its failure to do justice to the interdependent relationship between environment protection and inclusive economic and social development dagupta  khor  third world network .	pdf	green	1	1
647	in the context of rio  the relationship of green economy as a means to achieving broader sustainable development and poverty eradication was given a clear emphasis.	pdf	green	1	1
648	more recent references to an equitable green economy or inclusive green growth are clearly attempting more holistically to integrate the three dimensions of sustainable development for example see the no to the green economy campaign http nogreeneconomy.org en united nations. a guide to the green economy into these concepts to allay these concerns.	pdf	green	1	1
649	however it has also been pointed out that whilst this has been an important development if one follows this track the green economy concept would incorporate so many additional aspects that the concept would become equivalent to sustainable development itself in that sense why bother condezey .	pdf	green	1	1
650	perhaps a key benefit of the emergence of the green economy concept has been that it has stimulated international attention and renewed global efforts to transform our current unsustainable economic model into one which better aligns with the overarching goals of sustainable development.	pdf	green	1	1
651	importantly this has included efforts by international organizations major groups think tanks and researchers both supporters and critics alike to develop operational principles for green economy and green growth as well as the elaboration of policy toolkits and suites of measures that can be adopted by national governments to shift to a more sustainable economic framework.	pdf	green	1	1
652	there is also an emerging international practice as national governments in all regions adopt what could be classified as green economy policies with some countries taking a leading role in developing overarching national green economy strategies that integrate with long term development strategies.	pdf	green	1	1
653	in this regard the green economy and related concepts have succeeded in reinvigorating global debate on how to redefine our economic model to achieve the overarching agreed goal of sustainable development.	pdf	green	1	1
654	it is likely that the concepts of green economy and green growth will further converge in coming years and continue to gather momentum as more influential international organizations as well as national governments adopt the concepts into their programs and policy agendas.	pdf	green	1	1
655	during this process it will be critical that proponents of green economy effectively take onboard the concerns raised and address the risks associated with the concept.	pdf	green	1	1
656	the development of agreed green economy principles policy toolkits and databases of good practice will contribute in this regard.	pdf	green	1	1
