In addition to comparing some of the most used machine learning models (deep learning, neural network, support vector machine.), we oppose two different types of input for some of these models: using the raw time series or using features extracted from the time series (statistical measures, frequency domain features, geometrical features.	github_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
