The system must be initialized close to a known hand pose and assumes a single (right) hand only no sophisticated background removal or segmentation algorithms has been provided localization segmentation of the hand within the image was designed mostly for egocentric vr usage and relies on seeing where the wrist enters the image frame the dynamics-based tracker depends on a 3d hand model whose size and joint locations closely match the author's example projects must be compiled in release mode (-o3), otherwise the project will not run at interactive framerates.work the approach to dynamic-based tracking was first described by melax et al.	github_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
