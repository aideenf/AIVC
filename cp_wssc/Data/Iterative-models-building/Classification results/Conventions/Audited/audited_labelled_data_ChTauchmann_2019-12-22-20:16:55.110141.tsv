A controllability analysis of the brain is necessary to ensure the feasibility of the brain control.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Previous robots have had difficulty in performing like a human because of their severe limitations of low operating speed, heavy bodies, and simplistic mechanisms.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
In this paper, we investigate the grasping of rigid objects in a unilateral robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS).	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
Theoretical analysis reveals that induced noise can indeed help localizing certain vertices if combined with global descriptors.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
Most commercial optical sorting systems are designed to achieve high throughput, so they use a naive low-latency image processing for object identification.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
In this letter, experiments were conducted to characterize the performances of the glove in terms of its kinematic and grip strength assistances on five healthy participants.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
The experimental evaluation of the proposed technique is achieved in a humanâ€“robot load sharing task as a representative example of coassembly or transportation scenarios in industrial settings.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The results showed that the proposed approach performs better than these kernels and also other commonly used neural decoding methods.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
We use the dynamic texture model to psychophysically probe speed perception in humans using zoom-like changes in the spatial frequency content of the stimulus.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
Specifically, our solution makes use of hierarchical indexes to identify result-yielding regions in the solution space in order to take advantage of result sparseness.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
For this open problem, we present a control-based randomized planner, which produces closed collision-free paths in configuration space and guarantees continuous satisfaction of the task constraints.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
This paper studies the pedestrian recognition and tracking problem for autonomous vehicles using a 3D LiDAR, a classifier trained by SVM (Support Vector Machine) is used to recognize pedestrians, the recognition performance is further improved with the aid of tracking results.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The proposed algorithm application is evaluated by experimental tests in different acceleration bound and existence of external magnetic disturbances for a land vehicle.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
We furthermore combine this approach with robust homing so that the robot can navigate back to its starting location even if the mapping system fails and does not produce a consistent map.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The theoretical results are verified in simulation for the three-CPU manipulator by means of inverse dynamic analyses performed in a multibody software environment; however, the developed methodology is of general use and this letter is aimed at showing how it can be applied to a whole class of spherical parallel robots.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
