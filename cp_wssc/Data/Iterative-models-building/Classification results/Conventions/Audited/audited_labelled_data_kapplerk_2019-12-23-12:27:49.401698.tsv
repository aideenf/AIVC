This second win is pretty exciting though, innit? You say you're a Go enthusiast and have played against some fantastic players.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
That said, this exemplifies what I don't like about most poetry, and sometimes the people who try to get me to like it.	reddit_ai	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1
In fields when everything is new and exciting, podcasts are great ! This actually rings true to me in a lot of ways.	reddit_ai	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
It's pretty long, so you might want to just thumb through each chapter and stop for anything that sounds especially interesting.	reddit_ai	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
Parents are ok with AI that does matching or sorting roles; things like fixing schedules, adjusting course speed, recommending career paths, or filling out the paperwork.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
They could get someone to say anything and even if you didn't actually say it, you could still hang for it.	reddit_ai	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Well first of all you develop an algorithm precise enough to recognize some human shaped objects are not necessarily humans.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
So the real question is, when does an AI experience anything? The things that we call computers today are Turing equivalent.	reddit_ai	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
I'm not too sure what they are to yet but some of the article mention pictures and I will post those as I see them.	reddit_ai	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1
A lightweight version might be nice though, it looks good but runs at maybe 10fps for me so using it is a bit of a chore.	reddit_ai	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
I'm not a professional, but my understanding is that an AI, even a super intelligent one, wouldn't do anything it isn't designed to.	reddit_ai	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
In this letter, we propose a new approach for transferring grasping skills that accumulates grasping knowledge into a category-level canonical model.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
This knowledge is useful for applications like gripping objects in space where a failed grasp could lead to loss of the object.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
