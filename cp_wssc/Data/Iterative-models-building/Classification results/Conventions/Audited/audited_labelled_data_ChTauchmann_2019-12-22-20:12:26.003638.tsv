The new SLAM formulation is derived from the nonlinear least squares (NLS) formulation by mathematically formulating loop-closure cycles as constraints.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
We also explore avenues for future research.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
In particular, the platform-level features summarize the information of a user from his/her history posts in the CQA platform, while the thread-level features model the pairwise competitions of a user with others in his/her answered threads.	s2_ai	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
), up to efficient modelling and detection of features for navigation, namely on the ground, as shown both in 3D lidar approaches (Asvadi et al.)	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Continuous improvement issues are investigated by introducing an indicator to identify the bottleneck care provider whose response time reduction could lead to the largest decrease in patient waiting time.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
Our methods are based on minimizing a suitable proxy or surrogate objective for the partial AUC error.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Moreover, our approach is shown to handle large inter-frame motion and illumination changes much more robustly than its direct counterparts.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

Spatial clustering revealed that it is reasonable to have as many clusters as ski lifts in a ski resort, since skiers tend to choose a dominant ski lift during a skier-day.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Person re-identification is a crucial problem for video surveillance, aiming to discover the correct matches for a probe person image from a set of gallery person images.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The framework is flexible to model query intent in either a flat list or a hierarchy.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
In query processing, we propose a new algorithm, where the order to process features is query-dependent by considering both the cost sharing and the pruning power.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
While efficient computation of two-finger caging grasps is well developed, the computation of three-finger caging grasps has remained a challenging open problem.	s2_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Then a stable near-synchronous state can still exist between type 1 PRC neurons if the PRC shows a left skewness in its shape.	s2_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
