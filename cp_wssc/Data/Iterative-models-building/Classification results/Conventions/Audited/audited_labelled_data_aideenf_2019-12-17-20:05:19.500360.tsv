Do you understand Goedel machines well enough to explain them clearly? I've discussed them a few times in my lab meetings and we're still confused, so I'd really appreciate it if you could.	reddit_ai	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0
One trouble is that what you are doing is not communicating with the computer.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Any steps you can omit are only because someone else has already told the computer how to do it (i.e compiling C to machine code, or interpreting a Ruby script).	reddit_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0

There are lots of examples of just one of these natural language constructs, like Google Calendar's ( or ruby's ( But I think that if you try to make a language that joins lots of these constructs, complexity ensues.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The redundancy and flexibility of our natural language may be fit for us, which have flexible and redundant (and error making) brains, but maybe not for computer software, that we specifically want to be precise and error prone.	reddit_ai	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Or, maybe, we will use these languages in domains where we don't care about occasional errors errors that won't crash the system or show a traceback message, but cause small misunderstandings that won't be noticed immediately.	reddit_ai	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
I suppose the same reason you can not give a person vague instructions, and have them do what you want.	reddit_ai	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
I work with medical images, and though our data mining approach is better at detecting certain stuff than medical experts, we still needed their help in getting an idea of what image features might be important and useful to feed into say, a random forest.	reddit_ai	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
This isn't to say you shouldn't try to think out of the box once in a while though, of course.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
I think it'd be a neat way to get an idea where everyone's research background lies, and possibly open up networking opportunities in the AI field.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
I think that the only problem with this is it puts an emphasis on Graduate studies in it.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
There are still people working on Machine Learning and NLP in their jobs that didn't go to grad school for AI related fields, yet they might know more about it than someone that just started a grad level course.	reddit_ai	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
Well, since AI is a more applied field, we can adapt r evolution's idea for AI and include professionals who work on AI in non academic professions.	reddit_ai	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Maybe I just don't see the point, seeing as my graduate work would lead credence to three different flairs appended to my name, and it is that graduate work which really enforces how little I know.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Kurzweil's singularity doesn't require the brain to be computable.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1
It is both tragic and slightly disappointing that such a circular argument could really escape a mouth of one who is evidently so capable.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
In the article Nicolelis says the following: 'You can t predict whether the stock market will go up or down because you can t compute it' Of course as we all know every single event which occurs in the stock market is a product of a human making a decision correct? And every human decision is a product of the brain state of that individual, including things such as their knowledge and their emotional state.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
If your company builds a controllable AGI that perfectly understands not just the stock market, but how to manipulate the other bots who basically run most stock market trading, overnight you could have a single company have complete control over a single market or the global one.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

Like typing 'create a new appointment tomorrow with Turing' The idea started simple; have it reconize certain keywords ('appointment', 'todo' and 'person' for example), then have it reconize actions that can be pefromed on it ('create', 'check', 'update' for example) and then reconize a bunch of other tokens (date, name, etc) in the same sentences and see if you get enough information to save it to a database.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

Do you know of existing programming languages with a focus on AI? reflection macroing optional types (both dynamic and static typing support like in C ) an easy syntax to create tree structures with Prolog style pattern matching anonymous functions, but at least some syntactic sugar for filter and map debugger with user defined hooks (ability to inspect stack frames etc.) If you don't mind my asking, what experience do you have in programming language design? I'm a webdev mostly, working with PHP and JavaScript.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0
