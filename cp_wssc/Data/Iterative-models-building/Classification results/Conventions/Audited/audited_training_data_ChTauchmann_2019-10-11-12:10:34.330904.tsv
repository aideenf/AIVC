Extraterrestrial drilling is an important sampling method for understanding the formation of another celestial body and finding traces of life beyond earth.	Semantic Scholar	inspired	1	1
Alternatively, factors like the multiplicity of gestures or aesthetics are less dominant.	Semantic Scholar	inspired	1	0
Analysis in a real-world scenario shows that it is possible to automatically learn intuitive visual grasp structures that are consistent with expert-designed grasp taxonomies.	Semantic Scholar	inspired	1	0
Understanding how images of objects and scenes behave in response to specific egomotions is a crucial aspect of proper visual development, yet existing visual learning methods are conspicuously disconnected from the physical source of their images.	Semantic Scholar	inspired	1	0
Most traditional spectral clustering algorithms comprise two independent stages (e.g., first learning continuous labels and then rounding the learned labels into discrete ones), which may cause unpredictable deviation of resultant cluster labels from genuine ones, thereby leading to severe information loss and performance degradation.

To formalize team-level similarity, we adopt the notion of graph kernel of attributed graphs to encompass the two aspects and their interaction.	Semantic Scholar	inspired	1	0

To this end, we make an extensive use of the Boolean reflection methodology.The benefit of this approach is that we can easily derive the proof of several fundamental results on polyhedra, such as Farkas’ Lemma, the duality theorem of linear programming, and Minkowski’s Theorem.

We conclude that we humans are the victims of our own success, our hands so skilled they fill the world with captivating things, our eyes so innocent they follow eagerly.	Semantic Scholar	inspired	1	0
