Many thanks to professor jonathan shewchuck, who taught the course during the spring 2016! here's the reference to his notes (i very much suggest this for a stronger mathematical understanding behind the algorithms): ~jrs papers machlearn.pdf.up your environment if you have not yet installed jupyter on your machine, you'll probably get an error message when you run the above command.os 10.10+, linux, and windows 10 use docker.< 10 and mac os < 10.10 anaconda.should i use? choosing either package is to your discretion; we encourage docker because it will allow you to quickly prototype papers like style transfer '.	github_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1
