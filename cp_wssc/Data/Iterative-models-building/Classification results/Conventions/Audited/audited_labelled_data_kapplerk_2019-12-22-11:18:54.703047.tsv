So the ml algorithm you apply learns from all these features and goes backward to figure out the logic and eventually output a value (in this case).learning this is more difficult, because you have no labels, i.e you don't know the house prices in that area, so the algorithm can't learn, because it has no answers.	github_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
