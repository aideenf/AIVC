This paper describes a real-time feature-based stereo SLAM system that is robust and accurate in a wide variety of conditions â€“indoors, outdoors, with dynamic objects, changing light conditions, fast robot motions and large-scale loops.	Semantic Scholar	green	1	0
This distribution enables reasoning about uncertainty in the posterior classification and, therefore, is of prime importance for robust classification, object-level perception in uncertain and ambiguous scenarios, and for safe autonomy in general.	Semantic Scholar	green	1	0
We show that the model outperforms a set of well-known classification methods in experiments, and its applications in two commercial banks have reduced losses of about 10 million RMB in twelve weeks and significantly improved their business reputation.	Semantic Scholar	green	1	0
Deep-Learning has become a leading strategy for artificial intelligence and is being applied in many fields due to its excellent performance that has surpassed human cognitive abilities in a number of classification and control problems (Ciregan, Meier, & Schmidhuber, 2012; Mnih et al., 2015).

Then, we discuss in detail the SW and associated technological innovations with an emphasis on the most researched areas, generating the most interest for future research and development.	Semantic Scholar	green	1	0
We introduce a new method that can determine not only the trial-to-trial dynamics that accompany the learning of a contingency by a neuron, but also the latency of this learning with respect to the onset of a conditioned stimulus.	Semantic Scholar	green	1	0

The proposed method provides a unified formulation for both the robot-in-charge  mode, where the robot plays a dominant role to follow a desired trajectory, and the human-in-charge  mode, in which the human plays a dominant role to guide the movement of robot.	Semantic Scholar	green	1	0
The motion guidance combined with the well-deployed joint redundancy enables the robot to react on the input of the human in a certain manner, e.g., move out of the way in a certain direction of humans sharing the same workspace while the robot operation of task fulfillment is not affected.

Most existing approaches for online active learning are often based on a family of first-order online learning algorithms, which are simple and efficient but fall short in the slow convergence and sub-optimal solution in exploiting the labeled training data.	Semantic Scholar	green	1	0
Rather, in what is called multi-level governance, institutional designs at lower governance levels (e.g., national legislation at the national level) are governed by higher level institutions (e.g., directives, human rights charters and supranational agreements).	Semantic Scholar	green	1	0
The effectiveness of the B&B framework is evaluated in motion capture of deliberate behavior and in video of spontaneous facial behavior in diverse interpersonal contexts: interviews, small groups of young adults, and parent-infant face-to-face interaction.	Semantic Scholar	green	1	0
Constraint programming has its roots in the Artificial Intelligence area of constraint satisfaction, but along the years many cross-fertilizations with related disciplines have been studied.	Semantic Scholar	green	1	0
We investigate this problem and find that widely-used matrix factorization methods are limited in their ability to capture important details in historical behavior, resulting in relatively low predictive accuracy for these types of problems.	Semantic Scholar	green	1	0

In addition, since business customers very often have different decision makers from the same company, we also incorporate social factors, such as community relationships of the business customers, for further improving overall performances of the missing edge prediction and recommendation.

The proposed technique is evaluated in detail and it is shown that its application in conjunction with certain existing process discovery algorithms significantly improves the quality of the discovered process models and that it scales well to large datasets.	Semantic Scholar	green	1	0
Our second scheme, upper MuVE (uMuVE), further improves the pruning power by setting the upper bounds on the utility of views and allowing interleaved processing of views, at the expense of increased memory usage.	Semantic Scholar	green	1	0
Due to the long and narrow nature of these access pathways, external triangulation at the fulcrum point is very limited or absent, which makes introducing multiple degrees of freedom at the distal end of the instrument necessary.	Semantic Scholar	green	1	0
