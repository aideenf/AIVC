A video I made about the paradox that, while science fiction gave us visions for the future of artificial intelligence, it also hampered popular understanding of its implications.	reddit_ai	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
I want one.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Once we start producing both super intelligent AIâ€™s that also are given great power, we will have the foresight to apply safety features.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
I think some type of animation or highlighting showing which specific nodes you are speaking about would be helpful.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
There was nothing new or really innovative in the model or the approach.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
The TensorFlow API's are open source, so the government doesn't necessarily need Google employees 'helping' them.	reddit_ai	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
Or perhaps we need to incorporate reinforcement learning somehow? Combination of two separate models, an actor and critic, like with how NLP will probably evolve more via RL than with standard supervised learning.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
I suggest focusing on programming.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
That the corrupted establishment like a cornered psycho drug addict starts to threaten everyone around and puts the global peace at risk is loathsome, but not surprising.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
For model based RL it is necessary to provide a model of the world that means something that can simulate how things will develop in the near or distant future.	reddit_ai	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0
Novice AIer here, No worries, all AI researchers are just novices.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
However, once an original idea is taken from these mind sciences, it's usually the case that they will primarily be implemented and improved by (mostly) computer scientists and mathematicians.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
This is really cool, especially because of how well it seems to work.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
If the AI goes from from 1x human intelligence to 1000x human intelligence in the time it takes the AI to go through one evaluation loop, this wont work.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
Can we have some AI here to moderate comments? ;) This is the correct response.	reddit_ai	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
