0,"Consequently, it is orders of magnitude faster than out-of-box open source Caffe , Torch or TensorFlow on a single-node Xeon (i.e., comparable with mainstream GPU). ",efficiency,civic,1,1
0,Verify response time is not more than 4 secs when 1000 users access the website simultaneously. ,efficiency,civic,1,1
0,"Fast out of the box, cache-friendly when you need it. ",efficiency,civic,1,1
0,"Efficiency can be defined as, using the resources optimally where resources could be memory, CPU, time, files, connections, databases etc. ",efficiency,civic,1,1
0,However I have implemented it in a joint way to save time and GPU memory. ,efficiency,civic,1,1
0,This helps save memory while having little effect on performance. ,efficiency,civic,1,1
0,"Main update: Add incremental Reader, which can save 50% memory cost. ",efficiency,civic,1,1
0,"The most common related benchmark would be runtime complexity telling how the performance drops with increasing data or model size (e.g. linear, logarithmic, exponential). ",efficiency,civic,1,1
0,"For such resource constrained environments, performance alone is never sufficient, requiring system designers to carefully balance performance with power, energy, and area. ",efficiency,civic,1,1
0,Scala macros for compile-time generation of ultra-fast JSON codecs. ,efficiency,civic,1,0
0,Reduced memory utilization to increase performance. ,efficiency,civic,0,1
