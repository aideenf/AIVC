Low-Rank Representation (LRR) is arguably one of the most powerful paradigms for Multi-view spectral clustering, which elegantly encodes the multi-view local graph/manifold structures into an intrinsic low-rank self-expressive data similarity embedded in high-dimensional space, to yield a better graph partition than their single-view counterparts.	0.054649680852890015	High	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we revisit it with a fundamentally different perspective by discovering LRR as essentially a latent clustered orthogonal projection based representation winged with an optimized local graph structure for spectral clustering; each column of the representation is fundamentally a cluster basis orthogonal to others to indicate its members, which intuitively projects the view-specific feature representation to be the one spanned by all orthogonal basis to characterize the cluster structures.	0.12074847519397736	High	Semantic Scholar
Upon this finding, we propose our technique with the following: (1) We decompose LRR into latent clustered orthogonal representation via low-rank matrix factorization, to encode the more flexible cluster structures than LRR over primal data objects; (2) We convert the problem of LRR into that of simultaneously learning orthogonal clustered representation and optimized local graph structure for each view; (3) The learned orthogonal clustered representations and local graph structures enjoy the same magnitude for multi-view, so that the ideal multi-view consensus can be readily achieved.	0.15962398052215576	High	Semantic Scholar

Even though people will interact often with others via these agent representatives, little is known about whether people ’ s behavior changes when acting through these agents, when compared to direct interaction with others.	0.14751537144184113	High	Semantic Scholar
Here we show that people ’ s decisions will change in important ways because of these agents; specifically, we showed that interacting via agents is likely to lead people to behave more fairly, when compared to direct interaction with others.	0.041285764425992966	High	Semantic Scholar

To support this argument, we present four experiments: in Experiment 1 we show that people made fairer offers in the ultimatum and impunity games when interacting via agent representatives, when compared to direct interaction; in Experiment 2, participants were less likely to accept unfair offers in these games when agent representatives were involved; in Experiment 3, we show that the act of thinking about the decisions ahead of time—i.e., under the so-called “ strategy method ” —can also lead to increased fairness, even when no agents are involved; and, finally, in Experiment 4 we show that participants were less likely to reach an agreement with unfair counterparts in a negotiation setting.	0.14695143699645996	High	Semantic Scholar

Low-Rank Representation (LRR) is arguably one of the most powerful paradigms for Multi-view spectral clustering, which elegantly encodes the multi-view local graph/manifold structures into an intrinsic low-rank self-expressive data similarity embedded in high-dimensional space, to yield a better graph partition than their single-view counterparts.	0.054649680852890015	High	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we revisit it with a fundamentally different perspective by discovering LRR as essentially a latent clustered orthogonal projection based representation winged with an optimized local graph structure for spectral clustering; each column of the representation is fundamentally a cluster basis orthogonal to others to indicate its members, which intuitively projects the view-specific feature representation to be the one spanned by all orthogonal basis to characterize the cluster structures.	0.12074846029281616	High	Semantic Scholar
Upon this finding, we propose our technique with the following: (1) We decompose LRR into latent clustered orthogonal representation via low-rank matrix factorization, to encode the more flexible cluster structures than LRR over primal data objects; (2) We convert the problem of LRR into that of simultaneously learning orthogonal clustered representation and optimized local graph structure for each view; (3) The learned orthogonal clustered representations and local graph structures enjoy the same magnitude for multi-view, so that the ideal multi-view consensus can be readily achieved.	0.15962399542331696	High	Semantic Scholar

Recently, several algorithms have been proposed for clustering uncertain data, and among them density-based techniques seem promising for handling data uncertainty.	0.04401039332151413	High	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we firstly propose a novel density-based algorithm PDBSCAN, which improves the previous FDBSCAN from the following aspects: (1) it employs a more accurate method to compute the probability that the distance between two uncertain objects is less than or equal to a boundary value, instead of the sampling-based method in FDBSCAN; (2) it introduces new definitions of probability neighborhood, support degree, core object probability, direct reachability probability, thus reducing the complexity and solving the issue of nonadaptive threshold (for core object judgement) in FDBSCAN.	0.3069530725479126	High	Semantic Scholar
Then, we modify the algorithm PDBSCAN to an improved version (PDBSCANi), by using a better cluster assignment strategy to ensure that every object will be assigned to the most appropriate cluster, thus solving the issue of nonadaptive threshold (for direct density reachability judgement) in FDBSCAN.	0.09075161814689636	High	Semantic Scholar

Following Lehky, Kiani, Esteky, and Tanaka (2011 , 2014), where the response statistics of 674 IT neurons to 806 image stimuli are analyzed using three measures (kurtosis, Pareto tail index, and intrinsic dimensionality), we investigate the three issues in this letter using the same three measures: (1) the similarities and differences of the neural response statistics between VGG19 and primate IT cortex, (2) the variation trends of the response statistics of VGG19 neurons at different layers from low to high, and (3) the variation trends of the response statistics of VGG19 neurons when the numbers of stimuli and neurons increase.	0.41294342279434204	High	Semantic Scholar

The method produces solutions that suit diverse preferences effectively, and we analyze the complementary nature of dynamic and quasi-static motions, showing that there exist regimes where transitions between the two are indeed desirable, as reflected in the plans produced.	0.5713881254196167	High	Semantic Scholar
Many recent generative models make use of neural networks to transform the probability distribution of a simple low-dimensional noise process into the complex distribution of the data.	0.06573031842708588	High	Semantic Scholar
This raises the question of whether biological networks operate along similar principles to implement a probabilistic model of the environment through transformations of intrinsic noise processes.	0.044217418879270554	High	Semantic Scholar
This allows us to use the proposed networks in a variational learning setting where stochastic backpropagation is used to optimize a lower bound on the data log likelihood, thereby learning a generative model of the data.	0.4800316095352173	High	Semantic Scholar
The learning framework deals with the hybrid nature of legged systems given by different contact configurations: We use the projection of the rigid body dynamics into a subspace consistent with the contact constraints.	0.06586471945047379	High	Semantic Scholar
As a task-specific example, two parsimonious driver steering models of this nature are developed and tested on a dataset of real and simulated driving in near-limit, low-friction circumstances, indicating a clear preference of one model over the other.	0.7418270111083984	High	Semantic Scholar
By means of closed-loop simulations, it is demonstrated that the parameters of this preferred model can generally be accurately estimated from unperturbed driver steering data, using a simple, open-loop fitting method, as long as the vehicle positioning data are reliable.	0.041697751730680466	High	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a multi-manifold regularized non-negative matrix factorization framework (MMNMF) which can preserve the locally geometrical structure of the manifolds for multi-view clustering.	0.05945301428437233	High	Semantic Scholar

In order to find a low-cost trajectory with computational efficiency, the proposed method expands the RRT tree with long extensions using cross entropy, while the rewiring step of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX"> $\text {RRT} ^ {\ast} $</tex-math> </inline-formula> is used to preserve the asymptotic optimality.	0.5881354212760925	High	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a new unsupervised spectral feature selection method to preserve both the local and global structure of the features as well as the samples.	0.5662726163864136	High	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, our method uses the self-expressiveness of the features to represent each feature by other features for preserving the local structure of features, and a low-rank constraint on the weight matrix to preserve the global structure among samples as well as features.	0.6786233186721802	High	Semantic Scholar
Experimental analysis on 12 benchmark datasets showed that the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art feature selection methods in terms of classification performance.	0.09614722430706024	High	Semantic Scholar

The manufacturing process of OLED displays requires a high accuracy and a highly clean transport system because during the evaporation process, organic materials are inherently sensitive to contamination and uniform deposition of an organic layer is important.	0.5211139917373657	High	Semantic Scholar
Roller-based transfer systems are not suitable for OLED evaporation processes because the roller-based system has a poor driving performance due to nonlinear factors such as friction and generates a large amount of dust.	0.09103318303823471	High	Semantic Scholar
In terms of levitation control performance, the maximum fluctuation of the levitation airgap at a standstill is 15.3 <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX"> $\mu $</tex-math> </inline-formula> m <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX"> $_ {pp} $</tex-math> </inline-formula>, and in low-speed and high-speed operation modes, it is 95.0 and 282.3 <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX"> $\mu $</tex-math> </inline-formula> m <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX"> $_ {pp} $</tex-math> </inline-formula>, respectively.	0.06157707795500755	High	Semantic Scholar
To achieve such a highly precise control, especially under vacuum, novel control algorithms such as intelligent section control are applied to minimize abrupt changes in the activation of electromagnets as the carrier moves, and command shaping algorithms are applied to prevent excitation of the resonance mode of the system while at a higher control bandwidth.	0.14641638100147247	High	Semantic Scholar
Spike synchrony, which occurs in various cortical areas in response to specific perception, action, and memory tasks, has sparked a long-standing debate on the nature of temporal organization in cortex.	0.179233118891716	High	Semantic Scholar
Given the ubiquity of small, strongly excitatory subnetworks in cortex, we thus propose that many experimental observations of spike synchrony can be viewed as signs of input patterns that resemble long-term experience—that is, of patterns with high prior probability.	0.32337456941604614	High	Semantic Scholar
Cloth manipulation by robots is gaining popularity among researchers because of its relevance, mainly (but not only) in domestic and assistive robotics.	0.12064681947231293	High	Semantic Scholar
The required science and technologies begin to be ripe for the challenges posed by the manipulation of soft materials, and many contributions have appeared in the last years.	0.2215547412633896	High	Semantic Scholar
This survey provides a systematic review of existing techniques for the basic perceptual tasks of grasp point localization, state estimation and classification of cloth items, from the perspective of their manipulation by robots.	0.16870255768299103	High	Semantic Scholar
This choice is grounded on the fact that any manipulative action requires to instruct the robot where to grasp, and most garment handling activities depend on the correct recognition of the type to which the particular cloth item belongs and its state.	0.4171331226825714	High	Semantic Scholar
The high interand intraclass variability of garments, the continuous nature of the possible deformations of cloth and the evident difficulties in predicting their localization and extension on the garment piece are challenges that have encouraged the researchers to provide a plethora of methods to confront such problems, with some promising results.	0.24122211337089539	High	Semantic Scholar
The present review constitutes for the first time an effort in furnishing a structured framework of these works, with the aim of helping future contributors to gain both insight and perspective on the subject.	0.6488011479377747	High	Semantic Scholar
However, as the service provider is often a third-party delegate of the data owner, the integrity of the query results cannot be guaranteed and is thus imperative to be authenticated.	0.11086421459913254	High	Semantic Scholar
Using these protocols as building blocks, we present a privacy-preserving authentication framework for various aggregate queries and further optimize their authentication performance.	0.24650566279888153	High	Semantic Scholar

Considering a set of robotic tasks which involve physical interaction with the environment, the theoretical knowledge of the full force capacity of the manipulator is a key factor in the design or development of an efficient and economically attractive solution.	0.7143139839172363	High	Semantic Scholar
It may be impossible to withstand a physical interaction in some configurations, while it may be easily sustainable in others that bring the end-effector to the same location.	0.05007587745785713	High	Semantic Scholar
This letter describes a framework for these kind of operations, in which kinematic redundancy is used to explore the full extent of a force capacity for a given manipulator and task (in this letter, the terms “ force ” and “ wrench ” may interchangeably refer to two-, three-, or six-dimensional forces depending on the dimension of the problem and on whether they may or may not include components of translational forces and/or moments.	0.2768172025680542	High	Semantic Scholar
The FCI offers a sound basis for redundancy resolution via optimization or complete redundancy exploration, and may provide good hints for end-effector design.	0.14529527723789215	High	Semantic Scholar
In this kind of task, biased sampling occurs because samples are obtained from specific trajectories dictated by the dynamics of the environment and are usually concentrated in particular convergence regions, which in the long term tend to dominate the approximation in the less sampled regions.	0.6825435161590576	High	Semantic Scholar
The nonstationarity comes from the recursive nature of the estimations typical of temporal difference methods.	0.07427918910980225	High	Semantic Scholar
This nonstationarity has a local profile, varying not only along the learning process but also along different regions of the state space.	0.11159517616033554	High	Semantic Scholar
We propose to deal with these problems using an estimation of the probability density of samples represented with a gaussian mixture model.	0.056888893246650696	High	Semantic Scholar
To deal with the nonstationarity problem, we use the common approach of introducing a forgetting factor in the updating formula.	0.3026536703109741	High	Semantic Scholar
However, instead of using the same forgetting factor for the whole domain, we make it dependent on the local density of samples, which we use to estimate the nonstationarity of the function at any given input point.	0.10840260982513428	High	Semantic Scholar
To address the biased sampling problem, the forgetting factor applied to each mixture component is modulated according to the new information provided in the updating, rather than forgetting depending only on time, thus avoiding undesired distortions of the approximation in less sampled regions.	0.1694997251033783	High	Semantic Scholar
However, traditional dimensionality reduction (DR) methods commonly use the original input features to define the intrinsic structure, which makes the estimated intrinsic structure unreliable since redundant or noisy features may exist in the original input features.	0.04239426180720329	High	Semantic Scholar
Thus a dilemma is that (1) one needs the most suitable feature representation to define the intrinsic structure of data and (2) one should use the proper intrinsic structure of data to perform feature extraction.	0.0997091755270958	High	Semantic Scholar
The structure is learned from the results of feature learning, and the features are learned to preserve the refined structure of data.	0.4217609465122223	High	Semantic Scholar
Notwithstanding the seemingly straightforward nature of the inertial parameter identification problem for multibody systems—the most common formulation is as a linear least-squares estimation problem—existing methods, especially for complex high-dof systems subject to nonpersistent and noisy measurements, tend to be highly sensitive to the choice of initial values, and more often than not converge to ad hoc solutions that lie on arbitrary user-specified boundaries.	0.06449955701828003	High	Semantic Scholar
We argue in this letter that such ill-posed behavior is traceable in large part to the use of the standard Euclidean metric in the regularized least-squares error criterion.	0.0518830306828022	High	Semantic Scholar
We instead make use of the fact that the collection of inertial parameters constitutes a Riemannian manifold with a naturally defined Riemannian metric.	0.08290208876132965	High	Semantic Scholar
