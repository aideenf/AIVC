This paper is concerned with various types of allocation problems in fair division of indivisible goods, aiming at maximin share, proportional share, and minimax share allocations.	0.06122882291674614	High	Semantic Scholar
However, such allocations do not always exist, not even in very simple settings with two or three agents.	0.7787994742393494	High	Semantic Scholar
A natural question is to ask, given a problem instance, what is the largest value c for which there is an allocation such that every agent has utility of at least c times her fair share.	0.2715706527233124	High	Semantic Scholar
We first prove that the decision problem of checking if there exists a minimax share allocation for a given problem instance is $$ \mathrm {NP} $$ NP -hard when the agents ’ utility functions are additive.	0.11597836762666702	High	Semantic Scholar
We then show that, for each of the three fairness notions, one can approximate c by a polynomial-time approximation scheme, assuming that the number of agents is fixed.	0.04570914804935455	High	Semantic Scholar
Next, we investigate the restricted cases when utility functions have values in $$ \ {0,1\} $$ {0,1} only or are defined based on scoring vectors (Borda and lexicographic vectors), and we obtain several tractability results for these cases.	0.13221532106399536	High	Semantic Scholar

RTB enables advertisers to buy individual ad impressions via an auction in real-time and facilitates the evaluation and the bidding of individual impressions across multiple advertisers.	0.22377777099609375	High	Semantic Scholar
In RTB, the advertisers face three main challenges when optimizing their bidding strategies, namely (i) estimating the utility (e.g., conversions, clicks) of the ad impression, (ii) forecasting the market value (thus the cost) of the given ad impression, and (iii) deciding the optimal bid for the given auction based on the first two.	0.04802139103412628	High	Semantic Scholar

Function approximation in online, incremental, reinforcement learning needs to deal with two fundamental problems: biased sampling and nonstationarity.	0.07017812877893448	High	Semantic Scholar

This approach has several advantages with respect to the existing models.	0.40206027030944824	High	Semantic Scholar
First, it takes into account shear and torsional deformations, which are both essential to cope with out-of-plane external loads.	0.08096914738416672	High	Semantic Scholar
Finally, this approach allows to extend to soft manipulators, the recursive composite-rigid-body and articulated-body algorithms, whose performances are compared through a cantilever beam simulation.	0.15495726466178894	High	Semantic Scholar
A mean first passage time (MFPT) definition overcomes much of the arbitrariness and many of the problems associated with the more usual signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) definition.	0.021716274321079254	High	Semantic Scholar
We have previously computed MFPT lifetimes for simple, binary-strength synapses that lack internal, plasticity-related states.	0.33117231726646423	High	Semantic Scholar
Here we extend our earlier work by computing the entire first passage time (FPT) distribution for simple, multistate synapses, from which all statistics, including the MFPT lifetime, may be extracted.	0.1731492578983307	High	Semantic Scholar
For this, we develop a Fokker-Planck equation using the jump moments for perceptron activation.	0.038633815944194794	High	Semantic Scholar
Two models are considered that satisfy a particular eigenvector condition that this approach requires.	0.1856100857257843	High	Semantic Scholar
In these models, MFPT lifetimes do not exhibit optimality conditions, while in one but not the other, SNR lifetimes do exhibit optimality.	0.4119846522808075	High	Semantic Scholar
Thus, not only are such optimality conditions artifacts of the SNR approach, but they are also strongly model dependent.	0.05103899911046028	High	Semantic Scholar
By examining the variance in the FPT distribution, we may identify regions in which memory storage is subject to high variability, although MFPT lifetimes are nevertheless robustly positive.	0.04992036521434784	High	Semantic Scholar
In such regions, SNR lifetimes are typically (defined to be) zero.	0.07344066351652145	High	Semantic Scholar
FPT-defined memory lifetimes therefore provide an analytically superior approach and also have the virtue of being directly related to a neuron's firing properties.	0.03307385370135307	High	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a distributed SVM algorithm in a master-slave mode (MS-DSVM), which integrates a distributed SVM and ADMM acting in a master-slave configuration where the master node and slave nodes are connected, meaning the results can be broadcasted.	0.30902740359306335	High	Semantic Scholar

Ride-sharing (RS) has great values in saving energy and alleviating traffic pressure.	0.021324792876839638	High	Semantic Scholar
Existing studies can be improved for better efficiency.	0.03418699651956558	High	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we propose a new ride-sharing model, where each driver has a requirement that if the driver shares a ride with a rider, the shared route percentage (i.e., the ratio of the shared route's distance to the driver's total travel distance) exceeds an expectation rate of the driver, e.g. , 0.8.	0.07274004071950912	High	Semantic Scholar
The first considers multiple drivers and multiple riders and aims to compute driver-rider pairs to maximize the overall shared route percentage (SRP).	0.06957127898931503	High	Semantic Scholar
We model this problem as the maximum weighted bigraph matching problem, where the vertices are drivers and riders, edges are driver-rider pairs, and edge weights are driver-rider's SRP.	0.06125050410628319	High	Semantic Scholar
However, it is rather expensive to compute the SRP values for large numbers of driver-rider pairs on road networks.	0.023872919380664825	High	Semantic Scholar
The basic idea is that we compute an upper bound and a lower bound for each driver-rider pair in constant time.	0.03160659968852997	High	Semantic Scholar
Then, we estimate an upper bound and a lower bound of the graph matching.	0.23026499152183533	High	Semantic Scholar
Next, we select some driver-rider pairs, compute their real shortest-route distance, and update the lower and upper bounds of the maximum graph matching.	0.026801103726029396	High	Semantic Scholar
We repeat above steps until the ratio of the upper bound to the lower bound is not larger than a given approximate rate.	0.24718663096427917	High	Semantic Scholar
The second considers multiple drivers and a single rider and aims to find the top- <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX"> $k $</tex-math> <alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink: href="li-ieq1-2760880.gif"/> </alternatives> </inline-formula> drivers for the rider with the largest SRP.	0.028991399332880974	High	Semantic Scholar
We first prune a large number of drivers that cannot meet the SRP requirements.	0.09517142176628113	High	Semantic Scholar
Then, we propose a best-first algorithm that progressively selects the drivers with high probability to be in the top- <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX"> $k $</tex-math> <alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink: href="li-ieq2-2760880.gif"/> </alternatives> </inline-formula> results and prunes the drivers that cannot be in the top- <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX"> $k $</tex-math> <alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink: href="li-ieq3-2760880.gif"/> </alternatives> </inline-formula> results.	0.13127931952476501	High	Semantic Scholar
To address this issue, we propose a point pair descriptor that is robust to noise and occlusion and achieves high retrieval accuracy.	0.10389328002929688	High	Semantic Scholar

Anytime almost-surely asymptotically optimal planners, such as RRT*, incrementally find paths to every state in the search domain.	0.05526852235198021	High	Semantic Scholar

In this study, we attempt to evaluate the user preferences for web design attributes (i.e., typography, color, content quality, interactivity, and navigation) to determine the trust, satisfaction, and loyalty for uncertainty avoidance cultures.	0.47770875692367554	High	Semantic Scholar
Content quality and navigation have been observed as strong factors in building user trust with e-commerce websites.	0.04103156924247742	High	Semantic Scholar
In contrast, interactivity, color, and typography have been observed as strong determinants of user satisfaction.	0.02977745421230793	High	Semantic Scholar
The most relevant and interesting finding is related to typography, which has been rarely discussed in e-commerce literature.	0.090069979429245	High	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, all the web design attributes were observed as important design features to develop user trust and satisfaction for uncertainty avoidance cultures.	0.07182326167821884	High	Semantic Scholar
Although both factors seem to be relevant, the relationship between trust and loyalty was observed to be stronger than between satisfaction and loyalty; thus, trust seems to be a stronger determinant of loyalty for risk/high uncertainty avoidance cultures.	0.5409034490585327	High	Semantic Scholar
Policy search (PS) algorithms are widely used for their simplicity and effectiveness in finding solutions for robotic problems.	0.021476032212376595	High	Semantic Scholar
This means that experiments yielding a poor performance are usually discarded or given too little influence on the policy update.	0.23234695196151733	High	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a generalization of the relative entropy policy search (REPS) algorithm that takes bad experiences into consideration when computing a policy.	0.08669871836900711	High	Semantic Scholar
Thus, considering that there is a duality between good and bad data samples, both are taken into account in the stochastic search for a policy.	0.09971531480550766	High	Semantic Scholar
Additionally, a cluster with the best samples may be included as an attractor to enforce faster convergence to a single optimal solution in multimodal problems.	0.11353285610675812	High	Semantic Scholar

With the advances in geo-positioning technologies and location-based services, it is nowadays quite common for road networks to have textual contents on the vertices.	0.03962598368525505	High	Semantic Scholar
However, in many practical scenarios, an optimal route might not always be desirable.	0.07380475848913193	High	Semantic Scholar
For example, a personalized route query is issued by providing some clues that describe the spatial context between PoIs along the route, where the result can be far from the optimal one.	0.022480595856904984	High	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the problem of clue-based route search (< inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX"> ${\sf {CRS} } $</tex-math> <alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink: href="zheng-ieq1-2703848.gif"/> </alternatives> </inline-formula> ), which allows a user to provide clues on keywords and spatial relationships.	0.022429857403039932	High	Semantic Scholar

In this letter, we study the confounder detection problem in the linear model, where the target variable Y is predicted using its n potential causes Xn= (x1, …, xn) T. Based on an assumption of a rotation-invariant generating process of the model, recent study shows that the spectral measure induced by the regression coefficient vector with respect to the covariance matrix of Xn is close to a uniform measure in purely causal cases, but it differs from a uniform measure characteristically in the presence of a scalar confounder.	0.03439471125602722	High	Semantic Scholar
Analyzing spectral measure patterns could help to detect confounding.	0.028571469709277153	High	Semantic Scholar
We calculate the first moment of the regression vector–induced spectral measure and compare it with the first moment of a uniform spectral measure, both defined with respect to the covariance matrix of Xn.	0.2055492401123047	High	Semantic Scholar
The two moments coincide in nonconfounding cases and differ from each other in the presence of confounding.	0.19814635813236237	High	Semantic Scholar

This study shows how learning relations between affordances facilitates performing robotic tasks.	0.22621184587478638	High	Semantic Scholar
Tasks usually involve multiple affordances.	0.04219597950577736	High	Semantic Scholar
For example, for pounding a nail with a hammer, grasp-ability and pound-ability of the hammer are important for performing the pounding task successfully.	0.029516562819480896	High	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, these affordances are associated with parts of the hammer.	0.08940332382917404	High	Semantic Scholar
In the pounding task, the head of the hammer affords pounding and the handle of the hammer affords grasping.	0.05334755405783653	High	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, affordances are linked to object parts.	0.13126683235168457	High	Semantic Scholar
We learn affordances associated with manipulation and execution of the tasks, i.e., grasping for manipulation and pounding for execution in the task of pounding a nail.	0.808753490447998	High	Semantic Scholar

In this letter, a sparse Markov decision process (MDP) with novel causal sparse Tsallis entropy regularization is proposed.	0.027732545509934425	High	Semantic Scholar
We first analyze the optimality condition of a sparse MDP.	0.734533429145813	High	Semantic Scholar
Then, we propose a sparse value iteration method that solves a sparse MDP and then prove the convergence and optimality of sparse value iteration using the Banach fixed-point theorem.	0.028129812330007553	High	Semantic Scholar
The proposed sparse MDP is compared to soft MDPs that utilize causal entropy regularization.	0.023432085290551186	High	Semantic Scholar
We show that the performance error of a sparse MDP has a constant bound, while the error of a soft MDP increases logarithmically with respect to the number of actions, where this performance error is caused by the introduced regularization term.	0.08816509693861008	High	Semantic Scholar
In experiments, we apply sparse MDPs to reinforcement learning problems.	0.5606698393821716	High	Semantic Scholar
However, the labelling of the training set is time-consuming, especially as datasets grow in size and complexity.	0.08228360861539841	High	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, this approach is not applicable to the home user, who wants to intuitively group their media without tirelessly labelling the content.	0.42910823225975037	High	Semantic Scholar
We efficiently compute metric distances between signatures despite their inherent high dimensionality and provide discriminative feature selection, to allow common and distinctive elements to be identified from a small set of user labelled examples.	0.6799189448356628	High	Semantic Scholar
These elements are then accentuated in the image signature to increase similarity between examples and pull correct classes together.	0.10321056842803955	High	Semantic Scholar
To demonstrate that the approach is agnostic to media type and features used, we evaluate on three image datasets (15 scene, Caltech101 and FG-NET), a mixed text and image dataset (ImageTag), a dataset used in active learning (Iris) and on three action recognition datasets (UCF11, KTH and Hollywood2).	0.04129265621304512	High	Semantic Scholar

Hangya, Sanders, and Kepecs (2016) have proposed that researchers can test the Bayesian model by deriving qualitative signatures of Bayesian confidence (i.e., patterns that one would expect to see if an observer were Bayesian) and looking for those signatures in human or animal data.	0.063876211643219	High	Semantic Scholar
We examine two proposed signatures, showing that their derivations contain hidden assumptions that limit their applicability and that they are neither necessary nor sufficient conditions for Bayesian confidence.	0.025163162499666214	High	Semantic Scholar

One prominent view is that this type of synchrony facilitates the binding or grouping of separate stimulus components.	0.08877468854188919	High	Semantic Scholar
This choice is grounded on the fact that any manipulative action requires to instruct the robot where to grasp, and most garment handling activities depend on the correct recognition of the type to which the particular cloth item belongs and its state.	0.3946249186992645	High	Semantic Scholar
Unfortunately, existing query authentication techniques either do not work for set-valued data or they lack data confidentiality.	0.05142195522785187	High	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose authenticated aggregate queries over set-valued data that not only ensure the integrity of query results but also preserve the confidentiality of source data.	0.3954618275165558	High	Semantic Scholar
As many aggregate queries are composed of multiset operations such as set union and subset, we first develop a family of privacy-preserving authentication protocols for primitive multiset operations.	0.22934547066688538	High	Semantic Scholar
Carrying its own weight while countering forces may be too much for a robot in certain configurations.	0.21463972330093384	High	Semantic Scholar
It may be impossible to withstand a physical interaction in some configurations, while it may be easily sustainable in others that bring the end-effector to the same location.	0.7570244669914246	High	Semantic Scholar
This becomes obviously more prevalent for a limited payload robot.	0.6387061476707458	High	Semantic Scholar
This letter describes a framework for these kind of operations, in which kinematic redundancy is used to explore the full extent of a force capacity for a given manipulator and task (in this letter, the terms “ force ” and “ wrench ” may interchangeably refer to two-, three-, or six-dimensional forces depending on the dimension of the problem and on whether they may or may not include components of translational forces and/or moments.	0.06844320148229599	High	Semantic Scholar
Their dimensional definition will be explicitly given whenever specifically needed).	0.18315280973911285	High	Semantic Scholar
We propose a coupled convolution layer comprising multiple parallel convolutions with mutually constrained filters.	0.2557021677494049	High	Semantic Scholar
Function approximation in online, incremental, reinforcement learning needs to deal with two fundamental problems: biased sampling and nonstationarity.	0.07017812877893448	High	Semantic Scholar
However, instead of using the same forgetting factor for the whole domain, we make it dependent on the local density of samples, which we use to estimate the nonstationarity of the function at any given input point.	0.04714556038379669	High	Semantic Scholar
To address the biased sampling problem, the forgetting factor applied to each mixture component is modulated according to the new information provided in the updating, rather than forgetting depending only on time, thus avoiding undesired distortions of the approximation in less sampled regions.	0.11377089470624924	High	Semantic Scholar
A suitable feature representation can faithfully preserve the intrinsic structure of data.	0.17425455152988434	High	Semantic Scholar
Thus a dilemma is that (1) one needs the most suitable feature representation to define the intrinsic structure of data and (2) one should use the proper intrinsic structure of data to perform feature extraction.	0.02733379602432251	High	Semantic Scholar
Notwithstanding the seemingly straightforward nature of the inertial parameter identification problem for multibody systems—the most common formulation is as a linear least-squares estimation problem—existing methods, especially for complex high-dof systems subject to nonpersistent and noisy measurements, tend to be highly sensitive to the choice of initial values, and more often than not converge to ad hoc solutions that lie on arbitrary user-specified boundaries.	0.2011203169822693	High	Semantic Scholar
We argue in this letter that such ill-posed behavior is traceable in large part to the use of the standard Euclidean metric in the regularized least-squares error criterion.	0.1164969801902771	High	Semantic Scholar
Experiments involving high-dof humanoid structures are presented to validate our method and claims.	0.21079474687576294	High	Semantic Scholar
