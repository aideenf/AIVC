the curriculum is designed as follows - intro cs for students to try out cs and see if it s right for them- core cs corresponds roughly to the first three years of a computer science curriculum, taking classes that all majors would be required to take- advanced cs corresponds roughly to the final year of a computer science curriculum, taking electives according to the student s interests- final project a project for students to validate, consolidate, and display their knowledge, to be evaluated by their peers worldwide- pro cs graduate-level specializations students can elect to take after completing the above curriculum if they want to maximize their chances of getting a good jobduration.	0.0002689268148969859	Low	Github_non_AI

b toxy hackable http proxy to simulate server failure scenarios, systems resiliency testing and unexpected network conditions, built for node.js.it was mainly designed for failure resistance testing, when toxy becomes particularly useful in order to cover fault tolerance and resiliency capabilities of a system, especially in disruption-tolerant networks and service-oriented architectures, where toxy may act as mitm proxy among services in order to inject failure.toxy allows you to plug in poisons, optionally filtered by rules, which essentially can intercept and alter the http flow as you need, performing multiple evil actions in the middle of that process, such as limiting the bandwidth, delaying network packets, injecting network jitter latency or replying with a custom error or status code.it primarily operates at l7, although it can simulate l3 network conditions.toxy can be fluently used programmatically or via http api.it was built on top of rocky, a full-featured middleware-oriented http proxy, and it s also pluggable in connect express as standard middleware.requires node.js 4. contents- features- introduction - why toxy - concepts - how it works- usage - installation - examples- benchmark- poisons - poisoning scopes - poisoning phases - built-in poisons - latency - inject response - bandwidth - rate limit - slow read - slow open - slow close - throttle - abort connection - timeout - how to write poisons- rules - built-in rules - probability - time threshold - method - content type - headers - response headers - body - response body - response status - third-party rules - how to write rules- programmatic api- http api - usage - authorization - api - programmatic api- license features- full-featured http s proxy backed by rocky and http-proxy - hackable and elegant programmatic api inspired on connect express - admin http api for external management and dynamic configuration- featured built-in router with nested configuration- hierarchical and composable poisoning with rule based filtering- hierarchical middleware layer both global and route scopes - easily augmentable via middleware based on connect express middleware - supports both incoming and outgoing traffic poisoning- built-in poisons bandwidth, error, abort, latency, slow read... - rule-based poisoning probabilistic, http method, headers, body... - supports third-party poisons and rules- built-in balancer and traffic interceptor via middleware- inherits api and features from rocky- compatible with connect express and most of their middleware - able to run as standalone http proxy introduction why toxy there re some other similar solutions like toxy in the market, but most of them do not provide a proper programmatic control and usually are not easy to hack, configure or are directly closed to extensibility.furthermore, the majority of those solutions only operates at tcp l3 level stack instead of providing high-level abstractions to cover common requirements in the specific domain and nature of the http l7 protocol, like toxy tries to providetoxy brings a powerful hackable and extensible solution with a convenient abstraction, but without losing a proper low-level interface capabilities to deal with http protocol primitives easily.toxy was designed based on the rules of composition, simplicity and extensibility.via its built-in hierarchical domain specific middleware layer you can easily augment toxy features to your own needs.	0.009750844910740852	Low	Github_non_AI

detailed tutorialxprivacy starts in the main view, where a data category can be selected at the top.by ticking one or more check boxes in the list below, you can restrict the selected data category for the chosen applications.the default category is all, meaning that all data categories will be restricted.tapping on an application icon shows the detailed view where you can manage each of the data categories for the selected application.this view will also appear when you tap on the notification that appears after installing or updating an application.by default, all data categories will be restricted for newly installed applications to prevent leaking privacy-sensitive data.you can change which data categories will be restricted by changing the template available from the main menu.data categories make it easier to manage restrictions.you can drill down the data categories in the detailed view to reveal individual functions.if the category is restricted, you can un-restrict individual functions by clearing the function s check box.to see restrictions in action, try restricting the category identification forandroid id info.applying some restrictions requires restarting applications.you can turn on and off all restrictions for an application using the on off toggle switch.since version 1.99, you can also restrict on demand.this means you will be asked to allow or deny a category functionwhen the category function is used by an application.restricting on demand is the default for newly installed applications when using the default template .you can turn on and off restricting on demand in the application details viewusing either the settings or the check box to the right of the on off toggle switch.you can turn on and off restricting on demand for individual categories and functionsusing the second column of check boxes.if an application has requested android permissions for a data category,the category will be marked with a green key icon.if an application has used or tried to use data, the data category will be marked with an orange warning triangle icon.if an application has internet permissions, a world globe icon will be shown to the left of the application name.these icons are just guidelines because an application can still access some privacy-sensitive data without android permissions,such as your device s serial number, and because it is not possible to monitor data usage in each and every situation,such as access to the internet or external storage.be aware that an application can still access the internet through other sister applications.restricting internet or storage means blocking access to the internet and to external storage typically the sd-card , respectively.either of these may result in error messages and even cause applications to force close crash .function restrictions considered dangerous are marked with a reddish background color.these dangerous functions are more likely to cause applications to crash if you restrict them.	0.0007236855453811586	Low	Github_non_AI

b go versioning packager gvp stands for go versioning packager and is based on gst gst a similar tool that provides dependency isolation for ruby gems.the tool modifies your gopath to point to a local .godeps directory so that you can keep the dependencies of your project isolated there, it also modifies gobin and path to include the new gopath bin directory.gvp is a companion tool to gpm gpm but both tools can be used independently from each other.	0.0010952678276225924	Low	Github_non_AI
gvp in the function that is called when executing source gvp gvp out return the prompt to normal using with autoenv autoenv simply run cd path to projecttouch .envecho source path to gvp .env pluginsas of v0.1.0 v0.1.0 gvp includes a plugin system very much similar to the one in gpm gpm-plugins .the way gvp plugin work is simple whenever an unknown command is passed into gvp it will look for an executable in your path called gvp- and if it exists it will run it while passing all extra arguments to it, simple yet powerful.this brings a lot to the table plugins can be written in anything, they can be go binaries, bash scripts, ruby gems, python packages, you name it.	0.00027536365087144077	Low	Github_non_AI
why dependencies of multiple go projects are by far easier to handle in isolation, using plain gpm gpm to handle your dependencies means that you are forced to run it again every time you work on a new project, this can get oldquickly.using gvp can greatly simplify your workflow, by isolating your go project dependencies you only need to run source gvpin order to be back in the work environment of your application, this means that there will never be go packages installed inyour system which will conflict in versioning across your different projects.if for some reason you need to ship your repository with its dependencies included this is also of help, but including agodeps file to use with gpm will probably be your best option.	0.037880782037973404	Low	Github_non_AI

i did this for walled in which gave the program much better performance than it otherwise would have had.the while getch err waits for any key press and then ends the program if it gets one.important to this strategy is using structs to hold your data, this allows you to keep the printing and logic separate - just pass the address a pointer of the game data struct s around and manipulate read them for logic printing.for this project my print function looked like this void printwindow window w for int i 0 i w- numballs i attron color pair w- balls i .colorpair applying the ball s color mvprintw w- balls i .y, w- balls i .x, w- balls i .avatar attroff color pair w- balls i .colorpair stop printing in this color and here are the structs typedef struct ball position double x double y how we display the ball char avatar speed what we add to the x and y each loop iteration double speedx double speedy int colorpair ball typedef struct window int height int width int sleeptime int numballs ball balls window conclusionhopefully this guide successfully illustrated how to make games for the terminal, and good strategy for constructing them.	4.814339627046138e-05	Low	Github_non_AI

as this matrix may be very large, we may use a random projection to replace this matrix with a narrower matrix.once this step is complete, we no longer need the original documents.find anchor words .in this step we select k words, one per topic, that will be anchors .	2.673065864655655e-05	Low	Github_non_AI
the size of the corpus matters, but it only affects the initial co-occurrence-finding step and the doc-topic step, if used.as a result, we can use the spectral algorithm on very large corpora.random projections for large vocabularies.we use random projections to allow for large vocabularies without running out of memory.the word co-occurrence matrix that we calculate from the documents requires memory proportional to the square of the number of distinct words.if we want to use vocabularies larger than about 4000 words, we need to find a way to compress this matrix.a random projection is a way of representing high dimensional points in a lower dimensional space, such that distances are preserved.instead of a square matrix, we create a tall skinny matrix.the command line parameter num-random-projections determines the number of columns in the resulting matrix.	0.0056534712202847	Low	Github_non_AI
based on some initial experiments, around 1000 random projections seems to be a good number, but this should be used only as a rough estimate.a second parameter of the random projections is the density of the random projection.	0.039464231580495834	Low	Github_non_AI
the random projection step means that the algorithm is not strictly deterministic, but if you use enough random projections, the resulting model should not change significantly from run to run.the vocabulary and the anchor words.in most cases we want to consider a subset of the vocabulary as possible anchor words.the algorithm looks for words that occur only in the context of a single topic.	5.695145227946341e-05	Low	Github_non_AI

here s why currently for passing custom objects in between activities either we have to implement parcellable or serialization which not only justs adds un-necessary work to add extra code and moreover adds both performance and memory hit, which is defintely not a good way to go some developers use third party libraries like greendao s eventbus, i am great fan of eventbus too but using it in this scenario is not correct for two reasons 1- it keeps a strong reference to the object which can lead to various memory leaks2- it exposes the object to be picked up by any other class, resulting in a mess.if you just want to pass custom objects within same process than asfobjectstore is quite flexible and handy.usagenote you can either create a new instance of asfobectstore for dependency injection any other reason or just use the global instance by using getdefault method.suppose we have a custom object named myobject which is a field of abcactivity and we want to pass it to xyzactivity in abcactivity we can push a weak reference safely here because myoject is being retained by sender activity we could also call the method pushstrong to make the object retained at all costs until it gets popped string myobjectkey asfobjectstore.getdefault .pushweak myobject intent.putextra xyzactivity.extra my object key, myobjectkey in xyzactivitystring myobjectkey getintent .getstringextra extra my object key single method pop , for both pushweak and pushstrong myobject asfobjectstore.getdefault .pop myobjectkey if you are creating a new instance of asfobjectstore and want to pass in objects of a specific type, then you can benefit from templating like this asfobjectstore mystringsstore new asfobjectstore installationlightweight and easy to use, just a single file asfobjectstore.java of size 3kbeclipse- download and include asfobjectstore.javagradle- use above method for now, in process of uploading it to maven centralauthorasif mujteba, asifmujteba gmail.comtwitter asifmujtebalicensethis library is available under the mit license.	0.0009295045165345073	Low	Github_non_AI

you can use the successor xprivacylua on android 6.0 marshmallow and later.publicationindex description features screenshots restrictions limitations compatibility installation upgrading usage permissions frequently asked questions faq support changelog similar solutions in the media contributing licensedescriptionxprivacy can prevent applications from leaking privacy-sensitive databy restricting the categories of data an application can access.xprivacy feeds applications fake data or no data at all.it can restrict several data categories, such as contacts or location.for example, if you restrict an application s access to contacts,that application will receive an empty contacts list don t try this with the contacts application itself without a backup .similarly, restricting an application s access to your location will send a fake location to that application.xprivacy doesn t revoke or block permissions from an application,so most applications will continue to work as before and won t force close crash .there are two exceptions access to the internet and to external storage typically an sd-card are restricted by denying access revoking permissions .there is no other way to restrict such accessbecause android delegates handling these permissions to the underlying linux network file system.xprivacy can fake an offline internet and unmounted storage state,but some applications still try to access the internet and storage,potentially resulting in crashes or error messages.if restricting a category of data for an application causes functional limitations,xprivacy can once again allow access to the data category to solve the issue.there is a convenient on off toggle switch for all restrictions for each application.by default, all newly installed applications cannot access any data category,which prevents a new application from leaking sensitive data right after installing it.shortly after installing a new application,xprivacy will ask which data categories you want the new application to have access to.xprivacy comes with an application browserthat allows you to quickly enable or disable applications access to any data category.you can edit all of an application s data categories.to help you identify potential data leaks,xprivacy monitors all applications attempts to access sensitive data.xprivacy displays an orange warning triangle icon when an application has attempted to access data.if an application has requested android permissions to access data, xprivacy displays a green key icon.xprivacy also displays an internet icon if an application has internet access,which clarifies that the application poses a risk of sharing data with an external server.xprivacy is built using the xposed framework,which it uses to tap into a vast number of carefully selected android functions.depending on the function, xprivacy skips execution of the original function for example, when an application tries to set a proximity alert or alters the result of the original function for example, to return an empty message list .xprivacy has been tested with android version 4.0.3 - 6.0.1 ice cream sandwich, jelly bean, kitkat, lollipop, marshmallow ,and is reported to work with most android variants, including stock roms.root access is needed to install the xposed framework.xprivacy was a lot of work, so please support this project.if you want to donate, see here for all options.use xprivacy entirely at your own risk.features simple to use no need to patch anything no source, no smali or anything else for any stock variant of android version 4.0.3 - 6.0.1 ics, jelly bean, kitkat, lollipop, marshmallow newly installed applications are restricted by default displays data actually used by an application option to

as piwik analytics tracks the ecommerce items being purchased with each order or transaction, the predicted purchase horizon may also be combined with association rule mining see below to recommend products or services for time delayed cross-selling.in this project, we use personalized markov models to predict when a customer is likely to make the next purchase.the idea behind this approach is to aggregate customer transaction data into discrete well-defined states.	0.9904404878616333	High	Github_non_AI
identifying customers with a downward loyalty curve with such analysis can directly trigger proactive actions to resurrect the relationships of these customers.customer loyalty prediction is based on the functionality of the spark-hmm https github.com skrusche63 scala-hmm project.as in predicting the purchase horizon, the folowing states are used to aggregate a customer transaction the time elapsed since the last transaction,small s , medium m and large l , and the amount spent compared to the last one,less l , about same s and more m .	0.8902149200439453	High	Github_non_AI
