But real neurons in the brain are different from most of these artificial ones in at least three crucial ways: they emit spikes rather than graded outputs, their inputs and outputs are related dynamically rather than by piecewise-smooth functions, and they have no known way to coordinate arrays of synapses in separate forward and feedback pathways so that they change simultaneously and identically, as they do in backpropagation.	0.3489880859851837	High	Semantic Scholar
Given these differences, it is unlikely that current deep learning algorithms can operate in the brain, but we that show these problems can be solved by two simple devices: learning rules can approximate dynamic input-output relations with piecewise-smooth functions, and a variation on the feedback alignment algorithm can train deep networks without having to coordinate forward and feedback synapses.	0.06114543601870537	High	Semantic Scholar

To deal with these issues, we address Biased Dropout and Crossmap Dropout, two novel approaches of Dropout extension based on the behavior of hidden units in CNN model.	0.37337857484817505	High	Semantic Scholar
The second approach is Crossmap Dropout, which is an extension of the regular Dropout in convolution layer.	0.047020718455314636	High	Semantic Scholar

Crossmap Dropout tries to maintain this important correlation yet at the same time break the correlation between each adjacent pixel with respect to all feature maps by applying the same Dropout mask to all feature maps, so that all pixels or units in equivalent positions in each feature map will be either dropped or active during training.	0.21245495975017548	High	Semantic Scholar

Firstly, as samples of surface, a point cloud acquired by laser scanner, which normally works in a spherical fashion, has very limited density when the surface is far away from the laser scanner and the density varies a lot at different ranges.	0.15395992994308472	High	Semantic Scholar
Current registration methods cannot accurately model the surface uncertainty for such kind of point clouds of limited and large varying density.	0.12178511172533035	High	Semantic Scholar
Secondly, when the point cloud is acquired while the platform is simultaneously moving, the estimation error of the platform motion makes the acquired point cloud distorted.	0.17787742614746094	High	Semantic Scholar
To deal with these problems, in this paper, we propose an uncertainty model based on the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to represent the point cloud.	0.06077423319220543	High	Semantic Scholar

Given crowds map query logs, our proposed HCAR-NN not only learns the local temporal correlation among map queries in a query session (e.g., queries in a short-term interval are relevant to accomplish a search mission), but also captures the global longer range contextual dependencies among map query sessions in query logs (e.g., how a sequence of queries within a short-term interval has an influence on another sequence of queries).	0.041332636028528214	High	Semantic Scholar

However, the solution quality is closely related to the timing for starting value propagation in Max-sum_ADVP.	0.055630702525377274	High	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we prove that value propagation could restrict the exploration ability brought by Max-sum and eventually makes Max-sum_ADVP equivalent to a sequential greedy local search algorithm.	0.0423087477684021	High	Semantic Scholar
For getting a balance between exploration and exploitation, several non-consecutive value propagation strategies are proposed to relax the restriction caused by value propagation: single-side value propagation which executes value propagation and Max-sum_AD in an interleaved way, probabilistic value propagation which performs value propagation stochastically and hybrid belief/value propagation where agents perform Max-sum_AD and value propagation in one round.	0.05564652010798454	High	Semantic Scholar

In this paper, we firstly propose a novel density-based algorithm PDBSCAN, which improves the previous FDBSCAN from the following aspects: (1) it employs a more accurate method to compute the probability that the distance between two uncertain objects is less than or equal to a boundary value, instead of the sampling-based method in FDBSCAN; (2) it introduces new definitions of probability neighborhood, support degree, core object probability, direct reachability probability, thus reducing the complexity and solving the issue of nonadaptive threshold (for core object judgement) in FDBSCAN.	0.8578839302062988	High	Semantic Scholar

We explore whether the DNN neurons (units in DNNs) possess image object representational statistics similar to monkey IT neurons, particularly when the network becomes deeper and the number of image categories becomes larger, using VGG19, a typical and widely used deep network of 19 layers in the computer vision field.	0.40342092514038086	High	Semantic Scholar
Following Lehky, Kiani, Esteky, and Tanaka (2011 , 2014), where the response statistics of 674 IT neurons to 806 image stimuli are analyzed using three measures (kurtosis, Pareto tail index, and intrinsic dimensionality), we investigate the three issues in this letter using the same three measures: (1) the similarities and differences of the neural response statistics between VGG19 and primate IT cortex, (2) the variation trends of the response statistics of VGG19 neurons at different layers from low to high, and (3) the variation trends of the response statistics of VGG19 neurons when the numbers of stimuli and neurons increase.	0.4416562616825104	High	Semantic Scholar
We find that the response statistics on both single-neuron selectivity and population sparseness of VGG19 neurons are fundamentally different from those of IT neurons in most cases; by increasing the number of neurons in different layers and the number of stimuli, the response statistics of neurons at different layers from low to high do not substantially change; and the estimated intrinsic dimensionality values at the low convolutional layers of VGG19 are considerably larger than the value of approximately 100 reported for IT neurons in Lehky et al.	0.2880926728248596	High	Semantic Scholar

In this paper we discuss the peculiarity of this kind of 0-1 MILP models, and describe an effective bound-tightening technique intended to ease its solution.	0.1430961936712265	High	Semantic Scholar
We also present possible applications of the 0-1 MILP model arising in feature visualization and in the construction of adversarial examples.	0.1516752541065216	High	Semantic Scholar
Both approaches, namely elastic structure preserving (ESP) and ESP+, have in common that they preserve the link-side inertial properties and the elastic structure of the original plant dynamics, hence the name ESP control.	0.041002459824085236	High	Semantic Scholar
Apart from that, ESP control focuses on preserving the inertial properties of motor dynamics.	0.21923378109931946	High	Semantic Scholar
While ESP+ control aims at minimizing the dynamic shaping on the motor side.	0.10342912375926971	High	Semantic Scholar
As an alternative to the conventional time-domain methods, the proposed approach eliminates the approximate nature of network validation using an excess of unseen data.	0.1496812254190445	High	Semantic Scholar
The benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated using two numerical examples, where two trained networks performed similarly on the training and the validation data sets, yet they revealed a significant difference in prediction accuracy when tested using a different data set.	0.09743823856115341	High	Semantic Scholar
The efficiency of the proposed approach is further demonstrated on a real-world problem, where unlike other initialization methods, a more conclusive assessment of generalization is achieved.	0.08917327225208282	High	Semantic Scholar
Most traditional spectral clustering algorithms comprise two independent stages (e.g., first learning continuous labels and then rounding the learned labels into discrete ones), which may cause unpredictable deviation of resultant cluster labels from genuine ones, thereby leading to severe information loss and performance degradation.	0.9222056865692139	High	Semantic Scholar
We propose a novel spectral clustering scheme which deeply explores cluster label properties, including discreteness, nonnegativity, and discrimination, as well as learns robust out-of-sample prediction functions.	0.28748539090156555	High	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, we explicitly enforce a discrete transformation on the intermediate continuous labels, which leads to a tractable optimization problem with a discrete solution.	0.06023337319493294	High	Semantic Scholar
Besides, we preserve the natural nonnegative characteristic of the clustering labels to enhance the interpretability of the results.	0.05015198513865471	High	Semantic Scholar
We also show that the out-of-sample component can inject discriminative knowledge into the learning of cluster labels under certain conditions.	0.4918428659439087	High	Semantic Scholar
Chromatically perceptive observers are endowed with a sense of similarity between colors.	0.8996084928512573	High	Semantic Scholar
For example, two shades of green that are only slightly discriminable are perceived as similar, whereas other pairs of colors, for example, blue and yellow, typically elicit markedly different sensations.	0.5901538133621216	High	Semantic Scholar
The notion of similarity need not be shared by different observers.	0.5897670388221741	High	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, there is ample evidence that different animal species sense colors diversely.	0.18425939977169037	High	Semantic Scholar
To capture the subjective metric of color perception, here we construct a notion of distance in color space based on the physiology of the retina, and is thereby individually tailored for different observers.	0.45773664116859436	High	Semantic Scholar
By applying the Fisher metric to an analytical model of color representation, we construct a notion of distance that reproduces behavioral experiments of classical discrimination tasks.	0.6844402551651001	High	Semantic Scholar
We then derive a coordinate transformation that defines a new chromatic space in which the Euclidean distance between any two colors is equal to the perceptual distance, as seen by one individual subject, endowed with an arbitrary number of color-sensitive photoreceptors, each with arbitrary absorption probability curves and appearing in arbitrary proportions.	0.6460222601890564	High	Semantic Scholar
Three challenges arise in modeling and planning: the physics involved is nontrivial, the tail is underactuated, and motions of the object are nondeterministic.	0.04340901970863342	High	Semantic Scholar
Experiments show that a robot with a passive tail can manipulate cylindrical objects with (quasi-static) dragging, dynamic striking motions, and combinations thereof.	0.11405359208583832	High	Semantic Scholar
The method produces solutions that suit diverse preferences effectively, and we analyze the complementary nature of dynamic and quasi-static motions, showing that there exist regimes where transitions between the two are indeed desirable, as reflected in the plans produced.	0.29888564348220825	High	Semantic Scholar
Many recent generative models make use of neural networks to transform the probability distribution of a simple low-dimensional noise process into the complex distribution of the data.	0.2795080542564392	High	Semantic Scholar
This raises the question of whether biological networks operate along similar principles to implement a probabilistic model of the environment through transformations of intrinsic noise processes.	0.12370193004608154	High	Semantic Scholar
This, together with the discrete nature of spikes and local circuit interactions among the neurons, raises several difficulties when using recent generative modeling frameworks to train biologically motivated models.	0.07921606302261353	High	Semantic Scholar
This allows us to use the proposed networks in a variational learning setting where stochastic backpropagation is used to optimize a lower bound on the data log likelihood, thereby learning a generative model of the data.	0.11540824174880981	High	Semantic Scholar
We illustrate the generality of the proposed networks and learning technique by using them in a structured output prediction task and a semisupervised learning task.	0.055632688105106354	High	Semantic Scholar

As a task-specific example, two parsimonious driver steering models of this nature are developed and tested on a dataset of real and simulated driving in near-limit, low-friction circumstances, indicating a clear preference of one model over the other.	0.43998032808303833	High	Semantic Scholar
Some recurring patterns between the two studied tasks are noted in how the model's parameters, fitted to human steering, are affected by the presence or absence of steering torques and motion cues in the simulator.	0.19883857667446136	High	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a multi-manifold regularized non-negative matrix factorization framework (MMNMF) which can preserve the locally geometrical structure of the manifolds for multi-view clustering.	0.26169276237487793	High	Semantic Scholar
We use two methods to construct the consensus manifold and two methods to find the consensus coefficient matrix, which leads to four instances of the framework.	0.1333446055650711	High	Semantic Scholar

Specifically, our method uses the self-expressiveness of the features to represent each feature by other features for preserving the local structure of features, and a low-rank constraint on the weight matrix to preserve the global structure among samples as well as features.	0.05251200497150421	High	Semantic Scholar
Our method also proposes to learn the graph matrix measuring the similarity of samples for preserving the local structure among samples.	0.10151494294404984	High	Semantic Scholar

To achieve such a highly precise control, especially under vacuum, novel control algorithms such as intelligent section control are applied to minimize abrupt changes in the activation of electromagnets as the carrier moves, and command shaping algorithms are applied to prevent excitation of the resonance mode of the system while at a higher control bandwidth.	0.23697757720947266	High	Semantic Scholar
One prominent view is that this type of synchrony facilitates the binding or grouping of separate stimulus components.	0.0850779265165329	High	Semantic Scholar
Given the ubiquity of small, strongly excitatory subnetworks in cortex, we thus propose that many experimental observations of spike synchrony can be viewed as signs of input patterns that resemble long-term experience—that is, of patterns with high prior probability.	0.959558367729187	High	Semantic Scholar

Kinematic redundancy with regard to a task allows a robot to perform it in a continuous space of articular configurations; space in which the payload of the robot may vary dramatically.	0.5090398192405701	High	Semantic Scholar

Experimental comparisons demonstrate that the proposed coupled convolution layer performs slightly better than the original layer while decreasing the number of parameters.	0.0416087880730629	High	Semantic Scholar
In this kind of task, biased sampling occurs because samples are obtained from specific trajectories dictated by the dynamics of the environment and are usually concentrated in particular convergence regions, which in the long term tend to dominate the approximation in the less sampled regions.	0.12345012277364731	High	Semantic Scholar
The nonstationarity comes from the recursive nature of the estimations typical of temporal difference methods.	0.9866217970848083	High	Semantic Scholar
However, instead of using the same forgetting factor for the whole domain, we make it dependent on the local density of samples, which we use to estimate the nonstationarity of the function at any given input point.	0.06206836923956871	High	Semantic Scholar
However, traditional dimensionality reduction (DR) methods commonly use the original input features to define the intrinsic structure, which makes the estimated intrinsic structure unreliable since redundant or noisy features may exist in the original input features.	0.04608875885605812	High	Semantic Scholar
To address the problem, in this paper we propose a unified learning framework to simultaneously obtain the optimal feature representation and intrinsic structure of data.	0.0547867976129055	High	Semantic Scholar

Notwithstanding the seemingly straightforward nature of the inertial parameter identification problem for multibody systems—the most common formulation is as a linear least-squares estimation problem—existing methods, especially for complex high-dof systems subject to nonpersistent and noisy measurements, tend to be highly sensitive to the choice of initial values, and more often than not converge to ad hoc solutions that lie on arbitrary user-specified boundaries.	0.044067319482564926	High	Semantic Scholar
