The new model, which adds clock-based torque control on the leg orientation of the previously developed R-SLIP model, has two advantages: first, regulating the model to follow its passive dynamic running (i.e., at a fixed point) significantly increases the model's basin of attraction; and second, formulating the model closer to the empirical robot enables the model to serve as the transient and steady-state running template of the robot as the anchor.	0.07787411659955978	Medium	Semantic Scholar

Multi-label classifiers usually need to address many issues including: handling large-scale datasets with many instances and a large set of labels, compensating missing label assignments in the training set, considering correlations between labels, as well as exploiting unlabeled data to improve prediction performance.	0.05319401994347572	Medium	Semantic Scholar

To address the biased sampling problem, the forgetting factor applied to each mixture component is modulated according to the new information provided in the updating, rather than forgetting depending only on time, thus avoiding undesired distortions of the approximation in less sampled regions.	0.07696890085935593	Medium	Semantic Scholar

Here, we introduce a dynamic neural field (DNF) model that captures intermediate transposition effects while using neural mechanisms closely resembling those of Spence's original proposal.	0.028063535690307617	Medium	Semantic Scholar

We have previously computed MFPT lifetimes for simple, binary-strength synapses that lack internal, plasticity-related states.	0.031293317675590515	Medium	Semantic Scholar
In simulation we have also seen that for multistate synapses, optimality conditions based on SNR lifetimes are absent with MFPT lifetimes, suggesting that such conditions may be artifactual.	0.02678075060248375	Medium	Semantic Scholar

Depending on values of D, population-averaged values of saturated synaptic inhibition strengths are potentiated [long-term potentiation (LTP) ] or depressed [long-term depression (LTD) ] in comparison with the initial mean value, and dispersions from the mean values of LTP/LTD are much increased when compared with the initial dispersion, independently of D. In most cases of LTD where the effect of mean LTD is dominant in comparison with the effect of dispersion, good synchronization (with higher spiking measure) is found to get better via LTD, while bad synchronization (with lower spiking measure) is found to get worse via LTP.	0.2666265368461609	High	Semantic Scholar

There has been growing interest on agents that represent people ’ s interests or act on their behalf such as automated negotiators, self-driving cars, or drones.	0.41743624210357666	High	Semantic Scholar

This letter uses a depth-dependent reduced-order three-dimensional (3-D) nonholonomic model of needle tip motion to propose a needle deflection controller that works in a surgeon-in-the-loop fashion, where the surgeon is in charge of needle insertion, and the feedback controller is responsible for keeping the needle on its desired trajectory.	0.37667518854141235	High	Semantic Scholar

Evidence is mounting that such synchronicity is not merely caused by properties of the underlying neuronal network but could also depend on the integrity of gap junctions that connect neurons and astrocytes in networks too.	0.19370858371257782	High	Semantic Scholar
In particular, we focus on the fact that astrocytes are rich of GABA transporters (GATs) which can either uptake or release GABA depending on the astrocyte membrane potential, which is a function of local neural activity.	0.4009506404399872	High	Semantic Scholar

However, these works ignore the temporal interactions between answers (how previous answers influence the late posted answers).	0.20861856639385223	High	Semantic Scholar
For example, a rational user likely adapts others ’ opinions, revises his inclinations, and posts a more appropriate answer after understanding the given question and previously posted answers.	0.6538770794868469	High	Semantic Scholar
As a result, this paper devises an architecture named Temporal Interaction and Causal Influence LSTM (TC-LSTM) to effectively leverage not only the causal influence between question-answer (how appropriate an answer is for a given question) but also the temporal interactions between answers-answer (how a high-quality answer gradually forms).	0.26531171798706055	High	Semantic Scholar
In particular, long short-term memory (LSTM) is used to capture the explicit question-answer influence and the implicit answers-answer interactions.	0.5744380354881287	High	Semantic Scholar

Moreover, making this feedback active—sending the trainer her agent ’ s performance relative to others—further induces more participants to train agents longer and improves the agent ’ s learning.	0.5269550681114197	High	Semantic Scholar
Our further analysis shows that agents trained by trainers affected by both the passive and active social feedback could obtain a higher performance under a score mechanism that could be optimized from the trainer ’ s perspective and the agent ’ s additional active social feedback can keep participants to further train agents to learn policies that can obtain a higher performance under such a score mechanism.	0.27657899260520935	High	Semantic Scholar

As an overall approach, a double loop cascade control is used to deal with the joint friction: in its inner loop a two-degree-of-freedom controller is responsible for the joint position in the presence of Coulomb friction disturbances, while in its outer loop an input-state feedback linearization-based controller is implemented to suppress the vibrations and track an end-effector trajectory.	0.11707925796508789	High	Semantic Scholar

Recently, several algorithms have been proposed for clustering uncertain data, and among them density-based techniques seem promising for handling data uncertainty.	0.12517382204532623	High	Semantic Scholar
However, some issues like losing uncertain information, high time complexity and nonadaptive threshold have not been addressed well in the previous density-based algorithm FDBSCAN and hierarchical density-based algorithm FOPTICS.	0.2281939834356308	High	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we firstly propose a novel density-based algorithm PDBSCAN, which improves the previous FDBSCAN from the following aspects: (1) it employs a more accurate method to compute the probability that the distance between two uncertain objects is less than or equal to a boundary value, instead of the sampling-based method in FDBSCAN; (2) it introduces new definitions of probability neighborhood, support degree, core object probability, direct reachability probability, thus reducing the complexity and solving the issue of nonadaptive threshold (for core object judgement) in FDBSCAN.	0.14271271228790283	High	Semantic Scholar
Then, we modify the algorithm PDBSCAN to an improved version (PDBSCANi), by using a better cluster assignment strategy to ensure that every object will be assigned to the most appropriate cluster, thus solving the issue of nonadaptive threshold (for direct density reachability judgement) in FDBSCAN.	0.16550827026367188	High	Semantic Scholar
Currently, deep neural networks (DNNs) in the field of computer vision have reached image object categorization performance comparable to that of human beings on ImageNet, a data set that contains 1.3 million training images of 1000 categories.	0.12083389610052109	High	Semantic Scholar
We explore whether the DNN neurons (units in DNNs) possess image object representational statistics similar to monkey IT neurons, particularly when the network becomes deeper and the number of image categories becomes larger, using VGG19, a typical and widely used deep network of 19 layers in the computer vision field.	0.28117188811302185	High	Semantic Scholar
Following Lehky, Kiani, Esteky, and Tanaka (2011 , 2014), where the response statistics of 674 IT neurons to 806 image stimuli are analyzed using three measures (kurtosis, Pareto tail index, and intrinsic dimensionality), we investigate the three issues in this letter using the same three measures: (1) the similarities and differences of the neural response statistics between VGG19 and primate IT cortex, (2) the variation trends of the response statistics of VGG19 neurons at different layers from low to high, and (3) the variation trends of the response statistics of VGG19 neurons when the numbers of stimuli and neurons increase.	0.2082236409187317	High	Semantic Scholar

Using a nonlinear Lyapunov-based approach, we prove that if a nonzero internal force is chosen, then the asymptotic stabilization of any desired beam attitude can be achieved with a decentralized and communicationless master–slave admittance controller.	0.17418940365314484	High	Semantic Scholar
If, conversely, a zero internal force is chosen, as done in the majority of the state-of-the-art algorithms, the attitude of the beam is not controllable without communication.	0.4293230175971985	High	Semantic Scholar
Currently, most approaches for the automatic analysis of complex video scenes typically rely on hand-crafted appearance and motion features.	0.14087451994419098	High	Semantic Scholar
However, adopting user defined representations is clearly suboptimal, as it is desirable to learn descriptors specific to the scene of interest.	0.4262712001800537	High	Semantic Scholar
To exploit the complementary information of both appearance and motion patterns, we introduce a novel double fusion framework, combining the benefits of traditional early fusion and late fusion strategies.	0.2360994815826416	High	Semantic Scholar

Memory lifetimes in such memory systems may be defined in a variety of ways.	0.12964564561843872	High	Semantic Scholar
A mean first passage time (MFPT) definition overcomes much of the arbitrariness and many of the problems associated with the more usual signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) definition.	0.2206066995859146	High	Semantic Scholar
Here we extend our earlier work by computing the entire first passage time (FPT) distribution for simple, multistate synapses, from which all statistics, including the MFPT lifetime, may be extracted.	0.1588069349527359	High	Semantic Scholar
By examining the variance in the FPT distribution, we may identify regions in which memory storage is subject to high variability, although MFPT lifetimes are nevertheless robustly positive.	0.2124406397342682	High	Semantic Scholar
FPT-defined memory lifetimes therefore provide an analytically superior approach and also have the virtue of being directly related to a neuron's firing properties.	0.12206745892763138	High	Semantic Scholar

Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) is one of the successful approaches to resolving``the plasticity-stability dilemma"in neural networks, and its supervised learning model called ARTMAP is a powerful tool for classification.	0.1380741447210312	High	Semantic Scholar
Among several improvements, such as Fuzzy or Gaussian based models, the state of art model is Bayesian based one, while solving the drawbacks of others.	0.11413439363241196	High	Semantic Scholar

Therefore, we propose a new ride-sharing model, where each driver has a requirement that if the driver shares a ride with a rider, the shared route percentage (i.e., the ratio of the shared route's distance to the driver's total travel distance) exceeds an expectation rate of the driver, e.g. , 0.8.	0.11062430590391159	High	Semantic Scholar

In this study, we attempt to evaluate the user preferences for web design attributes (i.e., typography, color, content quality, interactivity, and navigation) to determine the trust, satisfaction, and loyalty for uncertainty avoidance cultures.	0.6969442367553711	High	Semantic Scholar
The most relevant and interesting finding is related to typography, which has been rarely discussed in e-commerce literature.	0.8601760864257812	High	Semantic Scholar
Furthermore, the partial least-squares method was adopted to analyze the collected data from the students who participated in the test ($ n $= 558).	0.17611798644065857	High	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, all the web design attributes were observed as important design features to develop user trust and satisfaction for uncertainty avoidance cultures.	0.22069385647773743	High	Semantic Scholar
Although both factors seem to be relevant, the relationship between trust and loyalty was observed to be stronger than between satisfaction and loyalty; thus, trust seems to be a stronger determinant of loyalty for risk/high uncertainty avoidance cultures.	0.5483781099319458	High	Semantic Scholar
This means that experiments yielding a poor performance are usually discarded or given too little influence on the policy update.	0.19189319014549255	High	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a generalization of the relative entropy policy search (REPS) algorithm that takes bad experiences into consideration when computing a policy.	0.12424517422914505	High	Semantic Scholar
Thus, considering that there is a duality between good and bad data samples, both are taken into account in the stochastic search for a policy.	0.4191175699234009	High	Semantic Scholar

In the proposed scheme, first the Frobenius norm is applied on high-order tensors (used for data representation) to minimize the reconstruction error of the reduced tensors.	0.38255417346954346	High	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, a comparative study for different data traces and a real SG testbed is also presented to prove the efficacy of the proposed scheme.	0.14620965719223022	High	Semantic Scholar

Furthermore, this approach is not applicable to the home user, who wants to intuitively group their media without tirelessly labelling the content.	0.6313900947570801	High	Semantic Scholar
Consequently, we propose a solution similar in nature to an active learning paradigm, where a small subset of media is labelled as semantically belonging to the same class, and machine learning is then used to pull this and other related content together in the feature space.	0.11175733804702759	High	Semantic Scholar

Hangya, Sanders, and Kepecs (2016) have proposed that researchers can test the Bayesian model by deriving qualitative signatures of Bayesian confidence (i.e., patterns that one would expect to see if an observer were Bayesian) and looking for those signatures in human or animal data.	0.5947222709655762	High	Semantic Scholar

In this letter, we introduce a novel place representation approach that simultaneously integrates semantic landmarks and holistic information to achieve place recognition in long-term autonomy.	0.3030359745025635	High	Semantic Scholar
The graph nodes encode all landmarks and the holistic image of the place scene recorded in different scenarios.	0.11655572056770325	High	Semantic Scholar
The edges connecting the nodes indicate that these nodes represent the same landmark or place, even though places and landmarks encoded by the nodes may exhibit different appearances in the long-term periods.	0.1625092476606369	High	Semantic Scholar
Then, a graph embedding is learned to preserve the locality in the feature descriptor space, i.e., finding a projection such that the same landmark and place have the identical representation in the new projected descriptor space, no matter in what scenarios they are recorded.	0.25093284249305725	High	Semantic Scholar
