A valid threshold, the diameter is the maximum element in the set of lengths of all shortest paths between pairs of states.	0.4708256721496582	Low	Semantic Scholar

To address this issue, we propose a feature grouping-based mechanism that divides all the features into two groups, where the first group (Similarity Feature) is used to find close neighbors and the second group (Difference Feature) is used to find outliers within the similar neighborhood.	0.42467445135116577	Low	Semantic Scholar

There has been growing interest on agents that represent people â s interests or act on their behalf such as automated negotiators, self-driving cars, or drones.	3.92505370427898e-07	Low	Semantic Scholar
Even though people will interact often with others via these agent representatives, little is known about whether people â s behavior changes when acting through these agents, when compared to direct interaction with others.	6.878825661260635e-05	Low	Semantic Scholar
Here we show that people â s decisions will change in important ways because of these agents; specifically, we showed that interacting via agents is likely to lead people to behave more fairly, when compared to direct interaction with others.	0.019762719050049782	Low	Semantic Scholar

To support this argument, we present four experiments: in Experiment 1 we show that people made fairer offers in the ultimatum and impunity games when interacting via agent representatives, when compared to direct interaction; in Experiment 2, participants were less likely to accept unfair offers in these games when agent representatives were involved; in Experiment 3, we show that the act of thinking about the decisions ahead of timeâi.e., under the so-called â strategy method â âcan also lead to increased fairness, even when no agents are involved; and, finally, in Experiment 4 we show that participants were less likely to reach an agreement with unfair counterparts in a negotiation setting.	1.600202995177824e-05	Low	Semantic Scholar

Ride-sharing (RS) has great values in saving energy and alleviating traffic pressure.	9.894899267237633e-05	Low	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we propose a new ride-sharing model, where each driver has a requirement that if the driver shares a ride with a rider, the shared route percentage (i.e., the ratio of the shared route's distance to the driver's total travel distance) exceeds an expectation rate of the driver, e.g. , 0.8.	0.5954905152320862	Low	Semantic Scholar
We consider two variants of this problem.	0.02467329241335392	Low	Semantic Scholar
The first considers multiple drivers and multiple riders and aims to compute driver-rider pairs to maximize the overall shared route percentage (SRP).	0.10743694752454758	Low	Semantic Scholar
However, it is rather expensive to compute the SRP values for large numbers of driver-rider pairs on road networks.	0.14747093617916107	Low	Semantic Scholar
We repeat above steps until the ratio of the upper bound to the lower bound is not larger than a given approximate rate.	0.5811668038368225	Low	Semantic Scholar
We first prune a large number of drivers that cannot meet the SRP requirements.	0.000495455227792263	Low	Semantic Scholar

Although both factors seem to be relevant, the relationship between trust and loyalty was observed to be stronger than between satisfaction and loyalty; thus, trust seems to be a stronger determinant of loyalty for risk/high uncertainty avoidance cultures.	1.0203533520325436e-06	Low	Semantic Scholar

For binary, lidar-based grid maps, this is essentially the case when the laser beam traverses a voxel that has been observed as occupied, or when the beam is reflected by a voxel that has been observed as empty.	0.10276724398136139	Low	Semantic Scholar
However, in real-world environments, some voxels are neither completely occupied nor completely free.	0.00019953232549596578	Low	Semantic Scholar
These voxels have to be modeled by real-valued variables, whose estimation is an inherently statistical process.	0.4307645261287689	Low	Semantic Scholar
Thus, it is nontrivial to decide whether two sets of observations emerge from the same underlying true map values, and hence from an unchanged environment.	0.14429111778736115	Low	Semantic Scholar
Our main idea is to account for the statistical nature of the estimation by leveraging the full map posteriors instead of only the most likely maps.	0.25152528285980225	Low	Semantic Scholar

Here we show that people â s decisions will change in important ways because of these agents; specifically, we showed that interacting via agents is likely to lead people to behave more fairly, when compared to direct interaction with others.	0.01976272277534008	Low	Semantic Scholar
We argue this occurs because programming an agent leads people to adopt a broader perspective, consider the other side â s position, and rely on social normsâsuch as fairnessâto guide their decision making.	0.02716972306370735	Low	Semantic Scholar
To support this argument, we present four experiments: in Experiment 1 we show that people made fairer offers in the ultimatum and impunity games when interacting via agent representatives, when compared to direct interaction; in Experiment 2, participants were less likely to accept unfair offers in these games when agent representatives were involved; in Experiment 3, we show that the act of thinking about the decisions ahead of timeâi.e., under the so-called â strategy method â âcan also lead to increased fairness, even when no agents are involved; and, finally, in Experiment 4 we show that participants were less likely to reach an agreement with unfair counterparts in a negotiation setting.	1.600202995177824e-05	Low	Semantic Scholar

Hidden units with higher activation value, which give more contributions to the network final performance, will be retained by a lower Dropout rate, while units with lower activation value will be exposed to a higher Dropout rate to compensate the previous part.	0.9523947834968567	Medium	Semantic Scholar

Crossmap Dropout tries to maintain this important correlation yet at the same time break the correlation between each adjacent pixel with respect to all feature maps by applying the same Dropout mask to all feature maps, so that all pixels or units in equivalent positions in each feature map will be either dropped or active during training.	0.9835511445999146	Medium	Semantic Scholar
Moreover, our Biased Dropout takes faster time to converge during training phase, suggesting that assigning noise appropriately in hidden units can lead to an effective regularization.	0.9340750575065613	Medium	Semantic Scholar
