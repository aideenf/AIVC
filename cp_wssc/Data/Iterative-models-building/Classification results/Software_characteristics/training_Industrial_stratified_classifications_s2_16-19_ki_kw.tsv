A valid threshold, the diameter is the maximum element in the set of lengths of all shortest paths between pairs of states.	0.4708256721496582	Low	Semantic Scholar
Rather, an upper bound on the diameter is calculated compositionally, by bounding the diameters of small abstract subsystems, and then composing those.	0.004095389507710934	Low	Semantic Scholar
Such algorithms are further distinguished by: (1) whether the bound calculated for abstractions is the diameter, sublist diameter or recurrence diameter, and (2) the “ direction ” of traversal of the compositional structure, either top-down or bottom-up.	0.31619560718536377	Low	Semantic Scholar

To support this argument, we present four experiments: in Experiment 1 we show that people made fairer offers in the ultimatum and impunity games when interacting via agent representatives, when compared to direct interaction; in Experiment 2, participants were less likely to accept unfair offers in these games when agent representatives were involved; in Experiment 3, we show that the act of thinking about the decisions ahead of time—i.e., under the so-called “ strategy method ” —can also lead to increased fairness, even when no agents are involved; and, finally, in Experiment 4 we show that participants were less likely to reach an agreement with unfair counterparts in a negotiation setting.	1.600202995177824e-05	Low	Semantic Scholar

Business to Business (B2B) marketing aims at meeting the needs of other businesses instead of individual consumers, and thus entails management of more complex business needs than consumer marketing.	6.737415242241696e-05	Low	Semantic Scholar

Two models are considered that satisfy a particular eigenvector condition that this approach requires.	0.534144937992096	Low	Semantic Scholar
In these models, MFPT lifetimes do not exhibit optimality conditions, while in one but not the other, SNR lifetimes do exhibit optimality.	0.3147842288017273	Low	Semantic Scholar
Thus, not only are such optimality conditions artifacts of the SNR approach, but they are also strongly model dependent.	0.4458233714103699	Low	Semantic Scholar

Ride-sharing (RS) has great values in saving energy and alleviating traffic pressure.	9.894899267237633e-05	Low	Semantic Scholar
Therefore, we propose a new ride-sharing model, where each driver has a requirement that if the driver shares a ride with a rider, the shared route percentage (i.e., the ratio of the shared route's distance to the driver's total travel distance) exceeds an expectation rate of the driver, e.g. , 0.8.	0.5954905152320862	Low	Semantic Scholar

However, it is rather expensive to compute the SRP values for large numbers of driver-rider pairs on road networks.	0.14747093617916107	Low	Semantic Scholar

To support this argument, we present four experiments: in Experiment 1 we show that people made fairer offers in the ultimatum and impunity games when interacting via agent representatives, when compared to direct interaction; in Experiment 2, participants were less likely to accept unfair offers in these games when agent representatives were involved; in Experiment 3, we show that the act of thinking about the decisions ahead of time—i.e., under the so-called “ strategy method ” —can also lead to increased fairness, even when no agents are involved; and, finally, in Experiment 4 we show that participants were less likely to reach an agreement with unfair counterparts in a negotiation setting.	1.600202995177824e-05	Low	Semantic Scholar

Specifically, a take-over request with lead time at 10–60 s led to lower crash rate, greater minimum time-to-collision, and lower lateral acceleration.	0.9637060761451721	Medium	Semantic Scholar
However, a longer lead time (e.g. , 15–60 s) was necessary to achieve optimal driver acceptance even though drivers could successfully take over control with shorter lead time (e.g. , 10 s).	0.9158039689064026	Medium	Semantic Scholar

Training a deep neural network with a large number of parameters often leads to overfitting problem.	0.9793787598609924	Medium	Semantic Scholar
Recently, Dropout has been introduced as a simple, yet effective regularization approach to combat overfitting in such models.	0.9550365805625916	Medium	Semantic Scholar
Hidden units with higher activation value, which give more contributions to the network final performance, will be retained by a lower Dropout rate, while units with lower activation value will be exposed to a higher Dropout rate to compensate the previous part.	0.9523947834968567	Medium	Semantic Scholar
The second approach is Crossmap Dropout, which is an extension of the regular Dropout in convolution layer.	0.9121339321136475	Medium	Semantic Scholar
Each feature map in a convolution layer has a strong correlation between each other, particularly in every identical pixel location in each feature map.	0.9854060411453247	Medium	Semantic Scholar
Crossmap Dropout tries to maintain this important correlation yet at the same time break the correlation between each adjacent pixel with respect to all feature maps by applying the same Dropout mask to all feature maps, so that all pixels or units in equivalent positions in each feature map will be either dropped or active during training.	0.9835511445999146	Medium	Semantic Scholar
