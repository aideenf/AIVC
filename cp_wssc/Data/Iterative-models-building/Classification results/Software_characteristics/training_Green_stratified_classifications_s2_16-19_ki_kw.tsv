Low-Rank Representation (LRR) is arguably one of the most powerful paradigms for Multi-view spectral clustering, which elegantly encodes the multi-view local graph/manifold structures into an intrinsic low-rank self-expressive data similarity embedded in high-dimensional space, to yield a better graph partition than their single-view counterparts.	0.054649729281663895	High	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we revisit it with a fundamentally different perspective by discovering LRR as essentially a latent clustered orthogonal projection based representation winged with an optimized local graph structure for spectral clustering; each column of the representation is fundamentally a cluster basis orthogonal to others to indicate its members, which intuitively projects the view-specific feature representation to be the one spanned by all orthogonal basis to characterize the cluster structures.	0.12074840068817139	High	Semantic Scholar
Upon this finding, we propose our technique with the following: (1) We decompose LRR into latent clustered orthogonal representation via low-rank matrix factorization, to encode the more flexible cluster structures than LRR over primal data objects; (2) We convert the problem of LRR into that of simultaneously learning orthogonal clustered representation and optimized local graph structure for each view; (3) The learned orthogonal clustered representations and local graph structures enjoy the same magnitude for multi-view, so that the ideal multi-view consensus can be readily achieved.	0.15962406992912292	High	Semantic Scholar

Low-Rank Representation (LRR) is arguably one of the most powerful paradigms for Multi-view spectral clustering, which elegantly encodes the multi-view local graph/manifold structures into an intrinsic low-rank self-expressive data similarity embedded in high-dimensional space, to yield a better graph partition than their single-view counterparts.	0.054649729281663895	High	Semantic Scholar
In this paper we revisit it with a fundamentally different perspective by discovering LRR as essentially a latent clustered orthogonal projection based representation winged with an optimized local graph structure for spectral clustering; each column of the representation is fundamentally a cluster basis orthogonal to others to indicate its members, which intuitively projects the view-specific feature representation to be the one spanned by all orthogonal basis to characterize the cluster structures.	0.12074840068817139	High	Semantic Scholar
Upon this finding, we propose our technique with the following: (1) We decompose LRR into latent clustered orthogonal representation via low-rank matrix factorization, to encode the more flexible cluster structures than LRR over primal data objects; (2) We convert the problem of LRR into that of simultaneously learning orthogonal clustered representation and optimized local graph structure for each view; (3) The learned orthogonal clustered representations and local graph structures enjoy the same magnitude for multi-view, so that the ideal multi-view consensus can be readily achieved.	0.15962406992912292	High	Semantic Scholar

We find that the response statistics on both single-neuron selectivity and population sparseness of VGG19 neurons are fundamentally different from those of IT neurons in most cases; by increasing the number of neurons in different layers and the number of stimuli, the response statistics of neurons at different layers from low to high do not substantially change; and the estimated intrinsic dimensionality values at the low convolutional layers of VGG19 are considerably larger than the value of approximately 100 reported for IT neurons in Lehky et al.	0.46201956272125244	High	Semantic Scholar

Extensive experiments conducted on various data sets have demonstrated the superiority of our proposal as compared to several existing clustering approaches.	0.23699501156806946	High	Semantic Scholar
For example, two shades of green that are only slightly discriminable are perceived as similar, whereas other pairs of colors, for example, blue and yellow, typically elicit markedly different sensations.	0.17383788526058197	High	Semantic Scholar
To capture the subjective metric of color perception, here we construct a notion of distance in color space based on the physiology of the retina, and is thereby individually tailored for different observers.	0.08763156086206436	High	Semantic Scholar
We then derive a coordinate transformation that defines a new chromatic space in which the Euclidean distance between any two colors is equal to the perceptual distance, as seen by one individual subject, endowed with an arbitrary number of color-sensitive photoreceptors, each with arbitrary absorption probability curves and appearing in arbitrary proportions.	0.21132564544677734	High	Semantic Scholar
Three challenges arise in modeling and planning: the physics involved is nontrivial, the tail is underactuated, and motions of the object are nondeterministic.	0.09566235542297363	High	Semantic Scholar
A sampling-based motion planner, adapted to deal with nondeterministic object motions, is used to optimize motion sequences based on a specified preference over a set of objectives, such as execution time, navigation cost, or collision likelihood.	0.07152125239372253	High	Semantic Scholar
The method produces solutions that suit diverse preferences effectively, and we analyze the complementary nature of dynamic and quasi-static motions, showing that there exist regimes where transitions between the two are indeed desirable, as reflected in the plans produced.	0.5713881850242615	High	Semantic Scholar
Many recent generative models make use of neural networks to transform the probability distribution of a simple low-dimensional noise process into the complex distribution of the data.	0.06573040783405304	High	Semantic Scholar
This raises the question of whether biological networks operate along similar principles to implement a probabilistic model of the environment through transformations of intrinsic noise processes.	0.044217467308044434	High	Semantic Scholar
This allows us to use the proposed networks in a variational learning setting where stochastic backpropagation is used to optimize a lower bound on the data log likelihood, thereby learning a generative model of the data.	0.4800315797328949	High	Semantic Scholar
The learning framework deals with the hybrid nature of legged systems given by different contact configurations: We use the projection of the rigid body dynamics into a subspace consistent with the contact constraints.	0.06586471199989319	High	Semantic Scholar
As a task-specific example, two parsimonious driver steering models of this nature are developed and tested on a dataset of real and simulated driving in near-limit, low-friction circumstances, indicating a clear preference of one model over the other.	0.7418268918991089	High	Semantic Scholar
By means of closed-loop simulations, it is demonstrated that the parameters of this preferred model can generally be accurately estimated from unperturbed driver steering data, using a simple, open-loop fitting method, as long as the vehicle positioning data are reliable.	0.04169773310422897	High	Semantic Scholar
In this paper, we propose a multi-manifold regularized non-negative matrix factorization framework (MMNMF) which can preserve the locally geometrical structure of the manifolds for multi-view clustering.	0.059453051537275314	High	Semantic Scholar

In order to find a low-cost trajectory with computational efficiency, the proposed method expands the RRT tree with long extensions using cross entropy, while the rewiring step of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX"> $\text {RRT} ^ {\ast} $</tex-math> </inline-formula> is used to preserve the asymptotic optimality.	0.5881356000900269	High	Semantic Scholar
This paper proposes a new unsupervised spectral feature selection method to preserve both the local and global structure of the features as well as the samples.	0.5662724375724792	High	Semantic Scholar
Specifically, our method uses the self-expressiveness of the features to represent each feature by other features for preserving the local structure of features, and a low-rank constraint on the weight matrix to preserve the global structure among samples as well as features.	0.6786231994628906	High	Semantic Scholar
Experimental analysis on 12 benchmark datasets showed that the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art feature selection methods in terms of classification performance.	0.09614726155996323	High	Semantic Scholar

The manufacturing process of OLED displays requires a high accuracy and a highly clean transport system because during the evaporation process, organic materials are inherently sensitive to contamination and uniform deposition of an organic layer is important.	0.5211138725280762	High	Semantic Scholar
Roller-based transfer systems are not suitable for OLED evaporation processes because the roller-based system has a poor driving performance due to nonlinear factors such as friction and generates a large amount of dust.	0.09103302657604218	High	Semantic Scholar

To achieve such a highly precise control, especially under vacuum, novel control algorithms such as intelligent section control are applied to minimize abrupt changes in the activation of electromagnets as the carrier moves, and command shaping algorithms are applied to prevent excitation of the resonance mode of the system while at a higher control bandwidth.	0.1464165896177292	High	Semantic Scholar
Spike synchrony, which occurs in various cortical areas in response to specific perception, action, and memory tasks, has sparked a long-standing debate on the nature of temporal organization in cortex.	0.17923299968242645	High	Semantic Scholar
Given the ubiquity of small, strongly excitatory subnetworks in cortex, we thus propose that many experimental observations of spike synchrony can be viewed as signs of input patterns that resemble long-term experience—that is, of patterns with high prior probability.	0.32337456941604614	High	Semantic Scholar
Cloth manipulation by robots is gaining popularity among researchers because of its relevance, mainly (but not only) in domestic and assistive robotics.	0.1206466481089592	High	Semantic Scholar
The required science and technologies begin to be ripe for the challenges posed by the manipulation of soft materials, and many contributions have appeared in the last years.	0.22155477106571198	High	Semantic Scholar
This survey provides a systematic review of existing techniques for the basic perceptual tasks of grasp point localization, state estimation and classification of cloth items, from the perspective of their manipulation by robots.	0.16870254278182983	High	Semantic Scholar
This choice is grounded on the fact that any manipulative action requires to instruct the robot where to grasp, and most garment handling activities depend on the correct recognition of the type to which the particular cloth item belongs and its state.	0.41713279485702515	High	Semantic Scholar
The high interand intraclass variability of garments, the continuous nature of the possible deformations of cloth and the evident difficulties in predicting their localization and extension on the garment piece are challenges that have encouraged the researchers to provide a plethora of methods to confront such problems, with some promising results.	0.24122220277786255	High	Semantic Scholar
The present review constitutes for the first time an effort in furnishing a structured framework of these works, with the aim of helping future contributors to gain both insight and perspective on the subject.	0.648801326751709	High	Semantic Scholar
However, as the service provider is often a third-party delegate of the data owner, the integrity of the query results cannot be guaranteed and is thus imperative to be authenticated.	0.1108640730381012	High	Semantic Scholar
Using these protocols as building blocks, we present a privacy-preserving authentication framework for various aggregate queries and further optimize their authentication performance.	0.2465057075023651	High	Semantic Scholar

Considering a set of robotic tasks which involve physical interaction with the environment, the theoretical knowledge of the full force capacity of the manipulator is a key factor in the design or development of an efficient and economically attractive solution.	0.7143141031265259	High	Semantic Scholar
It may be impossible to withstand a physical interaction in some configurations, while it may be easily sustainable in others that bring the end-effector to the same location.	0.05007591098546982	High	Semantic Scholar
This letter describes a framework for these kind of operations, in which kinematic redundancy is used to explore the full extent of a force capacity for a given manipulator and task (in this letter, the terms “ force ” and “ wrench ” may interchangeably refer to two-, three-, or six-dimensional forces depending on the dimension of the problem and on whether they may or may not include components of translational forces and/or moments.	0.2768174707889557	High	Semantic Scholar
The FCI offers a sound basis for redundancy resolution via optimization or complete redundancy exploration, and may provide good hints for end-effector design.	0.14529533684253693	High	Semantic Scholar
In this kind of task, biased sampling occurs because samples are obtained from specific trajectories dictated by the dynamics of the environment and are usually concentrated in particular convergence regions, which in the long term tend to dominate the approximation in the less sampled regions.	0.6825436353683472	High	Semantic Scholar
The nonstationarity comes from the recursive nature of the estimations typical of temporal difference methods.	0.07427919656038284	High	Semantic Scholar
This nonstationarity has a local profile, varying not only along the learning process but also along different regions of the state space.	0.11159522831439972	High	Semantic Scholar
We propose to deal with these problems using an estimation of the probability density of samples represented with a gaussian mixture model.	0.05688891559839249	High	Semantic Scholar
To deal with the nonstationarity problem, we use the common approach of introducing a forgetting factor in the updating formula.	0.3026537597179413	High	Semantic Scholar
However, instead of using the same forgetting factor for the whole domain, we make it dependent on the local density of samples, which we use to estimate the nonstationarity of the function at any given input point.	0.10840260982513428	High	Semantic Scholar
To address the biased sampling problem, the forgetting factor applied to each mixture component is modulated according to the new information provided in the updating, rather than forgetting depending only on time, thus avoiding undesired distortions of the approximation in less sampled regions.	0.16949981451034546	High	Semantic Scholar
However, traditional dimensionality reduction (DR) methods commonly use the original input features to define the intrinsic structure, which makes the estimated intrinsic structure unreliable since redundant or noisy features may exist in the original input features.	0.042394284158945084	High	Semantic Scholar
Thus a dilemma is that (1) one needs the most suitable feature representation to define the intrinsic structure of data and (2) one should use the proper intrinsic structure of data to perform feature extraction.	0.09970933943986893	High	Semantic Scholar
The structure is learned from the results of feature learning, and the features are learned to preserve the refined structure of data.	0.42176106572151184	High	Semantic Scholar
Notwithstanding the seemingly straightforward nature of the inertial parameter identification problem for multibody systems—the most common formulation is as a linear least-squares estimation problem—existing methods, especially for complex high-dof systems subject to nonpersistent and noisy measurements, tend to be highly sensitive to the choice of initial values, and more often than not converge to ad hoc solutions that lie on arbitrary user-specified boundaries.	0.06449951976537704	High	Semantic Scholar
We argue in this letter that such ill-posed behavior is traceable in large part to the use of the standard Euclidean metric in the regularized least-squares error criterion.	0.05188307911157608	High	Semantic Scholar
We instead make use of the fact that the collection of inertial parameters constitutes a Riemannian manifold with a naturally defined Riemannian metric.	0.08290202170610428	High	Semantic Scholar
