0	Titanium and its alloys are widely used in many clinical applications, but implant-associated infection may lead to implant failure.
1	Because of the increasing concern about antibiotic resistant pathogen, photothermal therapy (PTT) as a new treatment strategy has received considerable attention.
2	In this work, gold nanorods (GNRs) photoexcited by the near-infrared (NIR) light were immobilized on Ti surface by electrostatic surface self-assembly technique.
3	Field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to explore the morphology and composition of the GNRs-modified surface.
4	The photothermal temperature of the immobilized GNRs was measured by an infrared thermal imaging system in real time.
5	In vitro study reveal that the prepared GNRs-modified surface exhibits antibacterial activity against four kinds of bacterial strains including both Gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) under the irradiation of 808 nm laser.
6	Besides, the antibacterial efficiency of the GNRs-modified surface could keep stable after multiple laser exposure.
7	It should be noted that the GNRs-modified surface shows better antibacterial effect against Gram-negative bacilli compared to Gram-positive cocci.
8	Moreover, the GNRs-modified surface has no obvious adverse effect to the osteoblast precursor cells under NIR irradiation.
9	These data demonstrate that the GNRs-modified surface with negligible cytotoxicity and recyclable antibacterial effect provides a favorable model for the translation of photothermal therapy to the clinical application.
10	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES-To explore nurses' perceptions of the impact of a programme designed to train them to teach end-of-life care.
11	BACKGROUND-Central to national and international policies is the need for generalist healthcare staff to have education in end-of-life care.
12	Much end-of-life care education is provided by specialist nurses who often have no specific education development to prepare them to teach.
13	To address this gap an Education Development Programme (EDP) was developed and delivered to specialist nurses.
14	We report on the evaluation of the programme.
15	DESIGN-A qualitative programme evaluation methodology was adopted.
16	METHODS-Data were collected through focus groups, at three hospice education centres in North West England, with a total of 20 participants.
17	Nurses who had completed the EDP were purposively sampled.
18	Data were digitally audio-recorded and subjected to thematic analysis to organise, reduce and refine the data.
19	Ethical approval was obtained.
20	COREQ guidelines have been adhered to in the reporting of this study.
21	RESULTS-Two main themes were identified; learning to teach and building skills to change teaching practice.
22	Participants felt more confident and better prepared to teach.
23	CONCLUSIONS-It cannot be assumed that specialist staff, with teaching in their role, have the skills to facilitate learning.
24	This programme offers a potential method of improving facilitation skills for nurses who have an education element to their role.
25	RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE-Quality end-of-life care is only possible with a skilled workforce, confident and able to apply the principles of compassionate end-of-life care to everyday practice.
26	Appropriately trained, specialist staff are better able to teach others how to deliver good quality end-of-life care.
27	Specialist staff with teaching responsibilities should be provided with, or engage in, Continuous Professional Development to develop their skills and improve their efficacy when teaching.

30	Many alien plant species are introduced to urban areas to create, augment or restore ecosystem services (ES).
31	However, many of these species spread beyond original plantings, sometimes causing negative effects on existing ES or creating novel ecosystem disservices (EDS).
32	An understanding of the perceptions of urban residents regarding invasive alien plants (IAPs) and the ES and EDS they provide is needed for the effective prioritisation of IAP management efforts in cities.
33	Using the city of Cape Town, South Africa as a case study, we conducted questionnaire-based surveys (online and face-to-face) to determine the perceptions of urban residents regarding IAPs and their capacity to provide ES and EDS.
34	Most urban residents perceive IAPs negatively (i.e.
35	agreeing that they create EDS), but many recognise their importance in providing ES.
36	Although most residents are not opposed to the management of IAPs, such actions are not perceived as a high priority relative to other environmental problems.
37	Socio-demographic variables such as age, education, environmental awareness, and ethnicity shape urban residents' perceptions of IAPs.
38	Older, more educated respondents were more likely to perceive IAPs negatively, while respondents with greater environmental awareness were aware of the benefits provided by IAPs.
39	This study highlights the need to integrate public perceptions into the planning and management of IAPs and emphasises the importance of including ES assessments into the decision-making process, particularly in urban areas.
40	Semiconductor quantum dots have attracted increasing attention, owing to their unique optical and electrical properties compared to traditional organic fluorescent dyes.
41	However, one of the main obstacles impeding their biological applications is their biocompatibility.
42	Hence, in this work, for achieving biocompatible quantum dots, oil-soluble ZnAgInSe/ZnS quantum dots without highly toxic heavy metals were selected, and four kinds of biocompatible thiols (dihydrolipoic acid, L-cysteine, N-acetyl-L-cysteine and glutathione) were explored as their water transfer agents.
43	Among them, dihydrolipoic acid was found to be more favorable for achieving strongly fluorescent water-soluble quantum dots.
44	Based on this observation, a tumor targeted ligand, namely dihydrolipoic acid-poly(ethylene glycol)-succinic anhydride-cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartate, was designed to further enhance their tumor targeting ability.
45	By means of in vitro cell and in vivo mice experiments, dihydrolipoic acid-poly(ethylene glycol)-succinic anhydride-cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartate stabilized ZnAgInSe/ZnS quantum dots were confirmed to have a high affinity for αvβ₃ integrin receptor-positive U87MG tumor.
46	This study demonstrates the versatility of highly fluorescent, broadly emissive ZnAgInSe/ZnS quantum dots for multi-scale biomedical optical imaging.
47	OBJECTIVE-To formulate novel glass ionomer cements (GICs) containing zirconia (nanoparticles (NPs) and micro-particles (MPs)) and investigate the genotoxic effect of their eluates on DNA double-strand breaks of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) in vitro using a γ-H2AX fluorescent assay.
48	METHODS-GIC (control, C), 10%ZrO2NPsGIC (T1) and 10%ZrO2MPsGIC (T2) were prepared per the manufacturer's instructions (hand-mixed, P/L=3.4:1w/w%).
49	Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was used as the culture medium for HGFs and for eluate preparation.
50	Eluates were collected from all specimens (n=5/g, 5×2mm) after 24h and used for XTT to obtain the EC50 using Graph Pad Prism4.
51	A γ-H2AX immunofluorescence assay was performed to detect DSBs in HGFs.
52	The mean foci per cells and percentage of free foci cells were statistically compared (one-way ANOVA with Tamhane's post hoc and Chi-square respectively) (p<0.05).
53	RESULTS-(1) EC50 ranged from 31 to 36%.
54	5% and 20% eluate concentrations were selected for the genotoxicity test.
55	(2) Cells exposed to eluates from T1 had lower mean foci per cell than cells in T2 and C eluates (p<0.05).
56	Only cells in T1 at 5% had lower mean foci cell than medium (p<0.05).
57	(3) T1 and C at both concentration showed a higher, but not significant, percentage of free foci cells than negative control (medium).
58	At 20% eluate concentration T2 had a lower percentage of free foci cells than C (p<0.05).
59	SIGNIFICANCE-Nano-zirconia GIC and micro-zirconia GIC were formulated.
60	GIC and both zirconia modified GICs had no genotoxic effect on HGFs in vitro.
61	Further studies related to physical properties should be performed to determine the future clinical applications for these novel nanomaterials.
62	Rice is the foremost staple food in the world, safeguarding the global food and nutritional security.
63	Rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and water deficits are threatening global rice productivity and sustainability.
64	Under real field conditions these climatic factors often interact with each other resulting in impacts that are remarkably different compared to individual factor exposure.
65	Rice soils exposed to drought and elevated CO2 (eCO2) alters the biomass, diversity and activity of soil microorganisms affecting greenhouse gas (GHG) emission dynamics.
66	In this review we have discussed the impacts of eCO2 and water deficit on agronomic, biochemical and physiological responses of rice and GHGs emissions from rice soils.
67	Drought usually results in oxidative stress due to stomatal closure, dry weight reduction, formation of reactive oxygen species, decrease in relative water content and increase in electrolyte leakage at almost all growth and developmental phases of rice.
68	Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration reduces the negative effects of drought by improving plant water relations, reducing stomatal opening, decreasing transpiration, increasing canopy photosynthesis, shortening crop growth period and increasing the antioxidant metabolite activities in rice.
69	Increased scientific understanding of the effects of drought and eCO2 on rice agronomy, physiology and GHG emission dynamics of rice soil is essential for devising adaptation options.
70	Integration of novel agronomic practices viz., crop establishment methods and alternate cropping systems with improved water and nutrient management are important steps to help rice farmers cope with drought and eCO2.
71	The review summarizes future research needs for ensuring sustained global food security under future warmer, drier and high CO2 conditions.
72	Exploratory factor analyses are commonly used to determine the underlying factors of multiple observed variables.
73	Many criteria have been suggested to determine how many factors should be retained.
74	In this study, we present an extensive Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the performance of extraction criteria under varying sample sizes, numbers of indicators per factor, loading magnitudes, underlying multivariate distributions of observed variables, as well as how the performance of the extraction criteria are influenced by the presence of cross-loadings and minor factors for unidimensional, orthogonal, and correlated factor models.
75	We compared several variants of traditional parallel analysis (PA), the Kaiser-Guttman Criterion, and sequential χ2 model tests (SMT) with 4 recently suggested methods: revised PA, comparison data (CD), the Hull method, and the Empirical Kaiser Criterion (EKC).
76	No single extraction criterion performed best for every factor model.
77	In unidimensional and orthogonal models, traditional PA, EKC, and Hull consistently displayed high hit rates even in small samples.
78	Models with correlated factors were more challenging, where CD and SMT outperformed other methods, especially for shorter scales.
79	Whereas the presence of cross-loadings generally increased accuracy, non-normality had virtually no effect on most criteria.
80	We suggest researchers use a combination of SMT and either Hull, the EKC, or traditional PA, because the number of factors was almost always correctly retrieved if those methods converged.
81	When the results of this combination rule are inconclusive, traditional PA, CD, and the EKC performed comparatively well.
82	However, disagreement also suggests that factors will be harder to detect, increasing sample size requirements to N ≥ 500.

84	BACKGROUND-Effective dissemination of technology in global surgery is vital to realize universal health coverage by 2030.
85	Challenges include a lack of human resource, infrastructure and finance.
86	Understanding these challenges, and exploring opportunities and solutions to overcome them, are essential to improve global surgical care.
87	METHODS-This review focuses on technologies and medical devices aimed at improving surgical care and training in low- and middle-income countries.
88	The key considerations in the development of new technologies are described, along with strategies for evaluation and wider dissemination.
89	Notable examples of where the dissemination of a new surgical technology has achieved impact are included.
90	RESULTS-Employing the principles of frugal and responsible innovation, and aligning evaluation and development to high scientific standards help overcome some of the challenges in disseminating technology in global surgery.
91	Exemplars of effective dissemination include low-cost laparoscopes, gasless laparoscopic techniques and innovative training programmes for laparoscopic surgery; low-cost and versatile external fixation devices for fractures; the LifeBox pulse oximeter project; and the use of immersive technologies in simulation, training and surgical care delivery.
92	CONCLUSION-Core strategies to facilitate technology dissemination in global surgery include leveraging international funding, interdisciplinary collaboration involving all key stakeholders, and frugal scientific design, development and evaluation.
93	OBJECTIVE-To evaluate the serum vitamin D level in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and its correlation with the disease severity.
94	SETTING-Hospital of Zhejiang University.
95	STUDY DESIGN-Retrospective analysis of collected data.
96	SUBJECTS AND METHODS-Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery were recruited.
97	Demographic information including age, gender, body mass index, smoke history, atopic status and asthma was collected.
98	Disease severity was measured by the Lund-Mackay CT score and Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 score.
99	Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay preoperatively.
100	RESULTS-Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels were significantly lower in patients with nasal polyps (CRSwNP, 38.2 ± 9.1 nmol/L; CRSsNP, 48.94 ± 12.1 nmol/L; control, 54.1 ± 17.1 nmol/L.
101	p < 0.001), and the levels were significantly associated with the preoperative Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 score (p = 0.013), but not with the Lund-Mackay score (p = 0.126).
102	Furthermore, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels were associated with the subjective improvement six months postoperatively (p < 0.001), CONCLUSION: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels are lower in Chinese CRSwNP patients.
103	These 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels are associated with SNOT-22 score.
104	Preoperative 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 level may impact on the symptom improvement after surgery.
105	The pathophysiology and management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) are subject of debate.
106	Despite advances in the understanding of its etiopathogenesis and improvements in its management, implementation in clinical practice is suboptimal.
107	In this manuscript, we review the recent literature with a focus on PSP pathophysiology and management.
108	Blebs and emphysema-like changes (ELC) are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of PSP but cannot explain all cases.
109	Recent studies emphasize the role of a diffuse porosity of the visceral pleura.
110	Others found a relationship between smoking, occurrence of a PSP and bronchiolitis, which could be the initial pathological process leading to ELC development.
111	Recent or ongoing studies challenge the need to systematically remove air from the pleural cavity of stable patients, introducing conservative management as a valuable therapeutic option.
112	Evidence is growing in favor of needle aspiration instead of chest tube insertion, when air evacuation is needed.
113	In addition, ambulatory management is considered as a successful approach in meta-analyses and is under exploration in a large randomized study.
114	Because of a high recurrence rate of PSP, the benefit of performing a pleurodesis at first occurrence is under evaluation with interesting but not generalizable results.
115	Better identification of "at risk patients" is needed to improve the investigation strategy.
116	Finally recent publications confirm the efficacy, security and cost-effectiveness of graded talc poudrage pleurodesis to prevent PSP recurrence.
117	In conclusion, PSP pathophysiology and management are still under investigation.
118	Results of recently published and ongoing studies should be more widely implemented in clinical practice.

121	Cell differentiation is driven by changes in gene expression that manifest as changes in cellular phenotype or function.
122	Altered cellular phenotypes, stemming from genetic mutations or other perturbations, are widely assumed to directly correspond to changes in the transcriptome and vice versa.
123	Here, we exploited the cytologically well-defined Prdm9 mutant mouse as a model of developmental arrest to test whether parallel programs of cellular differentiation and gene expression are tightly coordinated, or can be disassociated.
124	By comparing cytological phenotype markers and transcriptomes in wild-type and mutant spermatocytes, we identified multiple instances of cellular and molecular uncoupling in Prdm9-/- mutants.
125	Most notably, although Prdm9-/- germ cells undergo cytological arrest in a late-leptotene/zygotene stage, they nevertheless develop gene expression signatures characteristic of later developmental substages.
126	These findings suggest that transcriptomic changes may not reliably map to cellular phenotypes in developmentally perturbed systems.
127	High resolution imaging systems for EUV range are based on multilayer optics.
128	Current generation of EUV lithography uses broadband Sn LPP sources, which requires broadband mirrors to fully utilize the source power.
129	On the other hand, there always remains a possibility to use FEL or synchrotron as EUV source.
130	FEL can produce very bright narrowband EUV light of a tunable wavelength, and the spectral bandwidth of the mirror is no longer a restriction.
131	In this paper we look at the consequences of switching to different wavelengths if FEL source is used.
132	For instance, it is known that the reflectance of Mo/Si multilayers increases when approaching Si L-edge, and the spectral bandwidth drops.
133	But the behavior of an angular bandwidth (and its relation with the spectral bandwidth) is usually left out.
134	It is also sometimes assumed that these bandwidths are correlated.
135	For a large aperture EUV optical system with diffraction-limited resolution angular acceptance of a mirror is also a very important parameter.
136	We show that the angular bandwidth of several multilayer systems (Mo/Si, Mo/Be, Ru/Si, Ru/B, La/B) actually increases close to spacer absorption edges, opposite to what occurs with the spectral bandwidth.
137	We study this effect and show that it is caused by an interplay of changing optical constants of respective materials used in these multilayer combinations.
138	We also provide an experimental check of the angular bandwidth of Mo/Si multilayers at 13.5 and 12.6 nm, which confirms our calculations.
139	In the diagnosis and interventional treatment of coronary artery disease, the 3D[Formula: see text]time reconstruction of the coronary artery on the basis of x-ray angiographic image sequences can provide dynamic structural information.
140	The synchronization of cardiac phases in the sequences is essential for minimizing the influence of cardiorespiratory motion and realizing precise 3D[Formula: see text]time reconstruction.
141	Key points are initially extracted from the first image of a sequence.
142	Matching grid points between consecutive images in the sequence are extracted by a multi-layer matching strategy.
143	Then deep motion tracking (DMT) of key points is achieved by local deformation based on the neighboring grid points of key points.
144	The local deformation is optimized by the Random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm.
145	Then, a simple harmonic motion (SHM) model is utilized to distinguish cardiac motion from other motion sources (e.g.
146	respiratory, patient movement, etc).
147	Next, the signal which is composed of cardiac motions is filtered by a band-pass filter to reconstruct the cardiac phases.
148	Finally, the synchronization of cardiac phases from different imaging angles is realized by a piece-wise linear transformation.
149	The proposed method was evaluated using clinical x-ray angiographic image sequences from 13 patients.
150	[Formula: see text] matching points can be accurately computed by the DMT method.
151	The mean peak temporal distance (MPTD) between the reconstructed cardiac phases and the electrocardiograph signal is [Formula: see text] s. The correlation between the cardiac phases of the same patient is over [Formula: see text].
152	Compared with three other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method accurately reconstructs and synchronizes the cardiac phases from different sequences of the same patient.
153	The proposed DMT method is robust and highly effective in synchronizing cardiac phases of angiographic image sequences captured from different imaging angles.
154	It is estimated that around five to 10.0% of hospital admissions occur due to clinical conditions resulting from pharmacotherapy.
155	Clinical pharmacist's activity can enhance drug therapy's effectiveness and safety through pharmacotherapy interventions (PIs), thus minimizing drug-related problems (DRPs) and optimizing the allocation of financial resources associated with health care.
156	This study aimed to estimate the DRPs prevalence, evaluate PI which were performed by clinical pharmacists in the Neurology Unit of a Brazilian tertiary teaching hospital and to identify factors associated with the occurrence of PI-related DRP.
157	A single-arm trial included adults admitted in the referred Unit from 2012 July to 2015 June.
158	Patients were evaluated during their hospitalization period and PIs were performed based on trigger DRPs that were detected in medication reconciliation (admission or discharge) or during inpatient follow-up.
159	Student's t-test, Chi-square test, Pearson and Multiple logistic regression models to analise the association among age, number of drugs, hospitalization period, and number of diagnoses with occurrence of DRPs.
160	Analyses level of significance was 5%.
161	In total 409 inpatients were followed up [51.1% male, mean age of 49.1 (SD 16.5)].
162	Patients received, on average, 11.9 (SD 5.8) drugs, ranging from two to 38 drugs per patient, and 54.3% of the sample presented at least one DRP whose most frequent description was "untreated condition".
163	From all 516 performed PIs that resulted from DRPs, 82.8% were accepted and the majority referred to "drug introduction" (27.5%).
164	Multiple logistic regression showed that age, length of hospital stay, number of drugs used, diagnosis of epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and myasthenia gravis would be clinical variables associated with DRP (p < 0,05).
165	Monitoring the use of drugs allowed the clinical pharmacist to detect DRPs and to suggest interventions that promote rational pharmacotherapy.
166	This article represents the results of testing the surface condition of shafts manufactured by the burnishing process.
167	The shafts with a hardness of approximately 62 HRC (Rockwell C).
168	were burnished with a ceramic ball (Si₃N₄), where the force range was controlled by the means of a hydraulic system.
169	The machining process consisted of hard turning shafts with cubic boron nitride (CBN) inserts, followed by burnishing with the use of various machining parameters, such as feed and force.
170	The research focused on the examination of burnished surfaces, which was conducted for various structures after hard turning, and with variable burnishing parameters.
171	The results obtained for the decrease of roughness are presented as the relation between the parameters Rat/Rab, which is approximately 2, while for Rpkt/Rpkb, it is around 3.7, respectively.
172	Sat/Sab is around 2, while Spkt/Spkb is around 3.5 (where an index denotes the t-surface after turning, and the index b-surface after burnishing).
173	The structure of the surface after burnishing and turning is described with roughness parameters, as well as with the photographs of the specimen surface, and the bearing area curve.
174	The availability of analytical methods for quantification of allergens is crucial for the correct assessment and labeling of products in order to protect allergic consumers.
175	For this purpose, a simple, sensitive and accurate technique was developed based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (LC-MRM-MS/MS).
176	The proposed method uses a simple purification with heat and a completely optimized tryptic digestion.
177	This method has been validated according to the requirements defined by ICH (Q2 [R1]), having a linear range from 0.10 to 1179.36 nM with r > 0.999.
178	The parvalbumin beta in flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) has been quantified at a low level down to 0.10 µg/g with satisfactory precision (RSD < 18.35%) and accuracy (<13.3%).
179	The new approach was successfully applied for the determination of parvalbumin beta in the other food matrices.
180	This study determined the optimal extraction conditions for ultrasonic-cellulase synergistic extraction of polysaccharides from pineapple pomace (PPP) using Plackett-Burman design and response surface methodology.
181	The optimal hydrolysis temperature, ratio of material to water, pH value, hydrolysis time, ultrasonic power and the additive quantity of cellulase were 50 °C, 1:45 g/mL, 6.0, 100 min, 160 W and 2.0%, respectively, giving a extraction yield of 1.10 ± 0.03%.
182	PPP was further isolated and purified by DEAE-52 cellulose and Sephadex G-100 chromatography columns, revealing four main elution peaks, named PPF0, PPF1, PPP2 and PPF3, were obtained.
183	The molecular weight, monosaccharide compositions, structural features and appearance morphology of polysaccharide fractions (PPFs) were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), UV spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
184	Furthermore, the hypoglycemic activities of PPFs with different concentrations were also investigated by insulin resistance HepG2 cells model in vitro.
185	Results showed that PPF0, PPF1, PPF2 and PPF3 were composed of mannose, rhamnose, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, glucose, galactose, xylose, arabinose and fucose with molecular weight of 6.71 × 104, 1.11 × 104, 2.22 × 104 and 5.1 × 103 Da, respectively.
186	All of them could alleviate the development of insulin resistance HepG2 cells with a dose-dependent relationship.
187	The glucose consumption increased 46.4%, 50.5%, 82.1% and 53.6%; 86.8%, 81.6%, 86.8% and 84.2% at the concentration of 20 μg/mL, respectively, without or with insulin.
188	These results suggested that PPFs can be explored as a potential hypoglycemic agent in biomedical and functional food.
189	Nutations of plant organs are significantly affected by the circatidal modulation in the gravitational force exerted by the Moon and Sun (lunisolar tidal acceleration, Etide).
190	In a previous study on nutational rotations of stem apices, we observed abrupt alterations in their direction and irregularities of the recorded trajectories.
191	Such transitions have not yet been analysed in detail.
192	Peppermint plants were continuously recorded with time-lapse photography and aligned with contemporaneous time courses of the Etide estimates.
193	Each nutational stem tip movement path was assigned to one of two groups, depending on its geometry, as: (i) regular elliptical movements and (ii) irregular movements (with a random type of trajectory).
194	Analyses of the correlation between the plant nutation trajectory parameters and Etide, as well as of the trajectory geometry of the individual plants were performed.
195	The trajectory geometry of young mint stem apices was related to the velocity of the apex rotation and significantly affected by the gravitational force estimated from the Etide.
196	A low velocity of nutational movement, associated with the random character of the trajectory, usually occurred simultaneously with local minima or maxima of Etide.
197	As the mint plant ages, the transitions in the stem tip trajectory were limited; no correspondence with Etide dynamics was observed.
198	The results indicate that the plant tip geometry path transitions with respect to the changing gradient of lunisolar tidal acceleration could be interpreted as manifestation of a continuous accommodation of the shoot apical part to the state of minimum energy dissipation.
199	Objectives-To investigate the risk of colonization with ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-Ec) in humans in Vietnam associated with non-intensive chicken farming.
200	Methods-Faecal samples from 204 randomly selected farmers and their chickens, and from 306 age- and sex-matched community-based individuals who did not raise poultry were collected.
201	Antimicrobial usage in chickens and humans was assessed by medicine cabinet surveys.
202	WGS was employed to obtain a high-resolution genomic comparison between ESBL-Ec isolated from humans and chickens.
203	Results-The adjusted prevalence of ESBL-Ec colonization was 20.0% (95% CI 10.8%-29.1%) and 35.2% (95% CI 30.4%-40.1%) in chicken farms and humans in Vietnam, respectively.
204	Colonization with ESBL-Ec in humans was associated with antimicrobial usage (OR = 2.52, 95% CI = 1.08-5.87) but not with involvement in chicken farming.
205	blaCTX-M-55 was the most common ESBL-encoding gene in strains isolated from chickens (74.4%) compared with blaCTX-M-27 in human strains (47.0%).
206	In 3 of 204 (1.5%) of the farms, identical ESBL genes were detected in ESBL-Ec isolated from farmers and their chickens.
207	Genomic similarity indicating recent sharing of ESBL-Ec between chickens and farmers was found in only one of these farms.
208	Conclusions-The integration of epidemiological and genomic data in this study has demonstrated a limited contribution of non-intensive chicken farming to ESBL-Ec colonization in humans in Vietnam and further emphasizes the importance of reducing antimicrobial usage in both human and animal host reservoirs.
209	OBJECTIVES-Digoxin poisoning is a frequent reason for seeking emergency care.
210	This study aimed to assess mortality related to digoxin poisoning.
211	MATERIAL AND METHODS-Descriptive observational study of digoxin poisonings attended in the emergency departments of 4 hospitals in Catalonia from 2013 through 2015.
212	We gathered data relevant to the poisonings and recorded immediate and 30-day mortality.
213	Factors possibly related to mortality were explored.
214	RESULTS-A total of 171 digoxin poisonings were attended.
215	Seven (4.1%) were acute and 164 (95.9%) were chronic.
216	The immediate and 30-day mortality rates were 6.4% and 13.4%, respectively.
217	Bivariate analysis did not identify factors related to immediate mortality.
218	However, the variables more often associated with 30-day mortality in this analysis were acute poisoning (after which 13% died vs 2.7% of those with chronic poisoning, P=.05), suicide attempts (8.7% of whom died vs 0.7%, P=.048), more compromised renal function (21.7% vs 9.5%, P=.037), fewer neurologic symptoms (4.3% vs 17.8% with more symptoms, P=.005), higher mean digoxin concentrations (4.7 mg/dL in those who died vs 3.7 mg/dL, P=.027), and a lower Barthel index (mean [SD] 49.1 [33.4] in those who died vs 70.3 [28.5]; P=.006).
219	Logistic regression analysis identified serum digoxin concentration to be independently associated with immediate mortality.
220	A lower Barthel index was associated with 30-day mortality.
221	CONCLUSION-Immediate mortality is related to a high digoxin concentration in serum, and 30-day mortality to a low Barthel index.
222	INTRODUCTION-RNA isolation from tumor tissue is used for biomarker analyses and validation.
223	Limited diagnostic material from small volume biopsies combined with an increasing demand for standard histologic, molecular characterization, and next generation sequencing applications often leads to limited material for research.
224	We sought to evaluate small volume sampling of lung cancer tissue collected from a single needle pass during a diagnostic procedure and determine if it can provide RNA of acceptable quantity and quality.
225	METHODS-We enrolled 140 patients with probable primary bronchogenic carcinoma and collected RNA from a dedicated FNA aspiration.
226	Total RNA (ηg), RNA integrity number (RIN), and %Mass in base pairs were evaluated from each patient sample.
227	A customized nanoString nCounter® 95-gene panel was used to profile the expression patterns of feature NSCLC genes.
228	We compared gene expression patterns that distinguish lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) in our cohort with a corresponding Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) NSCLC datasets.
229	RESULTS-Of the 149 patients consented.
230	RNA-extraction was performed in 101 eligible patients.
231	A satisfactory total RNA mass and RIN was quantified for all samples with a similar distribution among cellular subtypes.
232	Mean %-Mass over 300 base pairs was noted for all specimens and 96% of samples met criteria to perform genetic evaluation with our commercialized gene expression assay.
233	The FNA-derived transcriptomic results showed excellent consistency with the TCGA counterparts, and the differential expression pattern of LUAD vs LUSC subtypes were highly similar.
234	DISCUSSION-In this study, RNA retrieval from a single-pass FNA regardless of procedural approach showed equivalence and suitability for gene expression assessments.
235	RNA extraction from small volume samples has the potential to provide valuable material for genetic profiling.
236	OBJECTIVE-This study aimed to introduce anterior controllable antedisplacement fusion (ACAF), a new surgical technique, to treat multilevel cervical spondylotic myelopathy with spinal stenosis, compared with anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF).
237	METHODS-From January 2016 to June 2017, patients with multilevel cervical spondylotic myelopathy with spinal stenosis (MCSMSS) who underwent ACAF (36 cases) and ACCF (45 cases) were enrolled in this study.
238	Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score was analyzed before the operation and at each time point during the follow-up after surgery to evaluate the neurologic function.
239	Both clinical and radiologic outcomes, and perioperative complications were analyzed.
240	RESULTS-At the final follow-up, the mean JOA scores of the two groups were significantly improved compared with preoperative, respectively (P<0.01, P<0.01).
241	However, the mean JOA scores between the two groups was not statistically significant (13.7±1.9 vs. 13.5±1.8; P=0.66).
242	The operative duration was longer and the blood loss was higher in ACAF group than in ACCF group.
243	The overall occurrence of complications in ACAF group was significantly lower than that in ACCF group (P<0.05).
244	CONCLUSIONS-ACAF has similar clinical and radiological outcomes and less complications compared with ACCF in the treatment of MCSMSS, and ACAF can be used as an alternative for cervical stenosis.
245	Background and purpose - There are no national guidelines for treatment of hip fractures in Estonia and no studies on management.
246	We assessed treatment methods and mortality rates for hip fracture patients in Estonia.
247	Patients and methods - We studied a population-based retrospective cohort using validated data from the Estonian Health Insurance Fund's database.
248	The cohort included patients aged 50 and over with an index hip fracture diagnosis between January 1, 2009 and September 30, 2017.
249	The study generated descriptive statistics of hip fracture management methods and calculated in-hospital, 1-, 3, 6-, and 12-month unadjusted all-cause mortality rates.
250	[CrossRef] Results - 91% (number of hips: 11,628/12,731) of the original data were included after data validation.
251	Median patient age was 81 years, 83 years for women and 74 years for men.
252	28% were men.
253	Treatment methods were: total hip arthroplasty 7%; hemiarthroplasty 25%; screws 6%; sliding hip screw 25%; intramedullary nail 27%; and nonoperative management 10%.
254	Unadjusted all-cause mortality rates for in-hospital, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months were: 3%, 9%, 18%, 24%, and 31% respectively.
255	The 12-month mortality rate for nonoperative management was 58%.
256	[CrossRef] Interpretation - High rates of nonoperative management and overall high 1-year mortality rates after an index hip fracture indicate the need to review exclusion criteria for surgery and subacute care in Estonia.
257	To compare the value of Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data Systems proposed by Kwak (KWAK-TIRADS) and ACR (ACR TI-RADS) and 2015 American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines in the diagnosis of surgically resected thyroid nodules.
258	From January 2015 to December 2015, 2544 thyroid nodules in 1758 patients who underwent thyroidectomy at our center were included.
259	The KWAK-TIRADS category, ACR TI-RADS and ultrasound (US) pattern based on ATA guidelines were assigned to each thyroid nodule.
260	Nodules were divided into groups according to their maximal diameter further.
261	Of all the nodules, 863 (33.9%) were benign, whereas 1681 (66.1%) were malignant.
262	The malignancy percentage of ACR TI-RADS category 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 0%, 1.3%, 9.1%, 52.5%, and 88.8%, respectively.
263	KWAK-TIRADS and ATA guidelines showed a better diagnostic efficiency than ACR TI-RADS (P < 0.01).
264	ACR TI-RADS demonstrated a higher specificity (79.7%, P < 0.05), whereas the ATA US pattern had a higher sensitivity (95.5%, P < 0.01).
265	The TIRADS (KWAK-TIRADS and ACR TI-RADS) category and ATA guidelines performed better in differentiating nodules >1 cm.
266	KWAK-TIRADS showed better diagnostic efficiency than the other methods in differentiating nodules >1 cm (AUC: 0.92, P < 0.01).
267	KWAK-TIRADS and ATA guidelines provide a better diagnostic efficiency than ACR TI-RADS.
268	The TIRADS (KWAK-TIRADS and ACR TI-RADS) category and ATA guidelines perform better in differentiating nodules >1 cm than nodules ≤1 cm.
269	KWAK-TIRADS perform better in differentiating nodules >1 cm than other methods.
270	Phosphodiesterase-10a (PDE10a) is located exclusively in medium spiny neurons (MSN).
271	Rodent studies show an increase in striatal MSN spine density following exposure to cocaine.
272	These increases in MSN spine density are suggested to underlie neurobiological changes which contribute to cocaine self-administration.
273	No postmortem or imaging studies have confirmed this finding in humans.
274	Here, we hypothesized an increase in the MSN marker PDE10a in subjects with cocaine use disorder ("cocaine users") compared to controls.
275	PDE10a availability was measured with [11 C]IMA107 and positron emission tomography in 15 cocaine users and 15 controls matched for age, gender, and nicotine status.
276	Cocaine users with no comorbid psychiatric, medical, or drug abuse disorders were scanned following two weeks of outpatient-monitored abstinence.
277	[11 C]IMA107 binding potential relative to nondisplaceable uptake (BPND ) in the regions of interest was derived with the simplified reference tissue method.
278	No significant effect of diagnosis on BPND was demonstrated using linear mixed modeling with [11 C]IMA107 BPND as the dependent variable and regions of interest as a repeated measure.
279	There were no significant relationships between BPND and clinical rating scales.
280	To the extent that PDE10a is a valid proxy for MSN spine density, these results do not support its increase in recently abstinent cocaine users.
281	BACKGROUND-Polydrug use is a major public health issue associated with numerous undesirable physical and mental health outcomes.
282	While past research has identified risk factors for polydrug use and elevated drug use variety, there has yet to be any research which seeks to examine this phenomenon from a developmental perspective.
283	There also has yet to be any research which examines the impact of risk factors for predicting differential development.
284	OBJECTIVES-Identify developmental subgroups of polydrug use.
285	Identify risk factors predicting heterogeneity in development.
286	METHODS-The Pathways to Desistance data were used in this research.
287	The present study used group-based trajectory modeling to elucidate general developmental patterns of drug use variety and sought to identify risk factors predicting the heterogeneity in the development of this outcome using multinomial logistic regression among a sample of juvenile offenders.
288	RESULTS-A six group model best fit the drug use variety count data.
289	Several risk factors were identified which predicted assignment to the most problematic developmental subgroup, including: low self-control, low religiosity, and history of victimization at baseline.
290	White participants were more likely to engage in any level of drug use.
291	Conclusions/Importance: These results indicate that juvenile offenders are at-risk for chronic issues with polydrug use and more general engagement in polydrug use.
292	Public health and criminal justice professionals should work together to develop and implement psychosocial interventions for targeting risk factors associated with accelerating and chronic polydrug use.
293	Small-to-medium scale smart buildings are an important part of the Internet of Things (IoT).
294	Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are the major enabler for smart control in such environments.
295	Reliability is among the key performance requirements for many loss-sensitive IoT and WSN applications, while Energy Consumption (EC) remains a primary concern in WSN design.
296	Error-prone links, traffic intense applications, and limited physical resources make it challenging to meet these service goals-not only that these performance metrics often conflict with one another, but also require solving optimization problems, which are intrinsically NP-hard.
297	Correctly forecasting Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and EC can play a significant role in different loss-sensitive application environments.
298	With the ever-increasing availability of performance data, data-driven techniques are becoming popular in such settings.
299	It is observed that a number of communication parameters like transmission power, packet size, etc., influence metrics like PDR and EC in diverse ways.
300	In this work, different regression models including linear, gradient boosting, random forest, and deep learning are used for the purpose of predicting both PDR and EC based on such communication parameters.
301	To evaluate the performance, a public dataset of the IEEE 802.15.4 network, containing measurements against more than 48,000 combinations of parameter configurations, is used.
302	Results are evaluated using root mean square error and it turns out that deep learning achieves up to 98% accuracy for both PDR and EC predictions.
303	These prediction results can help configure communication parameters taking into account the performance goals.
304	Mini Abstract: Pregnancy-associated osteoporosis (PAO) is a rare syndrome affecting women during late pregnancy and the early postpartum period.
305	We set out to review the clinical features of ten cases of PAO from a single UK centre.
306	Patients had attended the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, Bath (RNHRD) between January 2000 and June 2016.
307	The principal criterion for inclusion was the occurrence of low trauma fractures either during pregnancy or the immediate post-partum period.
308	Data were obtained from retrospective review of medical notes.
309	Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Hologic ®Discovery system) at the lumbar spine and hip.
310	Data pertaining to the pregnancy, as well as type and duration of treatment received, were reviewed.
311	All ten cases presented with vertebral fractures.
312	In four patients, no risk factors for fracture other than pregnancy or breastfeeding could be identified.
313	Four patients were found to have vitamin D insufficiency at the time of diagnosis, and a further two patients had received treatment with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).
314	In one case, further investigation led to a diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) confirmed on genetic testing.
315	In terms of treatment, eight out of the ten patients in this series received a bisphosphonate, most commonly risedronate due to its relatively short skeletal retention time.
316	Clinicians should be aware of PAO, a rare but recognised complication of pregnancy.
317	The condition should be especially considered in women presenting with new onset back pain in pregnancy or the postpartum period.
318	AIMS/INTRODUCTION-To evaluate linagliptin prescribing in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with different comorbidities, an expanded Japanese post-marketing surveillance also collected baseline data for patients initiating other glucose-lowering drugs.
319	MATERIALS AND METHODS-Patients initiating linagliptin monotherapy were enrolled, then the next patient starting monotherapy with another glucose-lowering drug was enrolled (2012-2014).
320	Baseline data were collected and analyzed by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities system organ class.
321	Analyses were descriptive and meaningful differences defined as absolute standardized difference >10%.
322	RESULTS-Over 4200 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients were enrolled.
323	Most system-organ class comorbidities were more common in patients initiating linagliptin vs other glucose-lowering drugs, with meaningful differences observed for metabolism-utritional (50.5 vs 45.5%, respectively), cardiac (12.2 vs 8.6%, respectively), vascular (56.4 vs 51.3%, respectively) and renal/urinary disorders (9.9 vs 5.7%, respectively).
324	CONCLUSIONS-Expanding the linagliptin Japanese post-marketing surveillance revealed linagliptin prescribing to a type 2 diabetes mellitus population with more comorbidities vs other glucose-lowering drugs.
325	Although such preferential prescribing may be expected as linagliptin requires no dose adjustment or monitoring in renally or hepatically impaired patients, this innovative post-marketing surveillance approach generated important evidence that could only be demonstrated in such a non-randomized comparative study.
326	These data generated insights important for the design and interpretation of observational studies and spontaneous reports, which are key for public health.

329	OBJECTIVES-Endoscopic resection is preferred for duodenal carcinoids less than 20 mm; however, the efficacy of simple polypectomy has not been compared with advanced endoscopic resection techniques.
330	METHODS-We performed a retrospective review of 33 patients who underwent endoscopic duodenal carcinoid resection (10 simple, 23 endoscopic mucosal resection) at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania between January 1, 2006, and June 15, 2017.
331	The primary outcomes were resection margin positivity and local tumor recurrence.
332	RESULTS-There were no significant differences in demographics or tumor functionality.
333	Lesions managed with simple polypectomy had smaller median gross specimen size (6.0 mm vs 8.0 mm, P = 0.043).
334	There was no significant difference in pathology resection margins between simple polypectomy and endoscopic mucosal resection (86% vs 68% positive, P = 0.64).
335	Local recurrence on surveillance endoscopy was also similar (14.3% vs 17.7%, respectively; P = 1.000), with median time to recurrence 2.3 months (interquartile range, 1.2-5.4 months).
336	The median follow-up time in patients without local recurrence was 21.4 months (interquartile range, 7.1-39.6 months).
337	CONCLUSIONS-Simple polypectomy may be adequate treatment of small duodenal carcinoids, although further studies are needed for validation and to define the upper limits of tumor size that can be managed with this technique.
338	BACKGROUND-Lymphatic malformations (LMs) are congenital and arise from errors in vascular embryogenesis.
339	LMs are categorized by cyst size as microcystic, macrocystic, or combined.
340	Abdominal LMs are rare.
341	Surgical resection of abdominal LMs has been the mainstay of therapy, but recurrence and morbidity are high.
342	We sought to determine the effectiveness of sclerotherapy treatment for abdominal LM.
343	METHODS-A single-center, retrospective review from 2014 to 2018 was conducted evaluating pediatric patients with abdominal LM.
344	RESULTS-Ten patients were included, n = 9 had macrocystic LM and one patient had combined disease.
345	The average age at first treatment was 6.8 y.
346	The most common presenting symptoms were abdominal distention, pain, infection, and anemia.
347	Preprocedural imaging was performed for all patients; median pretreatment volume was 1572.9 cm3 (range, 67.2-13,226.4).
348	LMs were accessed using ultrasound guidance and injected with opacified doxycycline.
349	Patients received a mean of 7.1 sclerotherapy injections.
350	Complications included intraperitoneal doxycycline extravasation (n = 1), managed conservatively, and LM infection (n = 1), treated with intravenous antibiotics and drainage.
351	One patient went on to surgical resection due to inability gain stable intracystic access; follow-up ultrasonography showed no recurrence.
352	Postprocedural imaging was available in n = 8.
353	Volume decreased by 96.7% after sclerotherapy.
354	The median remaining volume was 0 cm3 (range, 0-599.7) (P = 0.016).
355	Postsclerotherapy magnetic resonance imaging was obtained in n = 6, with complete resolution in 83.3%.
356	All patients had resolution of presenting symptoms.
357	Follow-up duration was 12.3 mo.
358	CONCLUSIONS-Initial results demonstrate that sclerotherapy is an effective and durable treatment for symptom resolution and volume reduction of abdominal LM.
359	Secukinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody neutralizing interleukin-17A, has been shown to have significant efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis.
360	Long-term (3-year) efficacy and safety of secukinumab in Japanese patients with moderate to severe psoriasis were evaluated in an extension study of a large phase 3 global study (SCULPTURE).
361	In the core study, 52 Japanese patients with 75% improvement of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI-75) response at week 12 were re-randomized to a fixed interval (FI; every 4 weeks) schedule and retreatment as needed (RAN), in which patients received placebo until start of relapse, at which time secukinumab was reinitiated.
362	Fifty Japanese patients completed the 52-week core study, and 47 patients entered the extension study with the same double-blind regimens up to week 152.
363	All patients in the secukinumab 300 mg FI and seven patients in 150 mg FI groups completed 3 years of treatment.
364	PASI-90 and -100 at the end of year 3 were achieved in 69.2% and 53.8%, respectively, in 300 mg FI and 42.9% and 42.9%, respectively, in 150 mg FI, indicating high sustained response in 300 mg FI.
365	Mean absolute PASI was continually low in 300 mg FI and numerically higher in 150 mg FI.
366	Dermatology Life Quality Index of 0/1 was maintained by approximately two-thirds of 300 mg FI patients, and all EuroQoL 5-Dimension Health Questionnaire domain measures were also improved.
367	FI dosing was consistently more efficacious than RAN.
368	The safety profile of secukinumab remained favorable, with no new safety concerns identified.
369	A newly modified electrode based on glassy carbon (GC) has been prepared and characterized electrochemically for application in electroanalytical chemistry.
370	In particular, a GC screen-printed electrode (SPE) has been modified with nanostructures, namely multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and TiO2 nanoparticles, and combined with a new generation of eco-friendly room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs).
371	The green RTILs here used are suitable for the immobilization of enzymes on the electrode surface and, additionally, facilitate the kinetics of electron transfer due to their intrinsic electrical conductivity.
372	Upon evaluation of these newly modified electrodes we found an improvement in terms of electrochemically active area (Aea) with respect to the electrodes we previously reported.
373	The modified SPEs were then used as substrates for the construction of two enzymatic biosensors for analytical applications: the first is an enzymatic biosensor based on alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) for the analysis of ethyl alcohol; the second biosensor is based on lipase enzyme and has been tested for the analysis and the classification of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO).
374	The performances of the here projected sensors appear comparable with biosensors having similar finalities.
375	It is here envisaged that such a kind of electrodes could represent the starting tool for the construction and the definition of new portable devices for screening and field analyses.
376	Skeletal muscle development and growth regulatory mechanism is the focus of both animal genetics and medicine.
377	The recent studies indicate that covalently closed circular RNAs (circRNAs) also play important role on muscle development through sequestering specific miRNAs.
378	The present study was conducted to determine the functional roles of circZfp609, a recently identified circRNA, in the regulation of myogenesis in mouse myoblast cell line (C2C12).
379	circZfp609 is predicted to has binding sites of miR-194-5p.
380	circZfp609 knockdown increased the expression of Myf5 and MyoG, which indicated that circZfp609 suppressed myogenic differentiation.
381	Via a luciferase screening assay, circZfp609 is observed to sponge to miR-194-5p with four potential binding sites.
382	Specifically, we show that circZfp609 can sponge miR-194-5p to sequester its inhibition on BCLAF1 so as to repress the myogenic differentiation.
383	Modulation of circZfp609 expression in muscle tissue may emerge as a potential target in breeding strategies attempting to control muscle development.
384	Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) from (meth)acrylates in nail aesthetics is a rising concern, namely in the occupational setting (1)(2).
385	Some technicians may have to abandon the job, as allergen avoidance is difficult (3).
386	Aiming to evaluate the capacity of gloves to protect from occupational ACD we performed patch tests with glove fragments placed between the allergens and patients' skin for different time periods, in patients with occupational ACD and positive patch tests to the (meth)acrylates and negative patch tests to gloves.

389	The Maquet Heater Unit 35 (HU35) is widely used to maintain patient body temperature during extracorporeal life support.
390	Water is used as a medium for heat transfer though it also provides a medium for the growth of pathogens.
391	Thus, the use of a heating unit presents a risk for transmission of water-borne pathogens in critically ill patients.
392	Recently, a Mycobacterium chimaera outbreak in cardiac surgery has been linked to the production of bioaerosols by heater-cooler devices.
393	Consequently, manufacturers have revised cleaning recommendations, with significant impact on staff, budget and environment.
394	Heterotrophic plate counts (HPC) and non-tuberculous mycobacterium growth were assessed following three disinfection processes over a 16-month period.
395	It was found that water quality was acceptable in HU35s when disinfecting with a lower concentration of Chloramine-T than currently recommended, provided exposure of the device to potential pathogens was minimised by the use of a 0.2 μm water filter.
396	BACKGROUND-Pandemic mortality rates in 1918 and in 2009 were highest among those with the lowest socioeconomic status (SES).
397	Despite this, low SES groups are not included in the list of groups prioritized for pandemic vaccination, and the ambition to reduce social inequality in health does not feature in international and national pandemic preparedness plans.
398	We describe plans for a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between SES and pandemic outcomes during the last five pandemics.
399	METHOD-The planned review will cover studies of pandemic influenza that report associations between morbidity, hospitalization, or mortality with socioeconomic factors such as education and income.
400	The review will include published studies in the English, Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish languages, regardless of geographical location.
401	Relevant records were identified through systematic literature searches in MEDLINE, Embase, Cinahl, SocIndex, Scopus, and Web of Science.
402	Reference lists of relevant known studies will be screened and experts in the field consulted in order to identify other additional sources.
403	Two investigators will independently screen and select studies, and discrepancies will be resolved through discussion until consensus is reached.
404	Covidence will be used.
405	Results will be summarized narratively and using three meta-analytic strategies: coefficients expressing the difference between the highest and lowest socioeconomic groups reported will be pooled using (a) fixed and random effects meta-analysis where studies involve similar outcome and exposure measures and (b) meta-regression where studies involve similar outcome measures.
406	In addition, we will attempt to use all reported estimates for SES differences in (c) a Bayesian meta-analysis to estimate the underlying SES gradient and how it differs by outcome and exposure measure.
407	DISCUSSION-This study will provide the first systematic review of research on the relation between SES and pandemic outcomes.
408	The findings will be relevant for health policy in helping to assess whether people of low socioeconomic status should be prioritized for vaccines in preparedness plans for pandemic influenza.
409	The review will also contribute to the research literature by providing pooled estimates of effect sizes as inputs into power calculations of future studies.
410	SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION-PROSPERO 87922.
411	Syntrophins are a family of proteins forming membrane-anchored scaffolds and serving as adaptors for various transmembrane and intracellular signaling molecules.
412	To understand the physiological roles of β1 syntrophin, one of the least characterized members, we generated mouse models to eliminate β1 syntrophin specifically in the endocrine or exocrine pancreas.
413	β1 syntrophin is dispensable for the morphology and function of insulin-producing β-cells.
414	However, mice with β1 syntrophin deletion in exocrine acinar cells exhibit increased severity of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis.
415	Reduced expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and dilation of acinar lumen are potential predisposition factors.
416	During the disease progression, a relative lack of autophagy is associated with deficiencies in both actin assembly and endoplasmic reticulum nucleation.
417	Our findings reveal for the first time that β1 syntrophin is a critical regulator of actin cytoskeleton and autophagy in pancreatic acinar cells, and is potently protective against cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis.
418	Salivary duct carcinoma (SDC) is a relatively rare highly aggressive salivary gland tumor.
419	Although SDC shows frequent lymph node and distant metastases, the presence of neoplastic cells in the pleural effusion is extremely rare.
420	In this report, we describe the first documented cytological case of metastatic SDC in cardiac and pleural effusions with immunocytochemical analyses for androgen receptor (AR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2.
421	A 52-year-old Japanese male developed cardiac tamponade and respiratory discomfort after surgery and chemo-radiation therapy for SDC of the right submandibular gland.
422	Aspiration of the cardiac and pleural effusions was performed.
423	The Papanicolaou-stained cytological specimens of cardiac and pleural effusions showed that numerous small ball-like or papillary structures were present in an inflammatory background.
424	The neoplastic cells had rich granular cytoplasm and large round to oval nuclei containing conspicuous nucleoli.
425	Immunocytochemical analyses clearly demonstrated positivity for AR and strong membranous expression of HER2 in the neoplastic cells.
426	Accordingly, a cytodiagnosis of metastatic SDC was made.
427	Recently, HER2-targeted or AR deprivation therapy have been introduced for patients with SDC, therefore, determination of expression profiles of AR and HER2 may be crucial for developing a treatment strategy for patients with metastatic SDC.
428	According to the results of the present report, immunocytochemical analyses for AR and HER2 in the effusion specimens may be useful for determination of a treatment strategy for patients with metastatic SDC.
429	RATIONALE-Mesenteric fibromatosis is a rare benign neoplasm with a tendency to spread and recur locally, without metastasis.
430	It may present with a wide spectrum of clinical features; however, onset as a perforation is extremely rare.
431	PATIENT CONCERNS-The present patient was an 18-year-old female with a 10-hour history of increasing abdominal pain that arose suddenly with nausea and vomiting.
432	She had experienced an appendectomy 2 years before this admission.
433	DIAGNOSES-A gastrointestinal perforation was initially suspected on the basis of complaints and physical examination.
434	The patient was thoroughly investigated for further diagnosis.
435	Computed tomography showed a large well-defined intra-abdominal mass measuring 7.1 × 6.7 × 5.9 cm in the right lower quadrant, with adjacent small intestine compression and free intraperitoneal air.
436	Then, the patient underwent a laparotomy.
437	Finally, postoperative pathology and immunohistochemistry confirmed mesenteric fibromatosis, with a consecutive perforation from ileum to the bottom of tumor.
438	INTERVENTIONS-The patient has been treated by a resection of the mass with the adhesive small intestine, without chemotherapy or radiotherapy postoperatively.
439	OUTCOMES-The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery.
440	Three months after surgery, the patient reviewed the colonoscopy, no intestinal polyps were noted.
441	The present case has been followed up for 17 months without tumor recurrence.
442	LESSONS-Our case illustrates another possible cause of acute abdominal pain.
443	Although rare, treating physicians should maintain a high suspicion index while managing a patient with an abdominal mass and pain.
444	Close follow-up is essential because of the high incidence of local tumor recurrence.
445	A novel bifunctional thiophene-based Schiff base TS as a colorimetric and fluorescent turn-on sensor for rapid and simultaneous detection of Al3+ and Zn2+ ions with high selectivity and sensitivity has been developed.
446	The sensor shows remarkable fluorescence enhancement response for Al3+ and Zn2+ over a broad pH range with good anti-interference capability, which accompanied with an obvious color change easily detected by naked eyes.
447	Sensor TS can detect as low as 3.7 × 10-9 M for Al3+ and 3.0 × 10-8 M for Zn2+, whereas respective association constants are 1.16 × 104 M-1 and 2.08 × 104 M-1.
448	With the help of fluorescence titration and Job's plot, the stoichiometric ratio of TS with Al3+/Zn2+ was determined to be 1:1.
449	The sensing mechanism of sensor TS with Al3+/Zn2+ based on the chelation-enhanced fluorescence (CHEF) was analyzed in detail through 1H NMR titration, FTIR, HRMS and DFT studies.
450	Moreover, sensor TS has been applied to the detection of Al3+ and Zn2+ in real environmental water and food samples as well as the filter paper-based test strips.
451	Furthermore, sensor TS has good cell-permeability and can be used to selectively sense intracellular Al3+ and Zn2+ by bioimaging.
452	Executive functions (EFs) have been identified as processes in the ability to select and apply adaptive strategies for coping with stress.
453	This study compares executive functioning, short-term memory, and coping in a sample of young and older adults with no prior diagnosis of depression and with normal cognitive function ( N = 216).
454	The study collected measures of depression, EFs, short-term memory, and coping.
455	Young participants scored higher than older adults on EFs and short-term memory.
456	Moreover, in young adults, there was a prevalence of avoidance coping strategies.
457	Scores on depressive symptomatology were found to be related to avoidant coping strategies.
458	Older adults with higher score on inhibition used less avoidant coping.
459	Thus, it seems that executive deficits might contribute to depression, as they affect processes for coping with stress.
460	This finding may have implications for the role of EFs and coping in psychological well-being and successful adaptation of individuals to stressful situations.
461	PURPOSE-To investigate pain levels and factors that are predictive of pain for mechanically ventilated patients during rest and during routine nursing procedures.
462	MATERIAL AND METHODS-Pain levels were assessed using Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS) and physiological measures among 247 mechanically ventilated patients.
463	RESULTS-At rest, 33.2% of patients suffered pain, with a BPS > 3; of these, 10% presented significant pain levels (BPS ≥ 5).
464	Variables that correspondingly predicted resting pain were age (β = -0.010, p < 0.001), sedation score (β = -0.153, p < 0.01), and method of ventilation (β = -0.281, p = 0.021).
465	During the procedures, 90% of patients suffered pain, with a median BPS of 6 (IQR: 4-8), and 83% of patients experienced significant pain levels.
466	Age (β = -0.022, p = 0.001), sedation score (β = -0.355, p < 0.001), receiving sedation and/or analgesia in last hour (β = 0.483, p = 0.
467	01), resting pain levels (β = -0.742, p < 0.001) and the type of painful procedure (β = -0.906, p < 0.001) were significant predictors of procedural pain.
468	CONCLUSIONS-Many mechanically ventilated patients suffer resting and procedural pain.
469	Many variables were found to play a role.
470	Clinicians need to consider these variables and intervene to decrease pain among patients at risk.
471	This study evaluated the effect of a multidisciplinary treatment program for children with obesity (OB) on motor competence, executive functioning (EF), and brain structure.
472	Nineteen children with OB (7-11 years), who attended a multidisciplinary treatment program consisting of diet restriction, cognitive behavioral therapy, and physical activity, were compared with an age-matched control group of 24 children with a healthy weight (HW), who did not follow any treatment.
473	For both groups, anthropometric measurements and tests of motor competence and EF were administered twice, with 5 months between pretest and posttest.
474	Additionally, children's brain structure was assessed by performing a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan at the pretest and posttest, which included a T1 anatomical scan, diffusion MRI scan, and magnetization transfer imaging scan.
475	Compared to HW controls, children with OB lost a considerable amount of their body mass (p ≤ .001) and significantly improved their balance skills (p ≤ .001), while no transfer effects of the program were observed for EF.
476	Furthermore, the program resulted in a significant increase in total (p ≤ .001) and cerebellar (p ≤ .001) gray matter volume in children with OB, while no change was observed in the HW controls.
477	Finally, only weak to moderate (nonsignificant) correlations could be observed between structural brain alterations, weight-related changes, and behavioral improvements.
478	Altogether, this is the first longitudinal study showing behavioral and structural brain alterations in response to a multidisciplinary weight loss program for children with OB.
479	Our findings support the need for multidimensional intervention (and prevention) measures for children with OB to deal with this multifactorial health problem.
480	In critical care, intensivists are required to continuously monitor high dimensional vital signs and lab measurements to detect and diagnose acute patient conditions.
481	This has always been a challenging task.
482	In this study, we propose a novel self-correcting deep learning prediction approach to address this challenge.
483	We focus on an example of the prediction of acute kidney injury (AKI).
484	Compared with the existing models, our method has a number of distinct features: we utilized the accumulative data of patients in ICU; we developed a self-correcting mechanism that feeds errors from the previous predictions back into the network; we also proposed a regularization method that takes into account not only the model's prediction error on the label but also its estimation errors on the input data.
485	This mechanism is applied in both regression and classification tasks.
486	We compared the performance of our proposed method with the conventional deep learning models on two real-world clinical datasets and demonstrated that our proposed model constantly outperforms these baseline models.
487	In particular, the proposed model achieved area under ROC curve at 0.893 on the MIMIC III dataset, and 0.871 on the Philips eICU dataset.
488	Chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs), a contaminant of water and food supplies, is associated with many adverse health effects.
489	A notable feature of iAs metabolism is sequential methylation reactions which produce mono- and di-methylated arsenicals that can contain arsenic in either the trivalent (III) or pentavalent (V) valence states.
490	Because methylated arsenicals containing trivalent arsenic are more potent toxicants than their pentavalent counterparts, the ability to distinguish between the +3 and +5 valence states is a crucial property for physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models of arsenicals to possess if they are to be of use in risk assessment.
491	Unfortunately, current analytic techniques for quantifying arsenicals in tissues disrupt the valence state; hence, pharmacokinetic studies in animals, used for model calibration, only reliably provide data on the sum of the +3 and +5 valence forms of a given metabolite.
492	In this paper we show how mathematical modeling can be used to overcome this obstacle and present a PBPK model for the dimethylated metabolite of iAs, which exists as either dimethylarsinous acid, (CH3)2AsIIIOH (abbreviated DMAIII) or dimethylarsinic acid, (CH3)2AsV(O)OH (abbreviated DMAV).
493	The model distinguishes these two forms and sets a lower bound on how much of an organ's DMA burden is present in the more reactive and toxic trivalent valence state.
494	We conjoin the PBPK model to a simple model for DMAIII-induced oxidative stress in liver and use this extended model to predict cytotoxicity in liver in response to the high oral dose of DMAV.
495	The model incorporates mechanistic details derived from in vitro studies and is iteratively calibrated with lumped-valence-state PK data for intravenous or oral dosing with DMAV.
496	Model formulation leads us to predict that orally administered DMAV undergoes extensive reduction in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to the more toxic trivalent DMAIII.
497	Reversible inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase are increasingly applied in the Alzheimer's disease therapy.
498	Their determination with biosensors requires special attention to the enzyme immobilization due to importance of electrostatic and steric factors affecting accessibility of the active site to the substrate and inhibitor present simultaneously.
499	In this work, polyelectrolyte complexes have been assembled from electrochemically inactive components with implementation of acetylcholinesterase from electric eel.
500	The influence of the complex components and enzyme position on the assembling efficiency was explored using surface plasmon resonance and kinetic parameters of the enzyme with amperometry with Co phtalocyanine mediator.
501	The biosensor developed showed robust response toward donepezil and berberine with limit of detection of 0.46 and 70 nM, respectively, within 1 min after inhibitor addition.
502	The sensitivity of determination coincides or is better than characteristics of biosensors based on covalently attached AChE described in the literature.
503	The biosensor was tested on the example of drug determination in spiked samples of artificial urine (recovery 103% for 0.6 nM donepezil and 110% for 0.1 μM berberine).
504	BACKGROUND-Medial epicondylitis and lateral epicondylitis are among the most common elbow pathologies affecting people aged between 40 and 50 years.
505	Although epicondylitis is often a self-limiting condition that improves with conservative treatment, the condition can be difficult to eradicate.
506	The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections and ultrasound-guided percutaneous tenotomy (Tenex) for the treatment of medial or lateral epicondylitis.
507	Our hypothesis was that the Tenex procedure would not be inferior to PRP injections in the treatment of medial or lateral epicondylitis.
508	METHODS-In this retrospective review, 62 of 75 patients were available for contact via phone and e-mail to complete post-procedure patient-reported outcome surveys.
509	Subjective assessment of pain and function included a visual analog scale for pain; the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire; and the EuroQol-5D questionnaire.
510	The inclusion criteria included age of 18 years or older and previous failure of nonoperative treatment.
511	RESULTS-The average ages in the PRP and Tenex groups were 47 years and 51 years, respectively.
512	The PRP cohort (n = 32) included 10 female and 22 male patients, whereas the Tenex cohort (n = 30) included 12 female and 18 male patients.
513	The PRP and Tenex groups both demonstrated clinical and statistical improvement in visual analog scale pain scores; Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scores; and EuroQol-5D scores.
514	No statistically significant difference was found between the 2 treatment modalities.
515	CONCLUSION-The PRP and Tenex procedures were both successful in producing clinically and statistically significant improvements in pain, function, and quality of life.
516	For electrochemical biosensors, just like a computer, the modularization and coordinated operation of different components will facilitate the development of versatile biosensors and effectively reduce costs.
517	However, the efficient synergy between different modules is always difficult.
518	It would be a beneficial way to construct the multi-functional module.
519	In this work, a three-dimensional gold nanoparticles/ferrocene/liposome cluster (GFLC) is fabricated and explored as a building block for the fabrication of an electrochemical biosensor, in which gold nanoparticles, ferrocene and liposome cluster work as a signal amplification component, a signal output component and a molecular recognition component, respectively.
520	With the synergy of multi-functions, GFLC has been successfully applied for electrochemical analysis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in food samples.
521	LPS can be linearly assayed in the range from 2 × 10-9 μg/mL to 8 μg/mL with a detection limit of 0.51 × 10-10 μg/mL.
522	In view of the favorable modularization effect, GFLC shows a great potential in the development of electrochemical biosensor with considerable versatility and cost-efficiency.
523	Methanol is used in transesterification reaction for biodiesel production, being an important quality parameter to evaluate the purity of the final product.
524	Methanol concentrations higher than 0.20% (m/m) reduce the biofuel efficiency.
525	The Brazilian, United States, and European standards recommend the reference method based on gas chromatography with flame ionization detection, which involves a time-consuming procedure and requires high-cost equipment.
526	In this work, it is proposed a simple and low cost spot test based on digital images acquired with a smartphone camera for the determination of methanol in biodiesel.
527	The procedure was based on the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde and subsequent reaction with Schiff reagent, resulting in a violet product.
528	Analytical signals were based on the reflected radiation measured on the G channel (RGB system), which refers to the complementary color of the reaction product.
529	Linear responses were obtained within 20-500 mg kg-1 and 500-2000 mg kg-1 methanol for 600 and 150 µL of sample aqueous extracts, respectively.
530	The coefficient of variation (n = 10) and the limit of detection (99.7% confidence level) were estimated as 4.8% and 10 mg kg-1 (600 µL of sample), respectively.
531	The procedure requires only 75 µg of potassium permanganate, 6 mg of oxalic acid, and 1.5 mg of p-rosaniline and generates ca.
532	1.2 mL of residue per determination.
533	The results agreed with those obtained by the reference procedure at the 95% confidence level, demonstrating that the proposed method is an alternative for routine analysis of the biofuel.
534	Multiple environmental stressors caused by global warming influence the regulation of proteins involved in various biological processes in aquatic organisms.
535	As an important component of the marine ecosystem, sea cucumber is a suitable echinoderm species for researching stress responses.
536	In this study, we have investigated the proteomic response of respiratory trees in the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus, challenged with environmental stresses by using the iTRAQ technique.
537	Results showed that 262, 155 and 433 proteins were differentially regulated in response to heat, hypoxia, and heat plus hypoxia, respectively.
538	Expression of key genes and proteins were measured by real-time PCR and western blot to validate the accuracy of the proteome files.
539	Results showed that the interaction between these two stressors has an additive effect at the proteome level.
540	Proteins involved in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolic processes were largely induced by heat while repressed by hypoxia.
541	Exposure to multiple climate change stressors caused several proteins involved in lipid metabolic progress to be down-regulated and lipid catabolic processes were induced.
542	Additionally, hypoxia and the combined stress induced proteins involved in iron homeostasis.
543	ATP synthesis and gluconeogenesis were induced under heat and the combined stress, while ATP and glycogen synthesis were depressed under hypoxia.
544	Proteins related with immune and defense response were largely induced and protein synthesis ability was depressed under all three stresses.
545	Thus, sea cucumber may adopt different strategies to cope with varied environmental stress, and the situation in heat group is more similar with the combined treatment than hypoxia group.
546	These proteomic changes in response to high-temperature and low-oxygen levels may provide insights into the defense strategies of sea cucumber in response to global climate changes.
547	SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: The study focused on comparative quantitative proteomics on Apostichopus japonicus respiratory tree using iTRAQ in responses to multiple climate change stressors: heat, hypoxia and the combined stress.
548	Data showed that A. japonicus can have an acute reaction in diverse biological pathways to both individual and interacting environmental stress, including substance metabolism, signal transduction, protein synthesis, immune response and energy production.
549	Results indicated that sea cucumber adopted different strategies to cope with varied environmental stress, and the interaction between these two stressors has an additive effect at the proteome level.
550	These results offer insight into the molecular regulation of A. japonicus to multiple environmental stress and reveal possible molecular events in sea cucumber under climate changes.
551	The understanding of adaptive variation under global climate changes in aquatic organisms could be improved.
552	We performed a molecular survey for Cytauxzoon felis infection in 311 domestic cats in Yunnan Province, China, in 2016 and found a prevalence of 21.5%.
553	C. felis infection in domestic and wild cats in other provinces should be investigated to determine parasite prevalence and genetic diversity among cats throughout China.
554	Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a critical endogenous signaling molecule, is widely involved in many physiological processes.
555	Endoplasmic reticulum, an important organelle with a sac-like structure, plays crucial roles in maintaining the normal function of cells.
556	Accordingly, monitoring the H2S levels in endoplasmic reticulum is of great importance.
557	Herein, we have developed an endoplasmic reticulum-targetable fluorescent probe, ER-CN, for H2S detection.
558	ER-CN features excellent sensing properties, such as high sensitivity and selectivity.
559	In addition, ER-CN exhibits low cytotoxicity and a fine endoplasmic reticulum targeting property (with a Pearson's colocalization coefficient of 0.95).
560	Significantly, visualization of H2S in the endoplasmic reticulum of living HeLa cells by using ER-CN was successfully realized.
561	BACKGROUND-Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumour cerebri syndrome (PTCS), is characterized by the presence of signs and symptoms of raised intracranial pressure without evidence of any intracranial structural cause and with normal cerebrospinal fluid microscopy and biochemistry.
562	Obesity, various systemic diseases and endocrine conditions, and a number of medications are known to be risk factors for PTCS.
563	The medications commonly associated with PTCS are amiodarone, antibiotics, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, growth hormone, oral contraceptives, vitamin A analogues, lithium, phenytoin, NSAIDs, leuprolide acetate, and some neuroleptic drugs.
564	In relation to antibiotics, quinolones may cause intracranial hypertension, and most reported cases of quinolone-induced intracranial hypertension were associated with nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, or pefloxacin.
565	Literature reports of levofloxacin-induced PTCS are rare.
566	Some authors recently hypothesized that Mycoplasma pneumoniae may trigger PTCS.
567	CASE PRESENTATION-We report on a 14-year-old overweight White Italian boy who suffered headache, diplopia, and severe bilateral papilloedema after a Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, exacerbated on levofloxacin intake.
568	A spontaneous improvement in headache and a reduction in diplopia was seen during hospitalisation.
569	Oral acetazolamide therapy led to the regression of papilloedema in about five months.
570	No permanent eye damage has been observed in our patient to date.
571	CONCLUSIONS-PTCS pathophysiology may be multifactorial and its specific features and severity may be a consequence of both constitutional and acquired factors interacting synergistically.
572	It may be useful for paediatricians to know that some antibiotics may have the potential to precipitate PTCS in patients who already have an increased CSF pressure due to a transitory imbalanced CSF circulation caused by infections such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, with headache being the first and most sensitive, but also the least specific, symptom.
573	This paper proposes a robust framework for the security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) of generating units, in the presence of lithium-ion battery energy storage units, using the information-gap decision theory (IGDT) technique.
574	In the suggested model, the degradation cost of the battery storage units has been considered in the objective function as a highly influencing factor in the operation of such storage units.
575	The framework is independent of probability density functions or membership of sets and enables the system operator to adjust the conservatism of the operating strategy (between overconservative and reckless) against the load demand uncertainty.
576	In this respect, the SCUC model has been presented within a day-ahead scheduling problem on the hourly basis using mixed-integer linear programming.
577	Finally, the proposed framework has been simulated on a typical 6-bus test system as well as IEEE 24-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems to verify the efficiency and the effectiveness of the model using the IGDT technique.
578	This study investigated the molecular and phenotypic characteristics of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, and identified the risk factors underlying its acquisition.
579	We evaluated K. pneumoniae isolated in Nagasaki University Hospital between January 2009 and June 2015.
580	The presence of carbapenemase genes and plasmid characteristics were investigated.
581	We performed multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and generated a dendrogram based on the results of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) for carbapenemase-producing strains.
582	We also performed a case-control study of patients.
583	Of the 88 K. pneumoniae strains that showed minimum inhibitory concentration ≥1 μg/mL for imipenem and/or meropenem, and that were available from our bacterial collection, 18 had the IMP-type carbapenemase gene, all of which were IMP-1 according to sequencing analysis.
584	Strains included seven different sequence types (STs), of which the most common was ST1471.
585	A dendrogram showed the significant similarity of some strains with relationships in PFGE patterns, STs, and the wards in which they were isolated.
586	Plasmid incompatibility group was similar among the IMP-1 producers.
587	Regarding risk factors, multivariate analysis showed that liver disease and previous uses of carbapenems and anti-fungal drugs were significant factors for the acquisition of IMP-1-producing strains.
588	Our results demonstrate that IMP-1 is a major carbapenemase produced by K. pneumoniae.
589	The PFGE results indicated the possibility of transmission in the hospital.
590	The identified risk factors should be considered for appropriate antibiotic therapy and infection-control measures.
591	RNA-DNA hybrids are common in chromosomal DNA.
592	Persistent RNA-DNA hybrids result in replication fork stress, DNA breaks, and neurological disorders in humans.
593	During replication, Okazaki fragment synthesis relies on frequent RNA primer placement, providing one of the most prominent forms of covalent RNA-DNA strands in vivo The mechanism of Okazaki fragment maturation, which involves RNA removal and subsequent DNA replacement, in bacteria lacking RNase HI remains unclear.
594	In this work, we reconstitute repair of a linear model Okazaki fragment in vitro using purified recombinant enzymes from Bacillus subtilis We show that RNase HII and HIII are capable of incision on Okazaki fragments in vitro and both enzymes show mild stimulation by single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB).
595	We also show that RNase HIII and DNA polymerase I provide the primary pathway for Okazaki fragment maturation in vitro Further, we show that YpcP is a 5' to 3' nuclease that can act upon a wide-variety of RNA and DNA-containing substrates and shows preference for degrading RNA in model Okazaki fragments.
596	Together, our work shows that RNase HIII and DNA polymerase I provide the primary pathway for Okazaki fragment maturation while YpcP also contributes to the removal of RNA from an Okazaki fragment in vitro IMPORTANCE All cells are required to resolve the different types of RNA-DNA hybrids that form in vivo When RNA-DNA hybrids persist, cells experience an increase in mutation rate and problems with DNA replication.
597	Okazaki fragment synthesis on the lagging strand requires an RNA primer to begin synthesis of each fragment.
598	The mechanism of RNA removal from Okazaki fragments remains unknown in bacteria that lack RNase HI.
599	We examined Okazaki fragment processing in vitro and show that RNase HIII in conjunction with DNA polymerase I represent the most efficient repair pathway.
600	We also assess the contribution of YpcP and demonstrate that YpcP is a 5' to 3' exonuclease that prefers RNA substrates with activity on Okazaki and flap substrates in vitro.
601	In this paper, we describe a simple and indirect method to evaluate the kinetics of the optical properties for biological tissues under optical clearing treatments.
602	We use the theoretical formalism in this method to process experimental data obtained from colorectal muscle samples to evaluate and characterize the dehydration and refractive index matching mechanisms.
603	A water-soluble curcumin lysinate incorporated into hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (NDS27) has been developed and shown anti-inflammatory properties but no comparative study has been made in parallel with its parent molecule, curcumin on polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) involved in inflammation.
604	The effect of NDS27, its excipients (hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and lysine), curcumin lysinate and curcumin were compared on the release of superoxide anion by PMNs using a chemiluminescence assay and on the enzymatic activity of MPO.
605	It was shown that curcumin and NDS27 exhibit similar inhibition activities on superoxide anion release by stimulated PMNs but also on MPO peroxidase and halogenation activities.
606	The action mechanism of curcumin and NDS27 on the MPO activity was refined by stopped-flow and docking analyses.
607	We demonstrate that both curcumin and NDS27 are reversible inhibitors of MPO by acting as excellent electron donors for redox intermediate Compound I (∼107 M-1 s-1) but not for Compound II (∼103 M-1 s-1) in the peroxidase cycle of the enzyme, thereby trapping the enzyme in the Compound II state.
608	Docking calculations show that curcumin is able to enter the enzymatic pocket of MPO and bind to the heme cavity by π-stacking and formation of hydrogen bonds involving substituents from both aromatic rings.
609	Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin is too bulky to enter MPO channel leading to the binding site suggesting a full release of curcumin from the cyclodextrin thereby allowing its full access to the active site of MPO.
610	In conclusion, the hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin of NDS27 enhances curcumin solubilization without affecting its antioxidant capacity and inhibitory activity on MPO.
611	BACKGROUND-Determining the underlying etiology of dementia can be challenging.
612	Computer-based clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have the potential to provide objective comparison of data and assist clinicians.
613	OBJECTIVES-To assess the diagnostic impact of a CDSS, the PredictND tool, for differential diagnosis of dementia in memory clinics.
614	METHOD-In this prospective multicenter study, we recruited 779 patients with either subjective cognitive decline (n=252), mild cognitive impairment (n=219) or any type of dementia (n=274) and followed them for minimum 12 months.
615	Based on all available patient baseline data (demographics, neuropsychological tests, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and MRI visual and computed ratings) the PredictND tool provides a comprehensive overview and analysis of the data with a likelihood index for five diagnostic groups; Alzheimer´s disease, vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia and subjective cognitive decline.
616	At baseline, a clinician defined an etiological diagnosis and confidence in the diagnosis, first without and subsequently with the PredictND tool.
617	The follow-up diagnosis was used as reference diagnosis.
618	RESULTS-In total, 747 patients completed the follow-up visits (53% female, 69±10 years).
619	The etiological diagnosis changed in 13% of all cases when using the PredictND tool, but the diagnostic accuracy did not change significantly.
620	Confidence in the diagnosis, measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS, 0-100%), increased (∆VAS=3.0%, p<0.0001), especially in correctly changed diagnoses (∆VAS=7.2%, p=0.0011).
621	CONCLUSION-Adding the PredictND tool to the diagnostic evaluation affected the diagnosis and increased clinicians' confidence in the diagnosis indicating that CDSSs could aid clinicians in differential diagnosis of dementia.
622	Social cognition is widely regarded as an essential skill with which to understand the social world.
623	Despite this, the role that social cognition plays in outcome, and whether deficits are remediable after traumatic brain injury (TBI), are not yet well known.
624	The current review examines the construct of social cognition and presents a conceptual biopsychosocial model with which to understand the social cognitive process.
625	This is related to the literature on social cognitive deficits in TBI and we discuss relevant treatment developments to date within this population.
626	We then review social cognition treatment programmes researched in other clinical populations in order to advise and inform approaches for those living with TBI.
627	Whilst treatments have focused on emotion perception skills in the TBI literature, programmes developed for other clinical populations have had broader targets, focusing on Theory of Mind skills and/or modifying interpretational cognitive biases.
628	Moreover, they have largely proven to be efficacious.
629	Programmes that are contextualised, collaborative, and experiential seem optimal in enabling generalisation relevant to individuals' everyday social lives.
630	We argue that there is therefore scope to improve the evidence-based social cognitive treatment options available for those with TBI, taking into account specific adaptations necessary for this population.
631	In 2015, the OIE and FAO launched a global eradication programme for Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR).
632	Vaccination is a major component of this strategy yet the costs of implementing a campaign are unknown or based on assumptions without field-based verification necessary for effective economic planning.
633	This study used experiences of attending four PPR vaccination campaigns in Ethiopia to estimate various cost components in pastoral and mixed-crop livestock systems.
634	These components included: cost of vaccine; vaccine transport from the producer to the local storage facility; storage of vaccine at the local facility; delivery and administration of vaccine in the field; opportunity cost of farmer's time to attend the vaccination; co-ordination of vaccination campaign; publicity and mobilisation costs; vaccine wastage from missed shots and vaccine discard.
635	The overall cost of vaccination was approximately 6 Ethiopian birr (ETB) or US$0.2 per animal in the mixed-crop livestock system compared to approximately 3ETB or US$0.1 in pastoral areas.
636	The relative importance of cost components varied in the two systems with farmer time being the largest contributor in the mixed-crop livestock system while field delivery was the main cost in pastoral areas.
637	Notable vaccine wastage was observed particularly through missed shots that were typically between 0 and 10% but as high as 33%.
638	At the national level, the output of the stochastic model showed the cost of vaccination to be highly variable particularly in the mixed-crop livestock system.
639	These results highlight the importance of doing economic assessments of vaccination campaigns and issues that may be compromising efficiency of delivery and vaccine coverage.
640	It is recommended that the framework be used for further economic evaluations of vaccination for PPR and other livestock diseases particularly when limited public or donor funds are being used, and that the approach be expanded to other countries and regions.
641	For the aim of simultaneously performing the enantioseparation and determination of the trace enantiomers in plasma samples, enantioseparation by HPLC using five kinds of chiral stationary phases were initially investigated.
642	But unfortunately, enantioseparation could not be detected in reversed mobile phase mode with all the five columns.
643	For this reason, two simple, economical and highly efficient online preconcentration methods, large volume sample stacking and sweeping (LVSS-sweeping) and cation-selective exhaustive injection and sweeping (CSEI-sweeping) both followed by the cyclodextrin modified electrokinetic chromatography (CDEKC) were examined in the present work.
644	Parameters affecting the enantioseparation and enhancement efficiency of these two injection modes were monitored in detail, and migration order of the two enantiomers was identified by circular dichroism (CD) and HPLC.
645	Upon optimization, two enantiomers were best separated with the improvement of sensitivity reaching 160-fold and 4000-fold respectively for LVSS-sweeping and CSEI-sweeping comparing with the normal CDEKC separation.
646	Then the optimal condition of CSEI-sweeping-CDEKC was validated and showed high sensitivity (10 ng/mL for lower limit of quantification, LLOQ), satisfactory accuracy (96.8-111.6%) and precision (relative standard deviation, RSD within 9.4%).
647	This demonstrated it to be a suitable strategy for the rapid enantioselective determination and quantitative analysis of pheniramine enantiomers in plasma samples.
648	Therefore, the method was further applied in the enantiomeric analysis of pheniramine in rat pharmacokinetics and plasma protein binding investigations.
649	Stereoselectivity in pharmacokinetics as well as plasma protein binding were observed, suggesting that the stereoselective protein binding might be responsible for the stereoselectivity in pharmacokinetics.
650	We introduce a category of vector spaces modelling full propositional linear logic, similar to probabilistic coherence spaces and to Koethe sequences spaces.
651	Its objects are rigged sequences spaces, Banach spaces of sequences, with norms defined from pairing with finite sequences, and morphisms are bounded linear maps, continuous in a suitable topology.
652	The main interest of the work is that our model gives a realization of the free linear logic exponentials construction.
653	Accurate determination of the genetic diversity present in the HIV quasispecies is critical for the development of a preventative vaccine: in particular, little is known about viral genetic diversity for the second type of HIV, HIV-2.
654	A better understanding of HIV-2 biology is relevant to the HIV vaccine field because a substantial proportion of infected people experience long-term viral control, and prior HIV-2 infection has been associated with slower HIV-1 disease progression in coinfected subjects.
655	The majority of traditional and next-generation sequencing methods have relied on target amplification prior to sequencing, introducing biases that may obscure the true signals of diversity in the viral population.
656	Additionally, target enrichment through PCR requires a priori sequence knowledge, which is lacking for HIV-2.
657	Therefore, a target enrichment free method of library preparation would be valuable for the field.
658	We applied an RNA shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq) method without PCR amplification to cultured viral stocks and patient plasma samples from HIV-2-infected individuals.
659	Libraries generated from total plasma RNA were analyzed with a two-step pipeline: (i) de novo genome assembly, followed by (ii) read remapping.
660	By this approach, whole-genome sequences were generated with a 28× to 67× mean depth of coverage.
661	Assembled reads showed a low level of GC bias, and comparison of the genome diversities at the intrahost level showed low diversity in the accessory gene vpx in all patients.
662	Our study demonstrates that RNA-Seq is a feasible full-genome de novo sequencing method for blood plasma samples collected from HIV-2-infected individuals.IMPORTANCE An accurate picture of viral genetic diversity is critical for the development of a globally effective HIV vaccine.
663	However, sequencing strategies are often complicated by target enrichment prior to sequencing, introducing biases that can distort variant frequencies, which are not easily corrected for in downstream analyses.
664	Additionally, detailed a priori sequence knowledge is needed to inform robust primer design when employing PCR amplification, a factor that is often lacking when working with tropical diseases localized in developing countries.
665	Previous work has demonstrated that direct RNA shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq) can be used to circumvent these issues for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and norovirus.
666	We applied RNA-Seq to total RNA extracted from HIV-2 blood plasma samples, demonstrating the applicability of this technique to HIV-2 and allowing us to generate a dynamic picture of genetic diversity over the whole genome of HIV-2 in the context of low-bias sequencing.
667	A novel coding scheme for exact repair-regenerating codes is presented in this paper.
668	The codes proposed in this paper can trade between the repair bandwidth of nodes (number of downloaded symbols from each surviving node in a repair process) and the required storage overhead of the system.
669	These codes work for general system parameters $(n,k,d)$, the total number of nodes, the number of nodes suffice for data recovery, and the number of helper nodes in a repair process, respectively.
670	The proposed construction offers a unified scheme to develop exact-repair regenerating codes for the entire trade-off, including the MBR and MSR points.
671	We conjecture that the new storage-vs.-bandwidth trade-off achieved by the proposed codes is optimum.
672	Some other key features of this code include: the construction is linear, the required field size is only $\Theta(n)$, and the (unnormalized) code parameters (and in particular sub-packetization level) is at most $(d-k+1)^k$, which is independent of the number of the parity nodes.
673	Moreover, the proposed repair mechanism is \emph{helper-independent}, that is the data sent from each helper only depends on the identity of the helper and failed nodes, but independent from the identity of other helper nodes participating in the repair process.
674	BACKGROUND-Conflicting data exist regarding the relationship between dual infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
675	We assessed dual infection of HBV and HCV with the levels of blood glucose and development of DM.
676	METHODS-A total of 9621 participants in a community-based study were enrolled from 18 towns in Maoli county of Taiwan.
677	Blood samples were collected and tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies (HBsAb), antibodies against hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) and fasting plasma glucose.
678	DM was defined as fasting plasma glucose≥126 mg per 100 ml.
679	RESULTS-Only 0.7% of total participants had HBV/HCV coinfection.
680	The prevalence of HBV and HCV monoinfection were 9.9  and 5.7%, respectively.
681	Adjusted blood glucose levels and development risk of T2DM (odds ratio [OR], 2.55; p<0.001) were significantly high among HBV/HCV coinfection group using multivariate linear regression adjusted for age, gender, education, race and BMI.
682	Furthermore, using multivariate logistic regression models adjusted for covariates, HCV mono-and HBV/ HCV coinfection significantly increased on blood glucose levels.
683	CONCLUSIONS-Our study shows HBV/HCV coinfection was significantly correlated with blood glucose levels.
684	A significant proportion (28%) of participants with HBV/HCV coinfection developed T2DM.
685	Although the precise mechanisms of dual positive infection of HBV and HCV are unclear, there is increasing evidence that dual infection of HCV and HBV is strongly associated with the development of T2DM.
686	OBJECTIVES-Surgical reconstruction of tracheal disease has expanded to include bioengineering and three dimensional (3D) printing.
687	This pilot study investigates the viability of introducing a living functional tracheal replacement graft in a rabbit animal model.
688	METHODS-Seven New Zealand White rabbits were enrolled and six completed participation (one intraoperative mortality).
689	Tracheal replacement grafts were created by impregnating 3D printed biodegradable polycaprolactone (PCL) tracheal scaffolds with rabbit tracheal hyaline chondrocytes.
690	2 cm of native trachea was resected and the tracheal replacement graft implanted.
691	Subjects were divided into two equal groups (n = 3) that differed in their time of harvest following implantation (three or six weeks).
692	Tracheal specimens were analyzed with intraluminal telescopic visualization and histopathology.
693	RESULTS-The two groups did not significantly differ in histopathology or intraluminal diameter.
694	All sections wherein the implant telescoped over native trachea (anastomotic ends) contained adequate hyaline cartilage formation (i.e.
695	chondrocytes within lacuna, surrounding extracellular matrix, and strong Safranin O staining).
696	Furthermore, the PCL scaffold was surrounded by a thin layer of fibrous tissue.
697	All areas without membranous coverage contained inadequate or immature cartilage formation with inflammation.
698	The average intraluminal stenosis was 83.4% (range 34.2-95%).
699	CONCLUSIONS-We report normal cartilage growth in a tracheal replacement graft when chondrocytes are separated from the tracheal lumen by an intervening membrane.
700	When no such membrane exists there is a propensity for inflammation and stenosis.
701	These findings are important for future construction and implantation of tracheal replacement grafts.
702	LEVEL OF EVIDENCE-Not applicable: this is an in vivo animal trial.
703	In 2018, new recommendations about the prevention of falls and fractures emphasized the benefits from exercise and from multimodal prevention programs but did not endorse any more vitamin D supplementation for falls prevention.
704	Results were contrasted for several studies testing exercise (negative) and cognitive training (mixed results) in the management of older patients suffering from neurocognitive disorders.
705	The new direct oral anticoagulants are increasingly prescribed in older patients despite the paucity of data.
706	New information has been released in 2018 from « real-world » data that seem reassuring about their risk/benefit ratio in old-old patients, provided a careful prescription.
707	Finally, the Mediterranean diet is still gaining credit with a new study showing its benefits in preventing frailty in community-dwelling older persons.
708	A 52-year-old woman with newly diagnosed cervical carcinoma was referred an F-FDG PET/CT for staging.
709	The PET/CT images demonstrated the known carcinoma and multiple enlarged lymph nodes with increased FDG activity.
710	In addition, there was a focus of intense FDG activity characteristic of hypermetabolic malignancy in the region of gastric antrum.
711	Finally, this lesion was confirmed as gastric ulcer by biopsy.
712	This patient responded well to antiulcer treatment.
713	Heterozygous mutations in syntaxin-binding protein 1 (STXBP1) gene are associated with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 4 (EIEE4).
714	This condition is characterized by epilepsy, developmental delay (DD), and various movement disorders.
715	Herein, we will report 5 unrelated patients with different de novo mutations in STXBP1.
716	In addition, we conducted an online survey through Facebook to identify the incidence of bruxism (BRX) in these patients.
717	Four out of 5 patients (80%) presented with awake BRX (A-BRX).
718	Bruxism was also reported in 81.4% (57/70) of the patients with STXBP1 encephalopathy through the online questionnaire.
719	No consistent correlation was identified between the type of mutation and development of movement disorders or BRX.
720	This is the first study to demonstrate A-BRX in patients with STXBP1 mutation.
721	Given the role of STXBP1 in exocytosis of neurotransmitters and other manifestations of dopamine dysregulation in patients with STXBP1-EIEE4, we suggest that in patients with STXBP1 encephalopathy, A-BRX might be the result of the involvement of dopaminergic circuits.
722	Following the publication of this article [1], the authors informed us of the following typographical errors in the Results section (the changes are marked in bold).
723	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis is critical in maintaining metabolic regulation.
724	Once it is disrupted due to accumulated unfolded proteins, ER homeostasis is restored via activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR); hence, the UPR affects diverse physiological processes.
725	However, how ER stress influences adipocyte functions is not well known.
726	In this study, we investigated the effect of ER stress in thermogenic capacity of mice beige adipocytes.
727	Here, we show that the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) involved in thermoregulation is severely suppressed under ER stress conditions (afflicted by tunicamycin) in inguinal white adipose tissue (IWAT) both in vitro and in vivo.
728	Further investigation showed that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were both activated after ER stress stimulation and regulated the mRNA levels of Ucp1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (Pparγ), which is known as a Ucp1 transcriptional activator, in vitro and ex vivo.
729	We also found that Pparγ protein was significantly degraded, reducing its recruitment to the Ucp1 enhancer, thereby downregulating Ucp1 expression.
730	Additionally, only JNK inhibition, but not ERK, rescued the Pparγ protein.
731	These findings provide novel insights into the regulatory effect of ER stress on Ucp1 expression via Pparγ suppression in beige adipocytes.
732	It has been demonstrated that microRNA-98 (miR-98) is dysregulated in multiple types of solid tumors, but its expression and impact in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is unclear.
733	To explore the prognostic role of miR-98 in AML, 164 AML patients with the miR-98 expression data were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and enrolled in this study.
734	First, patients were divided into chemotherapy-only (chemotherapy) group and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) group.
735	Each group was then divided in two groups by the median expression level of miR-98.
736	In chemotherapy group, high miR-98 expression was associated with longer event-free survival (EFS, P = 0.003) and overall survival (OS, P = 0.004), but in allo-HSCT group, EFS and OS were not significantly different between high and low miR-98 expressers.
737	Second, All patients were divided in two groups by the median expression level of miR-98.
738	In low miR-98 expressers, those treated with allo-HSCT had longer EFS (P = 0.001) and OS (P < 0.001) than chemotherapy, but in high miR-98 expressers, survival was independent from treatment modalities.
739	Gene ontology enrichment analysis indicated that the genes associated with miR-98 expression were mainly concentrated in "definitive hemopoiesis", "negative regulation of myeloid cell differentiation" and "signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells" pathways.
740	In conclusion, our results indicated that high miR-98 expression confers good prognosis in AML patients treated with chemotherapy alone.
741	Patients with low miR-98 expression may benefit from allo-HSCT.
742	The impact of mechanical disturbance and oxygen induced acidification on the concentration and size fractionation of the 12 metal(loid)s As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Tl, V and the polyatomic nonmetals C, P and S in the pore water was studied.
743	Using the meso profiling and sampling system (messy) 12 pore water depth profiles were sampled from two incubation experiments undertaken in parallel, which were both mechanically disturbed in the lab and subsequently exposed to a different air supply.
744	In parallel to the low invasive, automated sampling process the redox potential, the pH value and the O2 concentration were detected.
745	Simultaneous quantification of all analytes by inductively coupled plasma-triple quad-mass spectrometry in the two different size classes dissolved (<0.45 μm) and colloidal (0.45-16 μm) showed: i) the predominant influence of the pH on the mobility of metals; ii) the mobility of metalloids was strongly impacted by the mechanical disturbance; and iii) the colloidal release is less important except for Fe, P, and Ni.
746	AIM-To identify characteristics of young children with cerebral palsy (CP), and intrinsic and extrinsic factors, that may be associated with parental perceptions regarding family-centred health care services.
747	METHOD-We conducted a cross-sectional study, drawing our sample from the Canadian Cerebral Palsy Registry (CCPR).
748	Parents rated the extent of family-centred care provided by their child's health care teams using the 56-item Measures of Process of Care (MPOC) questionnaire.
749	Environmental and CP phenotypic variables were extracted from the CCPR for group comparisons.
750	Low and high MPOC-56 raters were also compared.
751	RESULTS-Valid responses were obtained from 282 families (90%).
752	All MPOC-56 subscales were highly rated (median ≥6.0), indicating satisfaction with health care services, with the exception of the Providing General Information subscale (median 4.8, interquartile range 3.2-6.0).
753	Parents from Nova Scotia rated all subscales significantly higher than parents from other regions.
754	CP subtype and severity were not significantly associated with MPOC-56 subscale scores.
755	Higher socio-economic status was associated with lower MPOC-56 subscale scores.
756	Higher paternal educational attainment and household income were significantly associated with lower scores on the Providing General Information and Providing Specific Information about the Child subscales respectively.
757	INTERPRETATION-Participants affirmed the provision of family-centred services from Canadian pediatric rehabilitation centres.
758	Sociodemographic factors were associated with parental perceptions of family-centred services.
759	WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS-Sociodemographic factors were associated with parental perceptions of family-centred care.
760	Factors intrinsic to the child's cerebral palsy were not associated with parental perceptions.
761	The P2X7 receptor is an ATP-binding cation channel involved in a broad range of inflammatory diseases.
762	However, little is known about the potential role of P2X7R in alcohol-induced steatohepatitis and intestinal injury.
763	In our study, C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with P2X7R antagonists Brilliant Blue G and A438079 from the 4th day to the 10th day during the induction of chronic plus binge alcohol feeding model.
764	Our results showed that alcohol feeding induced significant steatohepatitis and liver injury, which were mitigated by P2X7R blockade as evidenced by decreased serum levels of ALT, AST, T-CHO and TG, reduced lipid accumulation, and less inflammation.
765	The increased intestinal inflammatory cytokines production and the prominent intestinal barrier disruption caused by alcohol were also modulated by P2X7R antagonism.
766	Interestingly, alcohol feeding increased the relative abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes while decreased the number of phylum Verrucomicrobia and genus Akkermansia in the cecal content, which were reversed by P2X7R antagonist.
767	Importantly, the improvement of intestinal barrier function and the restoration of partial taxonomic alterations in the gut microbiota might contribute to protect the liver from gut microbiota dysbiosis-induced second hit.
768	Furthermore, P2X7R blockade inhibited MEK1/2-ERK1/2 phosphorylation and egr-1 expression in both liver and intestine from alcohol-fed mice.
769	Collectively, P2X7R blockade mitigates alcohol-induced steatohepatitis and intestinal injury by inhibiting MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling and egr-1 expression.
770	These studies strongly suggest that P2X7R blockade may be a promising therapeutic approach for treating alcoholic liver disease.
771	Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) containing a preponderance of basic amino acids are able to deliver biologically active macromolecules and nanomaterials into live cells.
772	Quantum dots (QDs) are nanoparticles with unique fluorescence properties that have found wide application in biomedical imaging.
773	In this study, we demonstrate transduction of an L6 CPP (RRWQWR) derived from bovine lactoferricin (LFcin) into human lung cancer cells.
774	L6 noncovalently interacts with QDs to form stable complexes.
775	L6/QD complexes enter cells most efficiently when prepared at a nitrogen/phosphate ratio of 60.
776	Mechanistic studies indicate that L6/QD complexes enter cells by endocytosis.
777	Treatment with 1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one (BIT), an industrial preservative that enhances uptake of certain CPPs, does not affect L6 CPP-mediated protein transduction efficiency.
778	L6 and L6/QD complexes are not cytotoxic.
779	These results indicate that L6 LFcin might be an efficient and safe nanoshuttle for nanoparticles or nanomedicines in biomedical applications.
780	Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is produced mainly by phytoplankton and bacteria.
781	It is relatively abundant and ubiquitous in the marine environment, where bacterioplankton make use of it readily as both carbon and sulfur sources.
782	In one transformation pathway, part of the molecule becomes dimethylsulfide (DMS), which escapes into the atmosphere and plays an important role in the sulfur exchange between oceans and atmosphere.
783	Through its other dominant catabolic pathway, bacteria are able to use it as sulfur source.
784	During the past few years, a number of genes involved in its transformation have been characterized.
785	Identifying genes in taxonomic groups not amenable to conventional methods of cultivation is challenging.
786	Indeed, functional annotation of genes in environmental studies is not straightforward, considering that particular taxa are not well represented in the available sequence databases.
787	Furthermore, many genes belong to families of paralogs with similar sequences but perhaps different functions.
788	In this study, we develop in silico approaches to infer protein function of an environmentally important gene (dmdA) that carries out the first step in the sulfur assimilation from DMSP.
789	The method combines a set of tools to annotate a targeted gene in genome databases and metagenome assemblies.
790	The method will be useful to identify genes that carry out key biochemical processes in the environment.
791	Vitamin C is an antioxidant and acts as a cofactor for many enzymatic reactions.
792	Humans obtain vitamin C from dietary sources via intestinal absorption, a process that involves the sodium-dependent vitamin C transporters-1 and -2 (SVCT1 and SVCT2).
793	Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infection impacts intestinal absorption/secretory functions, but nothing is known about its effect on ascorbic acid (AA) uptake.
794	Here we demonstrate that infection of Caco-2 cells with ETEC led to a significant inhibition in intestinal AA uptake.
795	This inhibition was associated with a marked reduction in hSVCT1 and hSVCT2 protein, mRNA, and heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) expression levels as well as significant inhibition in the activity of both the SLC23A1 and SLC23A2 promoters.
796	Similarly, exposure of mice to ETEC led to a significant inhibition in intestinal AA uptake and reduction in mSVCT1 and mSVCT2 protein, mRNA, and hnRNA expression levels.
797	Inhibition was caused by the action of heat labile enterotoxin (LT), since infecting Caco-2 cells with LT-deficient ETEC (ΔLT) failed to impact AA uptake.
798	Because LT activates adenylate cyclase, we also examined the effect of dibutyryl-cAMP in AA uptake by Caco-2 cells and observed a significant inhibition.
799	Furthermore, treating the cells with celastrol, a specific NF-κB inhibitor, significantly blocked the inhibition of AA uptake caused by ETEC infection.
800	Together, these data demonstrate that ETEC infection impairs intestinal AA uptake through a cAMP-dependent NF-κB-mediated pathway that regulates both SLC23A1 and SLC23A2 transcription.
801	NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our findings demonstrate that heat-labile enterotoxin produced by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli inhibits AA uptake in intestinal epithelial cells and mouse intestine.
802	This effect is mediated through transcriptional repression of SLC23A1 (SVCT1) and SLC23A2 (SVCT2) via a cAMP-dependent NF-κB signaling pathway.
803	Global temperatures have increased considerably over the last decades, directly impacting the number, intensity and duration of extreme events such as heat waves.
804	Climate model projections accounting for anthropogenic factors indicate that deadly mega-heat waves are likely to become more frequent in the future.
805	Although the atmospheric features and social-economic related impacts of heat waves have already been documented in various regions around the world, for other highly populated regions, such as the Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro (MRRJ), a similar objective assessment is still needed.
806	Heat waves directly impact the public health sector and particularly the less wealthy and elderly population groups.
807	During February 2010, an elevated mortality peak occurred during a 8-day period (from 2 to 9 Feb 2010) characterized as a heat wave episode in MRRJ.
808	A total excess of 737 deaths was recorded with the elderly group registering the highest mortality incidence.
809	During this heat wave period, a quasi-stationary anticyclonic anomaly forced in altitude by a Rossby wave train was established over the south Brazilian coast.
810	At the surface, the meteorological scenario from January 2010 to the heat wave period was marked by clear sky conditions, large precipitation deficits, and enhanced diabatic heating.
811	During the heat wave period, warm and dry air masses were advected from interior regions towards the MRRJ, exacerbating temperature conditions by pronounced subsidence and adiabatic heating mechanisms.
812	All these conditions contributed to pronounced positive temperature anomalies, reinforced by land-atmosphere feedbacks.
813	During last two decades spectacular development of light emitting diodes (LEDs) has been achieved owing to their widespread application possibilities.
814	However, traditional LEDs suffer from unavoidable energy loss due to the down conversion of photons, toxicity due to the involvement of rare-earth materials in their production, higher manufacturing cost, and reduced thermal stability that prevent them from all-inclusive applications.
815	To address the existing challenges associated with current commercially available white LEDs, herein, we report on a broadband emission originating from an intrinsic lanthanide-free single-molecule based LED.
816	Self-assembly of a butterfly-shaped strontium-based compound {[Sr(H2btc)2(MeOH)(H2O)2]•2H2O} (1) was achieved through the reaction of Sr(NO3)2 with a benzene-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid hydrate (1,2,3-H3btc) under hydrothermal conditions.
817	White LED based on this single molecule exhibited a remarkable broadband luminescent spectrum with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates at (0.33, 0.32) under 30 mA current injection.
818	Such a broad luminescent spectrum can be attributed to the simultaneous existence of several emission lines originating from the intramolecular interactions within the structure.
819	To further examine the nature of the observed transitions, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to explore the geometric and electronic properties of the complex.
820	Our study thus paves the way toward a key step for developing a basic understanding and the development of high performance broadband light emitting devices with environment-friendly characteristics based on organic‒inorganic supramolecular materials.
821	The skin secretions of many frogs have genetically-encoded, endogenous antimicrobial peptides (AMPs).
822	Other species, especially aposematic poison frogs, secrete exogenously derived alkaloids that serve as potent defense molecules.
823	The origins of these defense systems are not clear, but a novel bile-acid derived metabolite, tauromantellic acid, was recently discovered and shown to be endogenous in poison frogs (Mantella, Dendrobates, and Epipedobates).
824	These observations raise questions about the evolutionary history of AMP genetic elements, the mechanism and function of tauromatellic acid production, and links between these systems.
825	To understand the diversity and expression of AMPs among frogs, we assembled skin transcriptomes of 13 species across the anuran phylogeny.
826	Our analyses revealed a diversity of AMPs and AMP expression levels across the phylogenetic history of frogs, but no observations of AMPs in Mantella We examined genes expressed in the bile-acid metabolic pathway and found that CYP7A1 (Cytochrome P450), BAAT (bile acid-CoA: amino acid N-acyltransferase), and AMACR (alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase) were highly expressed in the skin of M. betsileo and either lowly expressed or absent in other frog species.
827	In particular, CYP7A1 catalyzes the first reaction in the cholesterol catabolic pathway and is the rate-limiting step in regulation of bile acid synthesis, suggesting unique activation of the bile acid pathway in Mantella skin.
828	The activation of the bile acid pathway in the skin of Mantella and the lack of observed AMPs fuel new questions about the evolution of defense compounds and the ectopic expression of the bile-acid pathway.
829	OBJECTIVE-To conduct a systematic review of studies exploring potential biomarkers for development, course and efficacy of treatment of lymphomas in salivary glands of patients with Sjögren's syndrome.
830	MATERIAL AND METHODS-Eligible studies were identified through a comprehensive search of two databases, i.e.
831	PubMed and EMBASE.
832	Quality of included articles was assessed with the 'Quality In Prognosis Studies' (QUIPS) tool.
833	The 'CHecklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling Studies' (CHARMS) was used to facilitate data extraction.
834	RESULTS-Fifty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria.
835	Only one study assessed the progression of lymphoma.
836	Moderate risk of bias was detected in 'outcome measurement', 'study participation' and 'study confounding' domains.
837	Parotid gland enlargement, mixed monoclonal cryoglobulins and low C4 levels represented strongest predictors of lymphoma development.
838	The role of histological biomarkers, and specifically germinal centers, remains controversial.
839	Clinical and methodological heterogeneity across studies precluded conduct of a meta-analysis.
840	CONCLUSIONS-Specific biomarkers in combination with clinical manifestations represent potential candidates for advancing precision medicine approaches to lymphoma prediction in patients with Sjögren's syndrome.
841	Current focus has increasingly been on genetic and epigenetic markers as candidate predictors.
842	Predictive accuracy of key biomarker candidates remains to be tested in well-designed prospectively-followed Sjögren's syndrome cohorts.

845	Perceptual judgements concerning the magnitude of a stimulus feature are typically influenced more by the left side of the stimulus than by the right side.
846	This research examined whether the leftward bias also applies to judgements of the attractiveness of abstract visual patterns.
847	Across four experiments participants chose between two versions of a stimulus which either had an attractive left side or an attractive right side.
848	Experiments 1 and 2 presented artworks and experiments 3 and 4 presented wallpaper designs.
849	In each experiment participants showed a significant bias to choose the stimulus with an attractive left side more than the stimulus with an attractive right side.
850	The leftward bias emerged at age 10/11, was not caused by a systematic asymmetry in the perception of colourfulness or complexity, and was stronger when the difference in attractiveness between the left and right sides was larger.
851	The results are relevant to the aesthetics of product and packaging design and show that leftward biases extend to the perceptual judgement of everyday items.
852	Possible causes of the leftward bias for attractiveness judgements are discussed and it is suggested that the size of the bias may not be a measure of the degree of hemispheric specialization.
853	Treewidth is a parameter that measures how tree-like a relational instance is, and whether it can reasonably be decomposed into a tree.
854	Many computation tasks are known to be tractable on databases of small treewidth, but computing the treewidth of a given instance is intractable.
855	This article is the first large-scale experimental study of treewidth and tree decompositions of real-world database instances (25 datasets from 8 different domains, with sizes ranging from a few thousand to a few million vertices).
856	The goal is to determine which data, if any, can benefit of the wealth of algorithms for databases of small treewidth.
857	For each dataset, we obtain upper and lower bound estimations of their treewidth, and study the properties of their tree decompositions.
858	We show in particular that, even when treewidth is high, using partial tree decompositions can result in data structures that can assist algorithms.
859	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death in Asia.
860	HCC is less sensitive to chemotherapy and is known to express multidrug resistant genes to acquire resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, therefore the development of a potent HCC suppressor is essential in treating HCC.
861	Our previous reports demonstrated that oligo-fucoidan from the brown seaweed Sargassum hemiphyllum elevates microRNA-29b to inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition in hepatoma cells.
862	In this study, we aimed to examine in vitro effect of oligo-fucoidan in hepatocellular carcinoma through apoptosis and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) pathway.
863	Oligo-fucoidan was studied for its anti-hepatoma cells by MTT and DNA ladder analysis.
864	And the mechanism was studied by flow cytometry, qPCR and western blot analysis.
865	In this study, oligo-fucoidan induced sub-G1 phase cell cycle arrest and activation of caspases, indicating that the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways were involved in the mechanism of oligo-fucoidan-induced cell death.
866	Moreover, oligo-fucoidan significantly increased the expression of p53, p21, and p27, while cyclin-B1 and -D1 were decreased at the mRNA and protein levels.
867	Finally, we showed that targeting apoptosis and cell cycle pathways could also contribute to the induction of the lncRNA-Saf and lncRNA-p21.
868	Through human lncRNA profiler array analysis, the differential expression of lncRNAs in HCC cells following oligo-fucoidan exposure was further examined.
869	These findings indicated that lncRNAs switched oligo-fucoidan-induced apoptosis, which might be potentially valuable in HCC adjuvant therapy.
870	Background-It has been well known that the degeneration of hip articular cartilage with osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) increases the instability of hip and accelerates the development process of ONFH.
871	A better understanding of the expression of chondrogenesis-related and arthritis-related genes of cartilage along with the progression of ONFH seems to be essential for further insight into the molecular mechanisms of ONFH pathogenesis.
872	Methods-We analyzed the differentially expressed gene profile (GSE74089) of human hip articular cartilage with ONFH.
873	The functions and pathway enrichments of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed via GO and KEGG analysis.
874	The expression of six selected critical chondrogenesis-related and four arthritis-related genes in eight human hip articular cartilage with femoral neck fracture (FNF) and 26 human hip articular cartilage with different stages ONFH (6 cases of Ficat stage II, 10 cases of Ficat stage III and 10 cases of Ficat stage IV) were detected.
875	Results-A total of 2,174 DEGs, including 1,482 up-regulated and 692 down-regulated ones, were obtained in the ONFH cartilage specimens compared to the control group.
876	The GO and KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the function of these DEGs mainly enriched in extracellular matrix, angiogenesis, antigen processing and presentation.
877	The results showed a significant stepwise up-expression of chondrogenesis-related genes, including MMP13, ASPN, COL1A1, OGN, COL2A1 and BMP2, along with the progression of ONFH.
878	The arthritis-related genes IL1β, IL6 and TNFα were only found up-expressed in Ficat IV stage which indicated that the arthritis-related molecular changes were not significant in the progression of ONFH before Ficat III stage.
879	However, the arthritis-related gene PTGS2 was significant stepwise up-expression along with the progression of ONFH which makes it to be a sensitive arthritis-related biomarker of ONFH.
880	Conclusion-Expression changes of six chondrogenesis-related and four arthritis-related genes were found in hip articular cartilage specimens with different ONFH Ficat stages.
881	These findings are expected to a get a further insight into the molecular mechanisms of ONFH progression.
882	In this report, we provide the first evidence that mood and anxiety dimensions are associated with unique aspects of EEG responses to reward and punishment, respectively.
883	We reanalyzed data from our prior publication of a categorical depiction of depression to address more sophisticated dimensional hypotheses.
884	Highly symptomatic depressed individuals (N = 46) completed a probabilistic learning task with concurrent EEG.
885	Measures of anxiety and depression symptomatology were significantly correlated with each other; however, only anxiety predicted better avoidance learning due to a tighter coupling of negative prediction error signaling with punishment-specific EEG features.
886	In contrast, depression predicted a smaller reward-related EEG feature, but this did not affect prediction error coupling or the ability to learn from reward.
887	We suggest that this reward-related alteration reflects motivational or hedonic aspects of reward and not a diminishment in the ability to represent the information content of reinforcements.
888	These findings compel further research into the domain-specific neural systems underlying dimensional aspects of psychiatric disease.
889	Objectives-To determine clinical utility of Onclarity human papillomavirus (HPV) assay for atypical squamous cells-undetermined significance (ASC-US) triage, and the value of HPV genotyping within ASC-US.
890	Methods-Women (n = 33,858; 21 years or older) had HPV testing using Onclarity and Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2).
891	ASC-US individuals (n = 1,960, 5.8%) were referred to colposcopy.
892	Results-Of ASC-US, 39.1% were HPV positive by Onclarity; HPV 16 was the most prevalent genotype (7.4%).
893	Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN 2) and CIN 3+ prevalences were 4.4% and 2.2%, respectively.
894	Onclarity had sensitivity for CIN 2+ (85.7%) and CIN 3+ (91.4%), and specificities for CIN 2+ (64.1%) and CIN 3+ (62.0%), similar to HC2.
895	Risks for CIN 3+ were 16.1%, 2.8%, 2.5%, and 2.7% with HPV 16, 18, 45, and 11 other genotypes, respectively.
896	Conclusions-Onclarity is clinically validated for ASC-US triage.
897	Through risk stratification, genotyping could help identify women at highest risk for CIN 3+.
898	In 2017, the curriculum areas of Digital Technologies and Hangarau Matihiko were added to the New Zealand school curricula covering content related to the fundamental principles of computer science and developing digital technologies.
899	This poses the challenge of up-skilling teachers nationwide to understand the concepts in the curricula so teachers and schools can develop their own unique implementations of the curriculum.
900	In this paper we outline the resources and support being made available to teachers and discuss how this relates to the broader ideas behind the curriculum.
901	BACKGROUND-Few long-term studies define the appropriate extent of surgery and recurrence rates for unilateral multinodular goiter.
902	We compared the rate and time to reoperation in patients with multinodular goiter who underwent lobectomy to that of patients with benign solitary nodule.
903	METHODS-Retrospective study of a prospective database of all patients who underwent lobectomy for multinodular goiter or solitary nodule from 1991 to 2017.
904	We analyzed reoperation rates and time to reoperation.
905	Reoperation was defined as the need for completion thyroidectomy determined the following citeria: nodule greater than 3 cm, multiple nodules, nodule growth or suspicion for malignancy by ultrasound or fine-needle aspiration biopsy, or compressive symptoms.
906	RESULTS-Included in the study were 2,675 lobectomies; 852 (31.85%) for multinodular goiter.
907	In total, 394 patients (14.7%) underwent reoperation: 261 (30.6%) with a previous multinodular goiter and 133 (7.29%) with solitary nodule (P < .0001).
908	A total of 80% of the patients with multinodular goiter and 67.66% with solitary nodule recurred as multinodular goiter; 3.5% of all recurrences were carcinomas.
909	The mean time to reoperation was 14.8 years, without difference between groups (P = .5765).
910	Patients without reoperation were younger (47 ± 15 vs 54 ± 13 years of age, P < .0001) and more likely to be male (P < .0001).
911	CONCLUSION-Lobectomy for unilateral multinodular goiter is the procedure of choice given the length of time to reoperation.
912	Patients and surgeons should be aware of the need for long-term surveillance.
913	OBJECTIVES-To compare the effect of toric versus spherical soft contact lenses on objective measures of visual performance using visual acuity and electromyography of the orbicularis oculi muscle.
914	METHODS-Current soft contact lens wearers with -0.75 to -1.75 D astigmatism in each eye were binocularly fitted with toric (1-Day ACUVUE MOIST for astigmatism) and spherical (1-Day ACUVUE MOIST) contact lenses in random order.
915	After each fitting and at 1-week follow-up, high- and low-contrast visual acuities were measured.
916	Electromyography was used to objectively evaluate eyestrain.
917	Linear mixed models were used to assess differences between toric and spherical contact lenses.
918	RESULTS-The mean age (±SD) of the 60 participants was 27.5±5.0 years, spherical refractive error was -3.68±2.01 D, and cylinder was -1.28±0.36 D. High- and low-contrast visual acuities with toric lenses were better than with spherical lenses at both fitting (toric high-contrast: -0.065±0.078 and low-contrast: 0.133±0.103 vs. spherical high-contrast: 0.001±0.104 and low-contrast: 0.224±0.107) and follow-up (toric high-contrast: -0.083±0.087 and low-contrast: 0.108±0.107 vs. spherical high-contrast: -0.015±0.095 and low-contrast: 0.211±0.104) (all P<0.0001).
919	Electromyography-measured eyestrain was less with toric versus spherical contact lenses at fitting (least-square ratio of toric over spherical=0.72; P=0.0019) but not at follow-up (ratio=0.86; P=0.11).
920	CONCLUSION-These results suggest that toric contact lenses provided improved objective measures of vision in a low-to-moderate astigmatic population.
921	The objective of this study was to evaluate intraoperative hypothermia as a predictor of complication and prognosis in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer treated with radical cystectomy.The data of 124 patients treated with radical cystectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer in our department, from 2003 to 2016, were retrospectively collected.
922	The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the lowest intraoperative deep body temperature, that is, the hypothermia group (<96.8°F) and the normothermia group (≥96.8°F).
923	Preoperative and intraoperative variables were compared among the 2 groups, and factors associated with complications, recurrences, and survivals were analyzed.Sixty-eight (54.8%) of the 124 patients presented intraoperative hypothermia.
924	There was no significant difference in the patient's characteristics between the 2 groups.
925	Postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo ≤III) of any types occurred in 15 patients (22.1%) in the hypothermia group, as compared with 8 patients (14.3%) in the normothermia group (P = .27).
926	The hypothermia group had a higher pathologic stage (P = .029) and a higher recurrence rate within 12 months (P = .013), as compared with the normothermia group.
927	Intraoperative hypothermia was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in all patients (hazard ratio [HR] 2.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-2.85; P = .047).
928	When stratified by disease stage, stage II intraoperative hypothermia was an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival (HR 3.35; 95% CI, 1.27-8.83; P = .015) and overall survival (HR 4.24; 95% CI, 1.38-12.9; P = .011).This study suggests that intraoperative hypothermia could be a significant predictor for recurrence and survival in muscle-invasive bladder cancer treated with radical cystectomy.
929	Patients with craniopharyngioma experience excess morbidity and mortality when compared with the background population and with other hypopituitary patients.
930	Large, suprasellar tumours which form micropapillae into surrounding structures can cause hypothalamic damage before any therapeutic intervention; attempted gross total resection can lead to hypothalamic obesity, sleep disorders, thirst disorders and dysregulation of temperature as well as panhypopituitarism.
931	The management of tumour bulk and the pathophysiology of hypothalamic complications have been reviewed extensively.
932	We present a practical, clinical approach to management of hypothalamic disease in a patient with craniopharyngioma and highlight potential targets for future pharmacological or surgical intervention.

935	The switch Markov chain has been extensively studied as the most natural Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach for sampling graphs with prescribed degree sequences.
936	We use comparison arguments with other—less natural but simpler to analyze—Markov chains, to show that the switch chain mixes rapidly in two different settings.
937	We first study the classic problem of uniformly sampling simple undirected, as well as bipartite, graphs with a given degree sequence.
938	We apply an embedding argument, involving a Markov chain defined by Jerrum and Sinclair (TCS, 1990) for sampling graphs that almost have a given degree sequence, to show rapid mixing for degree sequences satisfying strong stability, a notion closely related to P-stability.
939	This results in a much shorter proof that unifies the currently known rapid mixing results of the switch chain and extends them up to sharp characterizations of P-stability.
940	In particular, our work resolves an open problem posed by Greenhill (SODA, 2015).
941	Secondly, in order to illustrate the power of our approach, we study the problem of uniformly sampling graphs for which—in addition to the degree sequence—a joint degree distribution is given.
942	Although the problem was formalized over a decade ago, and despite its practical significance in generating synthetic network topologies, small progress has been made on the random sampling of such graphs.
943	The case of a single degree class reduces to sampling of regular graphs, but beyond this almost nothing is known.
944	We fully resolve the case of two degree classes, by showing that the switch Markov chain is always rapidly mixing.
945	Again, we first analyze an auxiliary chain for strongly stable instances on an augmented state space and then use an embedding argument.

947	Fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) with the use of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) leads to more extensive resection of high-grade glioma (HGG) and longer overall survival (OS) of patients compared to conventional resection.
948	The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of 5-ALA dosages on residual tumor volume (RTV) and OS in patients with glioblastoma.
949	A retrospective cohort study for patients who participated in a phase I and II dose-escalation clinical trial on 5-ALA for resection of HGG.
950	A total of 25 patients were found to have newly diagnosed glioblastoma on histology and enrolled in our study.
951	Patients receiving low doses of 5-ALA (10–30 mg/kg) (n = 6) were compared to those receiving high doses (40–50 mg/kg) (n = 19).
952	Pre- and post-operative contrast enhanced T1W MRI were evaluated with volumetric analysis.
953	Median RTV was 0.69 cm3 and 0.00 cm3 in the low and high dose groups respectively (p = 0.975).
954	A gross total resection (GTR) was more likely in the high dose group, though this was not statistically significant.
955	No significant difference was found in median OS between the high and low dose groups (p = 0.6787).
956	High doses of 5-ALA FGS are associated with less RTV and greater probability of GTR.
957	5-ALA dose was not associated with OS.
958	Further studies with a larger patient cohort are warranted.
959	Rationale-Improved birth weight outcomes have been reported for infants of mothers imprisoned during pregnancy relative to similarly disadvantaged mothers, however, findings are equivocal and evidence is lacking from jurisdictions outside the United States.
960	Objective-To investigate whether maternal imprisonment during pregnancy is a determinant of low birth weight (<2500 g) for Indigenous and non-Indigenous infants in Western Australia.
961	Methods-A longitudinal sample of 41,910 singleton infants born in Western Australia (October 1985-December 2013), was identified with linked administrative data and examined by five mutually exclusive categories of maternal corrections history; (i) imprisonment in pregnancy, (ii) imprisonment before pregnancy, (iii) first imprisonment after birth, (iv) community-based corrections record without imprisonment at any time, and (v) no corrections record at any time.
962	Univariate and multivariate Poisson regression was performed to determine key risk factors for low birth weight.
963	Prevalence of risk factors were calculated by maternal corrections history.
964	Results-After adjusting for other significant pregnancy risks, maternal imprisonment before (Indigenous RR 2.02, 95%CI 1.84-2.22, p<.001; non-Indigenous RR 2.48, 95%CI 1.98-3.12, p<.001) or during (Indigenous RR 1.96, 95%CI 1.68-2.29, p<.001; non-Indigenous RR 2.12, 95%CI 1.48-3.03, p<.001) pregnancy remained strong determinants of low birth weight, and carried greater risk than imprisonment after birth (Indigenous RR 1.58, 95%CI 1.44-1.74, p<.001; non-Indigenous RR 1.75, 95%CI 1.51-2.04, p<.001) or community-based corrections orders (Indigenous RR 1.32, 95%CI 1.21-1.43, p<.001; non-Indigenous RR 1.40, 95%CI 1.05-1.88, p<.001), relative to no corrections record.
965	Pregnancy risk factors more prevalent amongst infants whose mothers were imprisoned before or during pregnancy included substance-use related service contacts, hospitalisation for injury, mental health service contacts, and having a sibling in contact with the child protection system.
966	Conclusion-Western Australian infants with mothers imprisoned before or during pregnancy experience elevated risk of low birth weight and exposure to maternal substance use, injury and mental distress in pregnancy.
967	First described in 1998, apelin is one of the endogenous ligands of the apelinergic receptor.
968	Since its discovery, its possible role in human physiology and disease has been intensively studied.
969	Apelin is a native cardioprotective agent that the body synthesizes to create atheroprotective, antihypertensive, and regenerative effects in the body.
970	By antagonizing the RAA system, apelin could play an important role in heart failure and hypertension.
971	It is also involved in myocardial protection against ischemia/reperfusion injury, post-ischemic remodeling, and myocardial fibrosis.
972	A small number of studies even suggest that serum apelin levels may be involved the development of life-threatening arrhythmias.
973	All this information generated excitement about potential therapeutic effects in patients with heart failure and myocardial infarction.
974	The therapeutic index of apelin is unknown but is anticipated to be favorable based on the small number of studies.
975	In this review, we summarize the mechanisms by which apelin exerts its cardioprotective effects and its connection with the cardiorenal axis.
976	Also, we report the potential therapeutic applications of synthetic and native regulated apelin.
977	If larger studies can be performed, it is possible that apelin-mediated drug treatment may play a major role for a large number of patients worldwide in the future.
978	Intraosseous myoepithelial tumors are very rare.
979	Due to the low incidence and diverse histologic features, accurate diagnosis is challenging, necessitating ancillary immunohistochemistry.
980	Moreover, genetic abnormality in this tumor was not revealed until recently.
981	Although EWSR1 translocation is involved in half of the cases of intraosseous myoepithelioma, only a few cases have indicated its counterpart gene.
982	We herein describe a case of intraosseous myoepithelioma with a novel localization in the fourth metatarsal bone of a 36-year-old female.
983	Cytogenetic analysis using next generation sequencing detected a rare EWSR1-PBX3 fusion.
984	Next generation sequencing could be useful in understanding the cytogenetic characteristics of intraosseous myoepithelioma, and in obtaining an accurate diagnosis of this rare condition.
985	This paper studies optimal control subject to changing conditions.
986	This is an area that recently received a lot of attention as it arises in numerous situations in practice.
987	Some applications being cloud computing systems with fluctuating arrival rates, or the time-varying capacity as encountered in power-aware systems or wireless downlink channels.
988	To study this, we focus on a restless bandit model, which has proved to be a powerful stochastic optimization framework to model scheduling of activities.
989	This paper is a first step to its optimal control when restless bandits are subject to changing conditions.
990	We consider the restless bandit problem in an asymptotic regime, which is obtained by letting the population of bandits grow large, and letting the environment change relatively fast.We present sufficient conditions for a policy to be asymptotically optimal and show that a set of priority policies satisfies these.
991	Under an indexability assumption, an averaged version of Whittle's index policy is proved to be inside this set of asymptotic optimal policies.
992	The performance of the averaged Whittle's index policy is numerically evaluated for a multi-class scheduling problem.
993	OBJECTIVE-Benzodiazepines and anticholinergics are risk factors for delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU).
994	We tested the impact of a deprescribing intervention on short-term delirium outcomes.
995	DESIGN-Multisite randomized clinical trial.
996	SETTING-ICUs of three large hospitals.
997	PARTICIPANTS-Two hundred adults aged 18 years or older and admitted to an ICU with delirium, according to the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale and the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU).
998	Participants had a contraindication to haloperidol (seizure disorder or prolonged QT interval) or preference against haloperidol as a treatment for delirium, and were excluded for serious mental illness, stroke, pregnancy, or alcohol withdrawal.
999	Participants were randomized to a deprescribing intervention or usual care.
1000	The intervention included electronic alerts combined with pharmacist support to deprescribe anticholinergics and benzodiazepines.
1001	MEASUREMENTS-Primary outcomes were delirium duration measured by the CAM-ICU and severity measured by the Delirium Rating Scale Revised-98 (DRS-R-98) and the CAM-ICU-7; secondary outcomes included adverse events and mortality.
1002	RESULTS-Participants had a mean age of 61.8 (SD = 14.3) years, 59% were female, and 52% were African American, with no significant differences in baseline characteristics between groups.
1003	No differences between groups were identified in the number exposed to anticholinergics (P = .219) or benzodiazepines (P = .566), the median total anticholinergic score (P = .282), or the median total benzodiazepine dose in lorazepam equivalents (P = .501).
1004	Neither median delirium/coma-free days (P = .361) nor median change in delirium severity scores (P = .582 for DRS-R-98; P = .333 for CAM-ICU-7) were different between groups.
1005	No differences in adverse events or mortality were identified.
1006	CONCLUSIONS-When added to state-of-the-art clinical services, this deprescribing intervention had no impact on medication use in ICU participants.
1007	Given the age of the population, results of clinical outcomes may not be easily extrapolated to older adults.
1008	Nonetheless, improved approaches for deprescribing or preventing anticholinergics and benzodiazepines should be developed to determine the impact on delirium outcomes.
1009	Lead-free zero-dimensional (0D) organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites have recently attracted increasing attention for its excellent photoluminescence properties and chemical stability.
1010	Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of an air-stable 0D mixed metal halide perovskite (C8NH12)4Bi0.57Sb0.43Br7.H2O, in which individual [BiBr6]3- and [SbBr6]3-octahedral units are completely isolated and surrounded by the large organic cation C8H12N+.
1011	Upon photoexcitation, the bulk crystals exhibit ultrabroad band emission ranging from 400 to 850 nm, which originates from both free excitons and self-trapped excitons.
1012	This is the first example of 0D perovskites with broadband emission spanning the entire visible spectrum.
1013	In addition, (C8NH12)4Bi0.57Sb0.43Br7.H2O exhibits excellent humidity and light stability.
1014	These findings present a new direction towards the design of environmentally-friendly, high-performance 0D perovskite light emitters.
1015	As animals and humans age, the motor system undergoes a progressive functional decline, leading to frailty.
1016	Age-dependent functional deteriorations at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) contribute to this motor aging.
1017	However, it is unclear whether one can intervene in this process to slow motor aging.
1018	The Caenorhabditis elegans BK channel SLO-1 dampens synaptic transmission at NMJs by repressing synaptic release from motor neurons.
1019	Here, we show that genetic ablation of SLO-1 not only reduces the rate of age-dependent motor activity decline to slow motor aging but also surprisingly extends life span.
1020	SLO-1 acts in motor neurons to mediate both functions.
1021	Genetic knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of SLO-1 in aged, but not young, worms can slow motor aging and prolong longevity.
1022	Our results demonstrate that genetic and pharmacological interventions in the aging motor nervous system can promote both health span and life span.
1023	Redox changes and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are part of normal cell metabolism.
1024	While low ROS levels are implicated in cellular signaling pathways necessary for survival, higher levels play major roles in cancer development as well as cell death signaling and execution.
1025	A role for redox changes in apoptosis has been long established; however, several new modalities of regulated cell death have been brought to light, for which the importance of ROS production as well as ROS source and targets are being actively investigated.
1026	In this review, we summarize recent findings on the role of ROS and redox changes in the activation and execution of two major forms of regulated cell death, necroptosis and ferroptosis.
1027	We also discuss the potential of using modulators of these two forms of cell death to exacerbate ROS as a promising anticancer therapy.
1028	OBJECTIVE-To determine if individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) demonstrate different talar cartilage T1ρ relaxation times compared to uninjured controls.
1029	DESIGN-Fifteen CAI (21.13±1.81 years, 4.00±2.07 previous ankle sprains) and fifteen controls (21.07±2.55 years, no previous ankle sprains) participated.
1030	CAI inclusion criteria was in accordance with the International Ankle Consortium guidelines.
1031	Greater T1ρ relaxation times were interpreted as greater degenerative changes.
1032	Participants were non-weight bearing for 30-minutes prior to scanning to unload the cartilage.
1033	Voxel by voxel T1ρ relaxation times were calculated from a five image sequence.
1034	Segmentation of the talar cartilage was performed manually using ITK-SNAP software.
1035	T1ρ relaxation time means and variability across the entire talus and in the anteromeidal, anterolateral, posteromedial, and posterolateral regions of interest were compared between groups using mean differences and effect sizes (ES) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
1036	RESULTS-Individuals with CAI demonstrated higher T1ρ relaxation times (mean ± standard deviation) across the entire talus (CAI: 65.97±10.45ms, Control: 58.84±7.68ms; ES=0.76, 95%CI=0.02-1.50), in the anterolateral (ES=1.00, 95%CI=0.24-1.48), posteromedial (ES=0.74, 95%CI=0.01-1.49), and posterolateral region of interest (ES=3.84, 95%CI=2.63-5.04).
1037	The T1ρ relaxation time variability (mean ± standard deviation) also differed across the overall talus (CAI: 32.78±4.06ms, Control: 28.23±4.45ms; ES=1.04, 95%CI=0.28-1.80), in the anteriolateral, (ES=1.07, 95%CI=0.31, 1.84) and posteriolateral (ES=1.00, 95%CI=0.24-1.75) regions of interest.
1038	CONCLUSIONS-Individuals with CAI demonstrate greater T1ρ relaxation times and higher T1ρ variability compared to uninjured controls.
1039	This finding supports the existing literature illustrating early degenerative joint tissue changes consistent with early onset posttraumatic osteoarthritis in individuals with CAI.
1040	Black lipid membranes (BLMs) provide a biomimetic model system for studying cellular membrane processes, and are important tools in drug screening and biosensing applications.
1041	BLMs offer advantages over liposomes and solid-supported lipid bilayers in applications where access to both leaflets of the bilayer is critical.
1042	Reliable and repeatable formation of BLMs presents a major challenge, especially in systems that require interrogation of the membrane via optical microscopy.
1043	BLMs for optical interrogation are often formed by the manual painting method, which is tedious and has a high failure rate because it involves manual manipulation of nanoscale liquid films for membrane self-assembly.
1044	Here, we describe a fully automated technique for the formation of BLMs within the imaging plane of an inverted fluorescence microscope.
1045	The technique utilizes hydrostatic pressure manipulations within a simple microfluidic device, which are feedback controlled via confocal fluorescence monitoring of the BLM formation process.
1046	An algorithm for monitoring and precision control of BLM formation is devised and optimized to yield an 80% success rate for the formation of BLMs, with formation times on the order of 78 min.
1047	Membranes formed via the automated procedure are confirmed to be fluid and biomimetic via spontaneous insertion of α-hemolysin pores with characteristic conductance of ca.

1049	Graphical Abstract ᅟ.
1050	In this study, chitin nanofiber dispersions prepared in neutral and acidic pH conditions were lyophilized to produce aerogels.
1051	The effects of the freezing speed of the nanofiber dispersions and the dispersibility of the chitin nanofiber were studied.
1052	The characteristics of the aerogels were studied using scanning electron microscopy, relative surface area measurements, and compression tests.
1053	The repulsion forces of the chitin nanofiber in acidic conditions were effective in the formation of a more uniform microstructure during water solidification, resulting in aerogels with a high mechanical strength.
1054	The aerogel made from the chitin nanofiber dispersion prepared in neutral conditions was influenced by ice crystal growth during freezing, resulting in a nonuniform structure.
1055	In contrast, the surface area of the aerogel in neutral conditions interestingly remained unchanged compared to that of the original powder, which was due to the morphological transformation.
1056	To better understand the molecular mechanism of color formation in different varieties of the mulberry fruit, we investigated the functional genes related to anthocyanin and betulinic acid biosynthesis using high-throughput transcriptome sequencing and detected the primary and secondary metabolites in the white (Morus alba L. cv.
1057	'Turkey') and red (Morus alba L. cv.
1058	'Cheongil') mulberry cultivars.
1059	We obtained 171,702,058 high-quality reads with an average read length of 125 bp.
1060	These reads were assembled into 51,272 and 51,159 unigenes in Turkey and Cheongil, respectively.
1061	We also identified the genes related to anthocyanin and triterpene biosynthesis and investigated their expression and metabolite profiles.
1062	Overall, our transcriptome sequencing provides valuable information that could be used in gene discovery, marker-assisted selection, and investigation of metabolic pathways in mulberry.
1063	Additionally, gene expression and metabolite profiles provide new insights into the underlying mechanism of anthocyanin and betulinic acid biosynthesis and relationship between primary and secondary metabolites.
1064	Chaetognaths (arrow worms) are an enigmatic group of marine animals whose phylogenetic position remains elusive, in part because they display a mix of developmental and morphological characters associated with other groups [1, 2].
1065	In particular, it remains unclear whether they are a sister group to protostomes [1, 2], one of the principal animal superclades, or whether they bear a closer relationship with some spiralian phyla [3, 4].
1066	Addressing the phylogenetic position of chaetognaths and refining our understanding of relationships among spiralians are essential to fully comprehend character changes during bilaterian evolution [5].
1067	To tackle these questions, we generated new transcriptomes for ten chaetognath species, compiling an extensive phylogenomic dataset that maximizes data occupancy and taxonomic representation.
1068	We employed inference methods that consider rate and compositional heterogeneity across taxa to avoid limitations of earlier analyses [6].
1069	In this way, we greatly improved the resolution of the protostome tree of life.
1070	We find that chaetognaths cluster together with rotifers, gnathostomulids, and micrognathozoans within an expanded Gnathifera clade and that this clade is the sister group to other spiralians [7, 8].
1071	Our analysis shows that several previously proposed groupings are likely due to systematic error, and we propose a revised organization of Lophotrochozoa with three main clades: Tetraneuralia (mollusks and entoprocts), Lophophorata (brachiopods, phoronids, and ectoprocts), and a third unnamed clade gathering annelids, nemerteans, and platyhelminthes.
1072	Consideration of classical morphological, developmental, and genomic characters in light of this topology indicates secondary loss as a fundamental trend in spiralian evolution.
1073	The involvement of several microRNAs (miRs) in the initiation and development of tumor through the suppression of the target gene expression has been highlighted.
1074	The aberrant expression of microRNA-181d-5p (miR-181d-5p) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 3 (CDKN3) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was then screened by microarray analysis, In the present study, we performed a series of in vivo and in vitro experiments for the purpose of investigating their role in NSCLC and the underlying mechanism.
1075	There was a high expression of CDKN3 while miR-181d-5p was down-regulated in NSCLC.
1076	RT-qPCR, Western blot analysis, and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay further identified that CDKN3 could be negatively regulated by miR-181d-5p.
1077	Moreover, the up-regulation of miR-181d-5p or silencing of CDKN3 could inactivate the Akt signaling pathway.
1078	A549 with lowest miR-181d-5p and H1975 with highest CDKN3 among the five NSCLC cell lines (H1299, A549, H1975, NCI-H157, and GLC-82) were adopted for in vitro experiments, in which expression of miR-181d-5p and CDKN3 was altered by transfection of miR-181d-5p mimic/inhibitor or siRNA targeting CDKN3.
1079	Afterwards, cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, migration, and angiogenesis, as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were evaluated and tumorigenicity was assessed.
1080	In addition, an elevation in miR-181d-5p or depletion in CDKN3 led to significant reductions in proliferation, invasion, migration, angiogenesis, EMT, as well as tumorigenicity of NSCLC cells, coupling with increased cell apoptosis.
1081	In conclusion, this study highlights the tumor suppressive effects of miR-181d-5p on NSCLC via Akt signaling pathway inactivation by suppressing CDKN3, providing a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of NSCLC.
1082	This work studied thermal characteristics and product formation mechanism during pyrolysis of penicillin fermentation residue (PR).
1083	Results showed that PR pyrolysis proceeded in four stages.
1084	The kinetic triplet of each stage was calculated using Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose, and integral master-plot methods.
1085	The kinetic model for stage 1 was the three-dimensional diffusion model, the simple reaction order model for stage 2 and stage 4, and the nucleation-growth model for stage 3.
1086	FTIR analysis suggested that the intensities of absorption peaks of NH, CO, CH, CN, and CO in chars weakened gradually with increasing temperature, corresponding to the production of CH4, CO, NH3, and HCN.
1087	GC-MS results indicated that the high protein content in PR resulted in a high fraction of nitrogenated compounds (amides and amines, nitriles, and N-heterocyclic species) in bio-oil.
1088	The formation mechanism of these compounds was discussed.
1089	Besides, bio-oil also contained large quantities of oxygenated compounds and a few hydrocarbons.
1090	In this paper, we investigate the problem of regulating a continuous-time linear time-invariant (LTI) system to a desired point using discrete event measurements from signal change detection sensors with a logarithmic event generation threshold (trigger), which includes the recently developed neuromorphic vision sensors.
1091	Existing control algorithms typically only process periodic measurements, and thus, a new class of algorithms needs to be developed that can efficiently process the sensors’ asynchronous discrete events for control tasks.
1092	Thus, we present a novel control design procedure that regulates the hybrid system, consisting of the continuous LTI system and a discrete-event signal change observation model, to a desired set point.
1093	Moreover, we provide the set of thresholds (sufficient conditions) for the given system to fulfill the regulation task.
1094	The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated on an unstable system.
1095	Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is a useful data acquisition technique, which is widely used in a variety of practical applications.
1096	The classification of LiDAR-derived rasterized digital surface model (LiDAR-DSM) is a fundamental technique in LiDAR data processing.
1097	In recent years, deep learning methods, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown their capability in remote sensing areas, including LiDAR data processing.
1098	Traditional deep models empirically use a fixed neighborhood system as input to the network.
1099	Therefore, the weight and height of the input rectangle may not be optimal.
1100	In order to modify such handcrafted setting, a spatial transformation network is used here to identify optimal inputs.
1101	The transformed inputs are fed into a well-designed CNN to obtain the final classification results.
1102	Furthermore, morphological profiles are combined with spatial transformation CNN to further improve the classification accuracy.
1103	The proposed frameworks are tested on two LiDAR-DSMs (i.e., the Recology and Houston data sets).
1104	The experimental results show that the proposed models provide competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art methods.
1105	Furthermore, the proposed optimal input identification approach can also be found beneficial for other remote sensing applications.
1106	Bayesian networks in their Factor Graph Reduced Normal Form (FGrn) are a powerful paradigm for implementing inference graphs.
1107	Unfortunately, the computational and memory costs of these networks may be considerable, even for relatively small networks, and this is one of the main reasons why these structures have often been underused in practice.
1108	In this work, through a detailed algorithmic and structural analysis, various solutions for cost reduction are proposed.
1109	An online version of the classic batch learning algorithm is also analyzed, showing very similar results (in an unsupervised context); which is essential even if multilevel structures are to be built.
1110	The solutions proposed, together with the possible online learning algorithm, are included in a C++ library that is quite efficient, especially if compared to the direct use of the well-known sum-product and Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithms.
1111	The results are discussed with particular reference to a Latent Variable Model (LVM) structure.
1112	Without using chiral sources, the Strecker reaction of achiral hydrogen cyanide, p-tolualdehyde and benzhydrylamine gave enantioenriched l- or d-N-benzhydryl-α-(p-tolyl)glycine nitriles with up to >99% ee in a mixed solvent of water and methanol.
1113	Therefore, total spontaneous resolution of α-aminonitriles could occur through a prebiotic mechanism of α-amino acid synthesis.
1114	Moreover, it was demonstrated that the repetition of partial dissolution and crystallization of a suspended conglomerate of aminonitrile under solution-phase racemization could generate the enantiomeric imbalance to afford, in combination with the amplification of chirality, an enantioenriched product in every case.
1115	Among the 73 experiments that were carried out, d- and l-enriched isomers occurred 36 and 37 times, respectively.
1116	This stochastic behavior, under achiral or racemic starting conditions, meets the requirements of the spontaneous absolute asymmetric Strecker synthesis.
1117	The implications of the present results for the origin of chirality of α-amino acids are discussed.
1118	Cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) agonists of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) are a promising class of immunotherapeutics that activate innate immunity to increase tumour immunogenicity.
1119	However, the efficacy of CDNs is limited by drug delivery barriers, including poor cellular targeting, rapid clearance and inefficient transport to the cytosol where STING is localized.
1120	Here, we describe STING-activating nanoparticles (STING-NPs)-rationally designed polymersomes for enhanced cytosolic delivery of the endogenous CDN ligand for STING, 2'3' cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP).
1121	STING-NPs increase the biological potency of cGAMP, enhance STING signalling in the tumour microenvironment and sentinel lymph node, and convert immunosuppressive tumours to immunogenic, tumoricidal microenvironments.
1122	This leads to enhanced therapeutic efficacy of cGAMP, inhibition of tumour growth, increased rates of long-term survival, improved response to immune checkpoint blockade and induction of immunological memory that protects against tumour rechallenge.
1123	We validate STING-NPs in freshly isolated human melanoma tissue, highlighting their potential to improve clinical outcomes of immunotherapy.
1124	This study focuses on career development processes and options for older workers in South Korea and explores how career coaching enhances their career development efforts and transition needs.
1125	The purpose of this study is to investigate the structural relationship between older employees' goal-setting, self-efficacy, and job-search behavior mediated by career coaching.
1126	A total of 249 participants were recruited in a metropolitan city in South Korea.
1127	Based on the literature review, hypotheses were developed and tested on the structural model and the following findings were revealed.
1128	First, the findings indicate a positive effect of self-efficacy on older workers' job-search behavior.
1129	Second, the value of career coaching was found to affect older workers' job-search behavior in the South Korean context.
1130	Third, career-goal commitment alone did not have a positive significant effect on job-search behavior, but it was influential through the mediating process of the perceived quality of the career coaching program provided by an employment center in South Korea.
1131	A series of derivatives of pyridine were designed through substituting hydrogen atoms by nitro groups systematically.
1132	By using the density functional theory at B3PW91/6-311++G(d,p)//MP2/311++G(d,p) level, heats of formation, bond orders, and bond dissociation energies were calculated to explore the thermodynamic stabilities of title molecules.
1133	Furthermore, the regularity of stability was explained based on the electronic population.
1134	Our results indicated that title molecules had enough stability to exist.
1135	To evaluate the potential usage as a high-energy-density molecule, the detonation pressure and detonation velocity were explored by using the semi-empirical Kamlet-Jacobs equation and excellent detonation character was confirmed.
1136	Overall consideration of the thermal stability and energetic character, four molecules (2,3,4,5-tetranitropyridine, 2,3,5,6-tetranitropyridine, 2,4,5,6-tetranitrop-pyridine, 2,3,4,5,6-pentanitropyridine) were confirmed to be better than RDX and filtered as potential energetic molecules.
1137	Green synthesis of high-molecular-weight isosorbide-based polycarbonate (PIC) with excellent properties is a tremendous challenge, which is profoundly influenced by the precursor.
1138	Herein, we employed an eco-friendly catalyst to achieve the more reactive PIC precursor dicarboxymethyl isosorbide (DC) selectivity of 99.0% through the transesterfication reaction of isosorbide with dimethyl carbonate (DMC), which is the indispensable stage of one-pot green synthesis of PIC, playing a critical role in insight into the polymerization mechanism of polymers synthesis by melt transesterfication reaction.
1139	For this, a series of 4-substituted phenolate ionic liquids (ILs) were developed as a new type of high-efficiency catalyst for this reaction.
1140	These homogeneous ILs exhibit outstanding catalytic performance.
1141	The DC selectivity is gradually increasing with the decrease of basicity of ILs, among of which trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium 4-iodophenolate ([P66614][4-I-Phen]) shows the highest catalytic activity.
1142	Additionally, according to the experiment and DFT calculations results, a plausible nucleophilic activation mechanism was put forward, which confirmed that the reaction was activated through formation of H-bond and electrostatic interactions with IL catalyst.
1143	This strategy of tunable basicity and structure of anions in ILs affords an opportunity to develop other ILs for transesterfication reaction, thereby conveniently providing a variety of polymers via a greener synthetic pathway.
1144	An innovative tungsten-based multifunctional nanoplatform composed of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified tungsten nitride nanoparticles (WN NPs) is constructed for tumor treatment.
1145	The PEG-WN NPs not only possess strong near-infrared (NIR) absorbance, high photothermal conversion efficiency, and excellent photothermal stability, but also effectively inhibit tumor cells upon 808 nm laser irradiation.
1146	After coating with thiolated (2-hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin (MUA-CD) on the surface, such a nanoplatform can also be used for drug delivery (such as DOX) and presents a synergistic tumor inhibition effect both in vitro and in vivo.
1147	Furthermore, the PEG-WN NPs present good contrasting capability for X-ray computed tomography (CT) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging.
1148	With PA/CT imaging, the tumor can be accurately positioned for precise treatment.
1149	It is worth mentioning that PEG-WN NPs are biodegradable and could be effectively excreted from the body with no appreciable toxicity in vivo.
1150	It is expected that this biocompatible multifunctional nanoplatform can serve as a potential candidate for tumor treatment in future clinical applications.
1151	The mitochondrial proteome encompasses more than a thousand proteins, which are encoded by the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes.
1152	Mitochondrial biogenesis and network health relies on maintenance of protein import pathways and the protein-folding environment.
1153	Cell-extrinsic or -intrinsic stressors that challenge mitochondrial proteostasis negatively affect organellar function.
1154	During conditions of stress, cells use impaired protein import as a sensor for mitochondrial dysfunction to activate a stress response called the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt).
1155	UPRmt activation leads to an adaptive transcriptional program that promotes mitochondrial recovery, metabolic adaptations, and innate immunity.
1156	In this review, we discuss the regulation of UPRmt activation as well as its role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in physiological and pathological scenarios.
1157	Extramedullary hematopoeisis (EMH), also known as myeloid metaplasia can be seen in association with various hematological disorders.
1158	The common sites of EMH are liver, spleen and lymph nodes; but it can occur in almost any organ and in numerous locations.
1159	Involvement of the thyroid gland with EMH has rarely been reported.
1160	We present a case of EMH in the thyroid gland in an adult female diagnosed on fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) which further helped in revealing an underlying myeloproliferative neoplasm; chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
1161	Ecosystem service value (ESV) included some contributions of ecological environments to human health and living, and provide cultural and economic benefits for sustaining and fulfilling living organisms.
1162	The author selected the Ebinur lake Wetland Nature Reserve as our study site to analyze the spatial distribution and dynamics of ecosystem services, and we used 1972, 1998, 2006, 2014 and 2016 images to study land use/cover change (LUCC) over these periods.
1163	LUCC is one of the key drivers that affect ecosystem services.
1164	Firstly, in 1972-2030, land use/cover (LULC) significantly changed, with all LUCC practices increasing except for the categories of water area, bare land area and barren land/other.
1165	Secondly, changes in ESV were significant during the last 60 years.
1166	The total annual ESV in the study area decreased by 50.89% between 1972 and 2030, mostly attributable to the 6.82% growth of saline land, 0.09% growth of desert, 1% decrease of wetlands and 0.95% decrease of water bodies.
1167	Thirdly, the spatial-temporal variation of ESV was prominent.
1168	Spatial correlation was significant, and the degree of spatial clustering was relatively high in the study area, which was mainly distributed in the water body and wetland regions, and these high-value regions exhibited a decreasing trend.
1169	Low values occurred around the lake areas, which increased over time.
1170	Wine, a widely consumed beverage, comprises several biophenols that promote health.
1171	Flavonoids, majorly present in red wine, have been shown to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and immunomodulatory activities.
1172	Regular consumption of red wine (100 mL/day) is estimated to provide an average of 88 mg of flavonoids, whereas recent epidemiological studies indicate that wine is one of the major sources of flavonoid intake amongst wine lovers in European countries (providing an average intake of 291⁻374 mg/day of flavonoids).
1173	In addition to being antioxidants, in vitro studies suggest that flavonoids also have anti-allergic activities that inhibit IgE synthesis, activation of mast cells and basophils or other inflammatory cells, and production of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines.
1174	Furthermore, they affect the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into effector T cell subsets.
1175	Moreover, several studies have reported the benefits of flavonoids in allergic models such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, anaphylaxis, and food allergy; however, evidence in humans is limited to allergic rhinitis and respiratory allergy.
1176	Although further evaluation is required, it is expected that an appropriate intake of flavonoids may be beneficial in preventing, and eventually managing, allergic diseases.
1177	BACKGROUND-Oxytocin for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) prophylaxis is commonly administered by either intramuscular (IM) injection or intravenous (IV) infusion with both routes recommended equally and little discussion of potential differences between the two.
1178	This trial assesses the effectiveness and safety of 10 IU oxytocin administered as IM injection versus IV infusion and IV bolus during the third stage of labor for PPH prophylaxis.
1179	METHODS-In two tertiary level Egyptian maternity hospitals, women delivering vaginally without exposure to pre-delivery uterotonics were randomized to one of three prophylactic oxytocin administration groups after delivery of the baby.
1180	Blood loss was measured 1 h after delivery, and side effects were recorded.
1181	Primary outcomes were mean postpartum blood loss and proportion of women with postpartum blood loss ≥500 ml in this open-label, three-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial.
1182	RESULTS-Four thousand nine hundred thirteen eligible, consenting women were randomized.
1183	Compared to IM injection, mean blood loss was 5.9% less in the IV infusion arm (95% CI: -8.5, - 3.3) and 11.1% less in the IV bolus arm (95% CI: -14.7, - 7.8).
1184	Risk of postpartum blood loss ≥500 ml in the IV infusion arm was significantly less compared to IM injection (0.8% vs. 1.5%, RR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.91).
1185	No side effects were reported in any arm.
1186	CONCLUSIONS-Intravenous oxytocin is more effective than intramuscular injection for the prevention of PPH in the third stage of labor.
1187	Oxytocin delivered by IV bolus presents no safety concerns after vaginal delivery and should be considered a safe option for PPH prophylaxis.
1188	TRIAL REGISTRATION-clinicaltrials.gov # NCT01914419 , posted August 2, 2013.
1189	The paper introduces a novel hybrid network coding scheme in a three-node two-way relaying network in a wireless fading environment.
1190	The proposed hybrid scheme is featured by an opportunistic mechanism which employs one of the two network coding schemes, namely physical-layer network coding (PNC) and digital network coding (DNC), according to the instant rate requirement and dynamic channel condition.
1191	We first develop a close-form expression for the power consumption of the proposed scheme, which is further used to formulate a series of optimization problems under both symmetric and asymmetric traffic scenarios.
1192	Solving the optimization problems yields important system parameters that determine the optimal power allocations, time split between uplink and downlink transmissions as well as between PNC and DNC, respectively.
1193	We will discuss the possible overhead in the real implementation of the proposed scheme.
1194	Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to compare the performance of the proposed hybrid scheme with the conventional PNC and DNC scheme, respectively.
1195	We report on synthesis and characterization of the compounds <i>A</i><sub>6</sub>W<sub>4</sub>Al<sub>43</sub> (<i>A</i> = U and Pu), that form in the hexagonal Ho<sub>6</sub>Mo<sub>4</sub>Al<sub>43</sub> caged-structure family.
1196	The <i>A</i> ions reside within W/Al cages where the <i>A-A</i> nearest neighbors form dimers between adjacent W/Al cages, with U-U and Pu-Pu distances of 3.3892 angstrom and 3.4080 angstrom, respectively.
1197	While the W/Al networks provide environments similar to those of other cage-like materials (e.g.
1198	filled skutterudites), the atomic displacement parameters from single crystal x-ray diffraction measurements show that the <i>A</i>-ions do not exhibit rattling behavior.
1199	We find that there is site interchange disorder on one of the W/Al sites.
1200	Magnetic susceptibility measurements show that U<sub>6</sub>W<sub>4</sub>Al<sub>43</sub> displays anisotropic Curie-Weiss behavior where fits to the data yield an effective magnetic moment near 2.0 μ<sub>B</sub>/U.
1201	At low temperatures the magnetic susceptibility deviates from the Curie-Weiss temperature dependence and eventually saturates to a constant value.
1202	In contrast, Pu<sub>6</sub>W<sub>4</sub>Al<sub>43</sub> displays nearly temperature independent Pauli paramagnetism for all temperatures, as would be expected if the 5f-electrons are delocalized.
1203	The electrical resistivity for U<sub>6</sub>W<sub>4</sub>Al<sub>43</sub> increases slightly with decreasing temperature, suggesting that it is dominated by f-electronic hybridization effects and disorder scattering that originates from the W/Al site interchange.
1204	Specific heat measurements for U<sub>6</sub>W<sub>4</sub>Al<sub>43</sub> further reveal an enhanced electronic Sommerfeld coefficient that is consistent with a moderately enhanced charge carrier effective mass.
1205	Together these measurements expose these materials as hosts for unstable f-electron magnetism, where the novel cage-like structures control the phenomena through the spacing between the <i>A</i> ions.
1206	Through this combination of mild magnetism, the low cost elements of the Al-W cages, and chemical tunability that has been shown for related materials in the same structure, the <i>A</i><sub>6</sub>W<sub>4</sub>Al<sub>43</sub> compounds emerge as promising nuclear waste-forms for transuranics, while the wider family of materials makes an appealing environment for studying f-electron physics in a novel structure.
1207	It is known that connected and autonomous vehicles are capable of maintaining shorter headways and distances when they form platoons of vehicles.
1208	Thus, such technologies can result in increases in the capacities of traffic networks.
1209	Consequently, it is envisioned that their deployment will boost the network mobility.
1210	In this paper, we verify the validity of this impact under selfish routing behavior of drivers in traffic networks with mixed autonomy, i.e.
1211	traffic networks with both regular and autonomous vehicles.
1212	We consider a nonatomic routing game on a network with inelastic (fixed) demands for the set of network O/D pairs, and study how replacing a fraction of regular vehicles by autonomous vehicles will affect the mobility of the network.
1213	Using the well known US bureau of public roads (BPR) traffic delay models, we show that the resulting Wardrop equilibrium is not necessarily unique even in its weak sense for networks with mixed autonomy.
1214	We state the conditions under which the total network delay is guaranteed not to increase as a result of autonomy increase.
1215	However, we show that when these conditions do not hold, counter intuitive behaviors may occur: the total delay can grow by increasing the network autonomy.
1216	In particular, we prove that for networks with a single O/D pair, if the road degrees of asymmetry are homogeneous, the total delay is 1) unique, and 2) a nonincreasing continuous function of network autonomy fraction.
1217	We show that for heterogeneous degrees of asymmetry, the total delay is not unique, and it can further grow with autonomy increase.
1218	We demonstrate that similar behaviors may be observed in networks with multiple O/D pairs.
1219	We further bound such performance degradations due to the introduction of autonomy in homogeneous networks.
1220	Cat-scratch disease (CSD) is usually a self-limiting infection that in the majority of cases occurs as lymphadenitis in children who have been scratched or bitten by a cat.
1221	Rarely, Bartonella henselae is cause of fever of unknown origin (FUO), with dissemination to various organs, mimicking an inflammatory rather than a lymphoproliferative disease.
1222	This manuscript will present a case of thoracic manifestations of CSD in an immunocompetent 2-years baby without history of cat contact, with fever of unknown origin, investigated by chest CT and MRI.
1223	The growing use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for various applications requires ubiquitous and reliable connectivity for safe control and data exchange between these devices and ground terminals.
1224	Depending on the application, UAV-mounted wireless equipment can either be an aerial user equipment (AUE) that co-exists with the terrestrial users, or it can be a part of wireless infrastructure providing a range of services to the ground users.
1225	For instance, AUE can be used for real-time search and rescue and Aerial Base Station (ABS) can enhance coverage, capacity and energy efficiency of wireless networks.
1226	In both cases, UAV-based solutions are scalable, mobile, fast to deploy.
1227	However, several technical challenges have to be addressed.
1228	In this work, we present a tutorial on wireless communication with UAVs, taking into account a wide range of potential applications.
1229	The main goal of this work is to provide a complete overview of the main scenarios (AUE and ABS), channel and performance models, compare them, and discuss open research points.
1230	This work gives a comprehensive overview of the research done until now and depicts a comprehensive picture to foster new ideas and solutions while avoiding duplication of past work.
1231	We start by discussing the open challenges of wireless communication with UAVs.
1232	To give answers to the posed questions, we focus on the UAV communication basics, mainly providing the necessary channel modeling background and giving guidelines on how various channel models should be used.
1233	Next, theoretical, simulation- and measurement-based approaches, to address the key challenges for AUE usage, are presented.
1234	Moreover, in this work, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview on how UAV-mounted equipment can be used as a part of a communication network.
1235	Based on the theoretical analysis, we show how various network parameters can be optimized.
1236	HYPOTHESIS-Shear-banding of branched wormlike solutions is a topic of active investigation which has not been fully elucidated.
1237	Here, we surmise that flow-induced microstructuring in the shear banding regime is associated with spatial concentration gradients.
1238	EXPERIMENTS-The experiments focus on the flow-induced behavior of a CTAB/NaSal wormlike micellar system.
1239	A unique approach based on a microfluidic-spitter geometry, combined with particle-image velocimetry and high-speed video microscopy, is used to separate the streams flowing out from the core and the near wall zones of the microchannel.
1240	FINDINGS-Here, we present the first direct experimental evidence of the correlation between phase separation and shear banding.
1241	By increasing the pressure-drop across a microcapillary, the onset of a grainy texture close to the wall, showing a flow-induced demixing effect, is observed.
1242	We use a splitter to measure effluent streams from the center and the near-wall zones in terms of viscosity, conductance and dry mass.
1243	We observe that phase-separation induced by the flow correlates with chemical concentration gradients.
1244	This confirms our hypothesis that shear-induced local de-mixing of the system is strongly related to chemical concentration gradients.
1245	BACKGROUND-Parents' attitudes and beliefs in vaccination are important to understand for shaping vaccine acceptance and demand interventions.
1246	Little research has focused on developing a validated scale to measure parents' attitudes towards vaccinations in low and middle-income countries; Ghana provided an opportunity develop a caregiver vaccination attitudes scale (CVAS) validated against childhood vaccine compliance.
1247	METHODS-We conducted a cluster survey of 373 households with children aged 12-35 months of age from Northern Region, Ghana.
1248	Caregivers responded to 22 vaccination behavior and belief survey items and provided the child's vaccination status.
1249	In exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to assess CVAS content validity, we used parallel analysis to guide the number of factors to extract and principal axis factor analysis for factor extraction.
1250	Reliability of the scale was assessed using McDonald's Omega coefficient.
1251	Criterion validity of scale and subscales was assessed against receipt of vaccinations by 12 months of age and vaccination delay, using number of days undervaccinated.
1252	RESULTS-EFA of CVAS responses resulted in removing 11 of 22 survey items due to loadings <0.30 and development of a 5-factor structure with subscales for Vaccine-Preventable Disease (VPD) Awareness, Vaccine Benefits, Past Behavior, Vaccine Efficacy and Safety, and Trust.
1253	The 5 factors accounted for 69% of the common variance and omega coefficients were >0.73 for all subscales.
1254	Validity analysis indicated that for every unit increase in the parent's scale score, the odds of the child being vaccinated decreased by 0.58 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37, 0.68) and the number of days under-vaccinated increased by 86 (95%CI: 28, 143).
1255	The final 3-factor scale included Vaccine Benefits, Past Behavior, and Vaccine Efficacy and Safety.
1256	DISCUSSION-The final CVAS included three factors associated with vaccine compliance in Ghana, although several survey items suggested for use in vaccine acceptance scales were dropped.
1257	Replicating this study in several country settings will provide additional evidence to assist in refining a tool for use in routine vaccine acceptance and demand surveillance efforts.
1258	BACKGROUND-Down syndrome (DS) is characterised by premature ageing that affects selected organ systems, and persons with this condition can present patterns of co-morbidities and deficits often observed in the older population without DS.
1259	However, information on the characteristics of adult persons with DS is limited.
1260	The objective of the study is to describe characteristics of adults with DS collected with a standardised, comprehensive assessment instrument.
1261	METHODS-Cross-sectional study.
1262	Four hundred thirty adults with DS (age range 18/75 years) from three countries (Italy, n = 95; USA, n = 175; and Canada, n = 160).
1263	A standardised assessment instrument (interRAI intellectual disability) was used to assess sample characteristics.
1264	RESULTS-Mean age ranged from 35.2 (standard deviation 12.0) years in the US sample to 48.8 (standard deviation 9.0) years in the Canadian sample.
1265	Most participants in the Italian and US sample were living in private homes, while more than half of those in the Canadian sample were institutionalised.
1266	Prevalences of geriatric conditions, including cognitive deficits, disability in the common activities of daily living, symptoms of withdrawal or anhedonia, aggressive behaviour, communication problems, falls and hearing problems were high in the study sample.
1267	Gastrointestinal symptoms, skin and dental problems and obesity were also frequently observed.
1268	CONCLUSIONS-Adults with DS present with a high level of complexity, which may suggest the need for an approach based on a comprehensive assessment and management that can provide adequate care.
1269	Further research is needed to understand better the effectiveness of such an approach in the DS population.
1270	OBJECTIVES-The distinction between overuse and appropriate use of the ICU hinges on whether a patient would benefit from ICU care.
1271	We sought to test 1) whether physicians agree about which types of patients benefit from ICU care and 2) whether estimates of ICU benefit are influenced by factors unrelated to severity of illness.
1272	DESIGN-Randomized study.
1273	SETTING-Online vignettes.
1274	SUBJECTS-U.S. critical care physicians.
1275	INTERVENTIONS-Physicians were provided with eight vignettes of hypothetical patients.
1276	Each vignette had a single patient or hospital factor randomized across participants (four factors related and four unrelated to severity of illness).
1277	MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS-The primary outcome was the estimate of ICU benefit, assessed with a 4-point Likert-type scale.
1278	In total, 1,223 of 8,792 physicians volunteered to participate (14% recruitment rate).
1279	Physician agreement of ICU benefit was poor (mean intraclass correlation coefficient for each vignette: 0.06; range: 0-0.18).
1280	There were no vignettes in which more than two thirds of physicians agreed about the extent to which a patient would benefit from ICU care.
1281	Increasing severity of illness resulted in greater estimated benefit of ICU care.
1282	Among factors unrelated to severity of illness, physicians felt ICU care was more beneficial when told one ICU bed was available than if ICU bed availability was unmentioned.
1283	Physicians felt ICU care was less beneficial when family was present than when family presence was unmentioned.
1284	The patient's age, but not race/ethnicity, also impacted estimates of ICU benefit.
1285	CONCLUSIONS-Estimates of ICU benefit are widely dissimilar and influenced by factors unrelated to severity of illness, potentially resulting in inconsistent allocation of ICU care.
1286	Objective: To understand the epidemiological and etiological characteristics of outbreaks on acute gastroenteritis caused by sapovirus (SaV) worldwide.
1287	Methods: Literature about the outbreaks on acute gastroenteritis caused by SaV were retrieved from the databases including WanFang, CNKI, PubMed and Web of Science after evaluation.
1288	Time, geography, setting and population distributions of outbreaks, transmission mode, SaV genotype and clinical characteristics of the patients were analyzed.
1289	Results: A total of 34 papers about SaV were included, involving 146 outbreaks occurred between October 1976 and April 2016.
1290	In these papers, 138 outbreaks were reported on the related months.
1291	All these outbreaks occurred in northern hemisphere.
1292	SaV outbreaks occurred all year around, but mainly in cold season, the incidence was highest in December (25 outbreaks) and lowest in in August (2 outbreaks).
1293	Most outbreaks were reported by Japan, followed by Canada, the United States of America and the Netherlands.
1294	There were 141 outbreaks for which the occurring settings were reported, child-care settings were most commonly reported setting (48/141, 34.04%), followed by long-term care facility (41/141, 29.08%) and hospital (16/141, 11.35%).
1295	Clinical symptoms of 1 704 cases in 31 outbreaks were reported, with the most common symptom was diarrhea (1 331/1 704, 78.12%), followed by nausea (829/1 198, 69.20%), abdominal pain (840/1 328, 63.25%), vomiting (824/1 704, 48.36%) and fever (529/1 531, 34.53%).
1296	Genotypes of SaV were determined for 119 outbreaks.
1297	GⅠ(51/119, 42.86%) and GⅣ (45/119, 37.82%) were predominant.
1298	The outbreaks of GⅣ SaV increased suddenly in 2007, and the outbreaks of GⅠ SaV mainly occurred in 2008 and during 2011-2013.
1299	Conclusions: SaV outbreaks were reported mainly by developed countries, with most outbreaks occurred in cold season, in child-care settings and long term care facility.
1300	GⅠ and GⅣ were the most common genotypes of SaV.
1301	Prevention and control of SaV outbreak in China seemed relatively weak, and it is necessary to conduct related training and to strengthen the SaV outbreak surveillance in areas where service is in need.
1302	Hydroxyl fatty acids (HFAs) are used in widely diverse industrial applications, healthy functional foods, artificial food flavorings, and alcoholic beverages.
1303	A lactic acid bacterium (LAB), Lactobacillus sakei, hydroxylates oleic acid.
1304	Furthermore, the hydroxyl fatty acid was identified by GC-MS as 10-hydroxystearic acid.
1305	The Lactobacillus sakei hydroxylated more than 90% of the oleic acid in the medium at 15 °C after 30-48 h. The hydroxyl enzyme needs a coenzyme for an electron donor as NADPH.
1306	The enzyme is useful for assay with monitoring NADPH concentration used an A340 device.
1307	The hydroxylate fatty acids converted by LAB lactonize aroma lactone from commercial yeast strains, which can be detected directly by scent.
1308	Commercial beer brewing yeast T-58 produced the highest concentration of aroma lactone from hydroxyl fatty acids.
1309	Furthermore, the aroma lactone is identified by GC-MS as gamma-dodecalactone.
1310	The ratio of conversion is 87%.
1311	These results suggest that the lactonization conversion system is useful to hydroxylate fatty acids for alcoholic beverages.
1312	OBJECTIVE-The cancer etiology in children and adolescents is largely different with that in adults, and the description in epidemiology still remains deficiency.
1313	Therefore, we described the cancer incidence and related epidemiological features in children and adolescents to provide clues for etiological studies.
1314	METHODS-Cancer incidence stratified by age, gender, and areas was calculated using data extracted from population-based cancer registries in Henan Province, China.
1315	All cancer among children aged 0-19 years were reclassified according to category criteria of the International Classification of Childhood Cancer, 3rd Edition (ICCC-3).
1316	Age-standardized rate (WSR) was calculated using Segi's world standardized population by the direct method, and it was expressed per million person-years.
1317	RESULTS-The crude cancer incidence and mortality were 87.56 and 36.32 per million person-years among children aged 0-19 years, and the WSRs slightly changed compared with crude incidence and mortality, and they were 87.36 and 35.46 per million person-years.
1318	Leukemia and central nervous system neoplasms (CNS) were the most common cancer categories both in children aged 0-14 years and in adolescents aged 15-19 years in regardless of gender and areas.
1319	Tiny difference of incidence and mortality existed in different age groups across 0-14 years; however, they were higher in adolescents aged 15-19 years than that in children aged 0-14 years.
1320	Among children aged 0-19 years, the cancer incidence and mortality were predominant in boys, and the sex ratio was 1.19; however, it was varied by diagnostic categories.
1321	CONCLUSION-This is the first study that described the cancer incidence and mortality among children aged 0-19 in Henan Province, and it would help researchers to understand the burden and epidemiological characteristics of childhood cancer, and hence suggested clues for the etiological studies.
1322	Climate change will have large consequences for flooding frequencies in freshwater systems.
1323	In interaction with anthropogenic activities (flow regulation, channel restoration and catchment land-use) this will both increase flooding and drought across the world.
1324	Like in many other ecosystems facing changed environmental conditions, it remains difficult to predict the rate and trajectory of vegetation responses to changed conditions.
1325	Given that critical ecosystem services (e.g.
1326	bank stabilization, carbon subsidies to aquatic communities or water purification) depend on riparian vegetation composition, it is important to understand how and how fast riparian vegetation responds to changing flooding regimes.
1327	We studied vegetation changes over 19 growing seasons in turfs that were transplanted in a full-factorial design between three riparian elevations with different flooding frequencies.
1328	We found that (1) some transplanted communities may have developed into an alternative stable state and were still different from the target community, and (2) pathways of vegetation change were highly directional but alternative trajectories did occur, (3) changes were rather linear but faster when flooding frequencies increased than when they decreased, and (4) we observed fastest changes in turfs when proxies for mortality and colonization were highest.
1329	These results provide rare examples of alternative transient trajectories and stable states under field conditions, which is an important step towards understanding their drivers and their frequency in a changing world.

1332	The topical review focuses on calculating ionization energies (IE), or electronic polarons in quasi-particle terminology, in large disordered systems, e.g.
1333	for a solute dissolved in a molecular solvent.
1334	The simplest estimate of the ionization energy is provided by one-electron energies in the Hartree-Fock theory, but the calculated quantities are not accurate.
1335	Density functional theory as many-body theory provides a principal opportunity for calculating one-electron energies including correlation and relaxation effects, i.e.
1336	the true energies of electronic polarons.
1337	We argue that such a principal possibility materializes within the concept of optimally tuned range-separated hybrid functionals (OT-RSH).
1338	We describe various schemes for optimal tuning.
1339	Importantly, the OT-RSH scheme is investigated for systems capped with dielectric continuum, providing a consistent picture on the QM/dielectric boundary.
1340	Finally, some limitations and open issues of the OT-RSH approach are addressed.
1341	Objective-To explore a simple and rapid pathological slices method to observe the porous structure and the composition distribution of composite materials.
1342	Methods-Taking polyurethane/small intestinal submucosa (PU/SIS) composite as an example, PU/SIS was OCT-embedded and sliced into sections by frozen section technology, after which general observation of the section integrity was carried out.
1343	After dyed with water-soluble eosin in alcoholic solution, the staining effect and the porous structure of the composite were observed under light field microscope.
1344	Sections were sealed with five different sealing methods.
1345	Group A: sealing piece using glycerogelatin method; group B: anhydrous alcohol dehydration→transparency using TO transparent reagent→sealing piece using neutral quick drying glue; group C: color separation using deionized water→air-drying→sealing piece using neutral quick drying glue; group D: air-drying→transparency using TO transparent reagent→sealing piece using neutral quick drying glue; group E: air-drying→sealing piece using neutral quick drying glue.
1346	Then, the morphology and the components distribution of the composite were observed under light field microscope, and the simple and feasible method was selected as optimum method.
1347	Results-From general observation, the frozen section of the PU/SIS composite, which was 6 μm in thickness, was complete and continuous.
1348	Although the outline of the material and the porous structure in the sections could be observed clearly under light field microscope, the two components still could not be identified by using eosin staining method.
1349	After sealing piece, the material components in groups A, B, and C still could not be identified or be dissolved and deformed; the morphology of the material in groups D and E were preserved and the two components in the composite were clearly visible.
1350	Conclusion-The morphology and the components distribution of PU/SIS frozen sections can be characterized after soluble eosin staining and neutral quick drying glue sealing.
1351	BACKGROUND:-Several radiographic signs have been described to assess acetabular coverage.
1352	However, plain radiographs only have 2 dimensions (2D) and cannot accurately show acetabular coverage.
1353	QUESTIONS/PURPOSES:-We developed the ACX Dynamics software to calculate the radial centre-edge angle (RCEA), which represents the acetabular coverage of the femoral head at each acetabular edge point on the radial plane.
1354	This study validated the accuracy of the RCEA, as calculated by ACX Dynamics, as a quantitative parameter for acetabular coverage.
1355	PATIENTS AND METHODS:-We reviewed the anteroposterior (AP) pelvic radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of 650 hips from 325 patients who presented with chief complaint of symptoms at the hip joint.
1356	Of 109 hip radiographs (68 patients) that satisfied the criteria, 50 randomised, blinded AP pelvic radiographs were chosen.
1357	We determined the absolute RCEA difference (°) [= RCEA ACX (°) - RCEA CT (°)], determined the correlation between RCEA ACX (°) and RCEA CT (°), and examined the RCEA's intra-observer and inter-observer reliability in 50 hips.
1358	RESULTS:-The absolute RCEA difference from A45° to P75° was 1.9-3.1°.
1359	The correlation between the RCEA ACX (°) and RCEA CT (°) was > 0.7 in all lesions ( p < 0.001).
1360	Using the intraclass correlation coefficient, the intra-observer reliability of the RCEA was 0.83-0.97 in the whole range, which is a highly reproducible and reasonable parameter, and the inter-observer reliability was > 0.80 in A45°-P0°.
1361	CONCLUSIONS:-The RCEA ACX (°) can be used as a simple quantitative parameter for assessing acetabular coverage using AP pelvic radiograph.
1362	We read with interest the manuscript by Thompson et al recently published in Gut highlighting the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) within the stromal compartment of gastric adenocarcinomas (GC).
1363	This study showed that PD-L1 is rather expressed by stromal than neoplastic cells and primarily at the tumour margin of PD-L1 GC.
1364	Moreover, they identified a high proportion of CD8 T cells within these areas that, in contrast to previous studies, correlated with worse progression-free survival and overall survival.
1365	We fully agree with their findings because of very similar results obtained regarding PD-L1 expression in a well-characterised cohort of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC).
1366	Immunohistochemical PD-L1 staining revealed marked PD-L1 expression in 17 of 59 cases (30.4%) (figure 1A).
1367	Furthermore, pan-cytokeratin/PD-L1 costainings validated that in 76.5% of the PD-L1 itive subgroup PD-L1 is predominantly or exclusively expressed by stromal cells (figure 1B).
1368	In line with the findings in GC tissues, PD-L1 areas in PDAC tissues were mainly located at the tumour margin and showed high CD3 T cell infiltration (online supplementary figure 1).
1369	Notably, immunostaining of serial tissue sections demonstrated that CD8 T cells and CD68 tumour-associated macrophages (TAM) represent the major immune cell populations within these areas while CD4 T cells were almost absent (online supplementary figure 1).
1370	Moreover, the prominent coincidence of CD68 and PD-L1 in situ as well as preliminary results with in vitro differentiated macrophages indicates that PD-L1 is predominantly expressed by TAM in dependence on T cell secreted cytokines (unpublished data).
1371	Based on our findings, we agree with the conclusion by Thompson et al and others that in certain tumours PD-L1 expression is associated with a ‘T cell inflamed type’ 3–5 which is, however, compromised in its function.
1372	Thus, in these cases PD-1/ PD-L1 blockade might be more beneficial to restore T cell reactivity than in tumours in which PD-L1 expression is restricted to neoplastic cells in the absence of effector T cell infiltration.
1373	Therefore, we agree with Thompson et al that more precise studies on PD-L1 expression in neoplastic and stromal cells considering intratumoural localisation and stromal composition are needed to better understand its tumour biological relevance and, thereby, develop diagnostically conclusive approaches for improved patient stratification.
1374	In line with the findings by Thompson et al our results indicate that the different clinical outcomes of the patients within our cohort (87% staged as T3N1M0) might be explained by differences in PD-L1 expression and the extent of immune cell infiltrates.
1375	In general, the assessment of PD-L1 status in solid tumours by current methods is controversially discussed.
1376	Several preclinical studies proposed PD-L1 expression as a prognostic marker but most clinical trials revealed a rather poor or absent correlation of treatment responses with PD-L1 status classified by established methods.
1377	Thus, clinical indication for application of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies has been mainly defined by the failure of standard oncological treatment regimens, yet.
1378	Encouraged by the findings of Thompson et al and our own data, indicating that tumour-associated PD-L1 expression highly varies in terms of cellular origin, intratumoural localisation and expression level (unpublished data), we are currently developing a novel scoring system that comprehensively considers all these facets.
1379	Thereby, we hope to provide a tool for improved PD-L1 classification in PDAC and better prediction of treatment responses to PD-1/PD-L1 targeted approaches in future clinical trials.
1380	INTRODUCTION- Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is a rare bleeding disorder.
1381	The disease is caused by the lack or dysfunction of platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (integrin αIIbβ3) which is essential for platelet aggregation.
1382	Bleeding episodes are usually managed by platelet transfusions.
1383	Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) is a common adjunct or alternative treatment option.
1384	OBJECTIVE- This article evaluates GT patients' response to increasing concentrations of rFVIIa using an ex vivo thrombin generation assay to elaborate the knowledge in which rFVIIa treats a platelet dysfunction for bleeding episodes and preoperative management.
1385	MATERIALS AND METHODS- Twenty-four GT patients in a non-bleeding state were enrolled into the study.
1386	Thrombin generation was measured in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in the presence of 0.7 to 7.0 µg/mL rFVIIa.
1387	Clinical data of rFVIIa used to treat GT patients' bleeding episodes was collected, and patients' follow-up course was documented.
1388	RESULTS- Thrombin generation was significantly decreased in GT patients compared with controls.
1389	An individual response to rFVIIa spiking was noted in GT patients' PRP.
1390	In the majority of patients, a significant improvement in thrombin generation was already demonstrated with low concentrations (0.7 µg/mL) of rFVIIa.
1391	CONCLUSION- Thrombin generation is improved in the majority of GT patients following ex vivo spiking with rFVIIa.
1392	The magnitude of this improvement is individual and was noted at low concentrations of rFVIIa.
1393	There is a need for a prospective clinical trial to find the optimal doses or rFVIIa for treatment of GT patients.
1394	Healthy coral reefs play a vital role in maintaining biodiversity in tropical marine ecosystems.
1395	Remote imaging techniques have facilitated the scientific investigations of these intricate ecosystems, particularly at depths beyond 10 m where SCUBA diving techniques are not time or cost efficient.
1396	With millions of digital images of the seafloor collected using remotely operated vehicles and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), manual annotation of these data by marine experts is a tedious, repetitive, and time-consuming task.
1397	It takes 10–30 min for a marine expert to meticulously annotate a single image.
1398	Automated technology to monitor the health of the oceans would allow for transformational ecological outcomes by standardizing methods to detect and identify species.
1399	This paper aims to automate the analysis of large available AUV imagery by developing advanced deep learning tools for rapid and large-scale automatic annotation of marine coral species.
1400	Such an automated technology would greatly benefit marine ecological studies in terms of cost, speed, and accuracy.
1401	To this end, we propose a deep learning based classification method for coral reefs and report the application of the proposed technique to the automatic annotation of unlabeled mosaics of the coral reef in the Abrolhos Islands, W.A., Australia.
1402	Our proposed method automatically quantified the coral coverage in this region and detected a decreasing trend in coral population, which is in line with conclusions drawn by marine ecologists.
1403	The use of antibacterial agents, triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC), in personal care products can result in direct human exposure.
1404	Density Functional Theory (DFT) was utilized to evaluate the electronic properties of TCS and TCC, and the determined energetically accessible transitions across the HOMO-LUMO gap.
1405	Choosing pepsin as a model protein, we explored the binding effects of TCS or TCC on pepsin by molecular docking and dynamic simulations.
1406	Titration of pepsin with TCS or TCC at pH 2.2 led to quenching of the pepsin intrinsic fluorescence via formation of a ground-state complex.
1407	The binding constants of the TCS/TCC-pepsin complexes, determined at 296 K, were (7.053 ± 0.030) × 104 M-1 and (6.233 ± 0.060) × 104 M-1, respectively.
1408	Analysis of the thermodynamic properties of each system at various temperatures demonstrated that the binding reaction is a spontaneous process driven by hydrophobic interactions.
1409	The spectroscopic results revealed that changes in the secondary structure of pepsin are induced by TCS or TCC.
1410	The thermal stability of pepsin was evaluated, and no change in thermal stability was observed upon substrate binding.
1411	However, the binding of either TCS or TCC to pepsin effectively reduced the activity.
1412	Ugi four component reaction (Ugi-4CR) isocyanide-based multicomponent reactions were used to synthesize diN-substituted glycyl-phenylalanine (diNsGF) derivatives.
1413	All of the synthesized compounds were characterized by spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques.
1414	In order to evaluate potential biological applications, the synthesized compounds were tested in computational models that predict the bioactivity of organic molecules by using only bi-dimensional molecular information.
1415	The diNsGF derivatives were predicted as cholinesterase inhibitors.
1416	Experimentally, all of the synthesized diNsGF derivatives showed moderate inhibitory activities against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and poor activities against butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE).
1417	Compound 7a has significant activity and selectivity against AChE, which reveals that the diNsGF scaffold could be improved to reach novel candidates by combining other chemical components of the Ugi-4CR in a high-throughput combinatorial screening experiment.
1418	Molecular docking experiments of diNsGF derivatives inside AChE suggest that these compounds placed the phenylalanine group at the peripheral site of AChE.
1419	The orientations and chemical interactions of diNsGF derivatives were analyzed, and the changeable groups were identified for future exploration of novel candidates that could lead to the improvement of diNsGF derivative inhibitory activities.
1420	In this study, different solvent extracts (methanol, dichloromethane and n-hexane) from aerial and stem parts of Buxus papillosa C.K.
1421	Schneid (Buxaceae) were investigated for a panoply of bioassays.
1422	Biological profiles were established by determining antioxidant and enzyme inhibition profiles.
1423	Toxicity was tested using MTT cell viability assay on five different human cancer cell lines i.e, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, CaSki, DU-145 and SW-480.
1424	For chemical fingerprinting, total bioactive contents and UHPLC-MS secondary metabolites profile were determined.
1425	Generally, both aerial and stem methanol extracts had highest total bioactive contents, radical scavenging and reducing power potential.
1426	DCM and n-hexane extracts were found to be most active for total antioxidant and metal chelating activity.
1427	The UHPLC-MS analysis of methanol extracts revealed the presence of several phenolic, flavonoid, alkaloid, saponin and depsipeptide derivatives.
1428	All the extracts were significantly active against butyrylcholinesterase, whereas moderate inhibition was observed for acetylcholinesterase, α-glucosidase and urease.
1429	Similarly, a considerable level of cytotoxicity was observed against all the tested cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 26 to 225.9 μg/mL.
1430	Aerial methanol and stem n-hexane extracts were found to be most cytotoxic.
1431	Principal component analysis was also performed to find any possible correlation between biological activities and total bioactive contents.
1432	On the basis of our findings, B. papillosa may be considered as promising source of bioactive molecules.
1433	In current research, the multi walled carbon nanotubes was functionalized with mercapto-melamine groups by covalent grafting of f-CNT with ethylenediamine, cyanuric chloride and 2-mercaptoethanol for introducing mercapto functional groups on the surface of nanotube.
1434	Consequently, the thiolated MWCNTs were applied to deposing Pd nanoparticles.
1435	The results of FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, powder XRD, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDX) and CHN analysis showed the successful synthesis of nanocatalyst.
1436	The scanning and transmission electron microscopes (SEM and TEM) were used to study the morphologies of the nanocatalyst.
1437	Moreover, the (MWCNTs/CC-SH/Pd) nanocatalyst was effectively applied in Buchwald-Hartwig C-N cross coupling reaction with wide variety of functionalized substrates.
1438	A variety of aryl amines were prepared through reaction of aryl halides (chloride, bromide and iodide) and amines in high yields.
1439	Remarkably, the new catalyst could be reused for six recycles without change in its catalytic activity.
1440	The long-term performance degradation of five different types of commercial crystalline silicon (c-Si) photovoltaic (PV) modules (one sample for each type) in the tropics, or more specifically the tropical rainforest climate “Af” by the Köppen climate classification (Singapore), is investigated over a period of seven years, based on outdoor <italic>I–V</italic> measurements at 10-s intervals.
1441	The degradation rates of these c-Si PV modules, based on the temperature-corrected performance ratio, range from –0.03 to –0.47%/year, which satisfy the products’ performance warranty.
1442	Further analysis of the short-circuit current (<italic>I</italic><sub>sc</sub>), open-circuit voltage, and fill factor for these modules shows that the performance degradation is mainly attributed to the <italic>I</italic><sub>sc</sub> loss.
1443	The possible causes of the module performance deterioration are also discussed.
1444	In plants, RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM)-mediated transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) is a natural antiviral defense against geminiviruses.
1445	Several geminiviral proteins have been shown to target the enzymes related to methylcycle or histone modification; however, it remains largely unknown whether and by which mechanism geminiviruses directly inhibit RdDM-mediated TGS.
1446	In this study, we show that Cotton Leaf Curl Multan virus (CLCuMuV) V2 directly interacts with NbAGO4 and the L76S mutation in V2 (V2L76S) abolishes such interaction.
1447	We further showed that V2, but not V2L76S can suppresses RdDM and TGS.
1448	Silencing of NbAGO4 inhibits TGS, reduces viral methylation level and enhances CLCuMuV DNA accumulation.
1449	In contrast, the V2L76S substitution mutant attenuates CLCuMuV infection and enhances viral methylation level.
1450	These findings reveal that CLCuMuV V2 contributes to viral infection by interaction with NbAGO4 to suppress RdDM-mediated TGS in plants.IMPORTANCE In plants, RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway is a natural antiviral defense mechanism against geminiviruses.
1451	However, how geminiviruses counter RdDM-mediated defense is largely unknown.
1452	Our findings reveal that Cotton Leaf Curl Multan virus V2 contributes to viral infection by interaction with NbAGO4 to suppress RNA-directed DNA methylation-mediated transcriptional gene silencing in plants.
1453	Our work provides the first evidence that a geminiviral protein is able to directly target core RdDM component to counter RdDM-mediated TGS antiviral defense in plants, which extends our current understanding of viral counter- host antiviral defense.
1454	Background: The use of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-based testing methods is increasing in the food sector.
1455	DNA analyses can be a helpful tool for the analysis of many food products and can address some of the present concerns about adulteration and authenticity.
1456	Several analytical methods have been proposed to answer the specific topic of species composition in foods.
1457	Objective: The aim is to show that Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a suitable tool for food analysis including spices, herbs, seasoning, etc.
1458	Method: In the present study, we show how an internal NGS workflow was setup and tested for species composition in real food seasoning samples.
1459	Results: Commercial samples of different spice and herb mixtures were analysed by our internal developed NGS workflow.
1460	The results obtained will be discussed based on the labeling of the products relative to the type of sample and species mixtures.
1461	Conclusions: Here we show that our internal NGS workflow can be successfully applied in complex commercial samples.
1462	Highlights: NGS can become a powerfull and reliable tool for authentication of spices and herbs products.
1463	The direct catalytic α-amidoalkylation of dihydroquinolines with aldehydes bearing oxygen functionalities at different positions in a Mannich-type reaction has been studied.
1464	β-Alkoxy-aldehyde 1d gave high enantioselectivity, albeit with an inherently poor diastereoselectivity, while the use of α-alkoxy aldehydes 1c was detrimental also to enantioselectivity.
1465	Mannich-type reactions have been studied for the first time using new chiral carbohydrate-derived aldehydes 1a,b showing a reactivity markedly influenced by the presence of water.
1466	The chiral glycidic backbone showed a slight but significant influence on the overall stereochemical outcome only when present in α-position of the aldehyde.
1467	The absolute stereochemistry of the products was studied by electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra and compared with theoretical calculations.
1468	ECD analysis easily provides the absolute configuration of 1,2-dihydroquinoline derivatives such as quinoline-1(2H)-carboxylates.
1469	Influence of different drying method on yield, physicochemical and functional properties of gelatin from rohu (Labeo rohita) swim bladder were investigated.
1470	Freeze-drying presented the highest gelatin yield (54.51 g/100 g, dry weight basis), followed by vacuum-drying (48.95 g/100 g) and spray-drying (41.76 g/100 g), respectively (P < 0.05).
1471	All gelatin samples showed glycine as the major amino acid followed by proline, glutamic acid, alanine, arginine and hydroxyproline, respectively.
1472	Freeze-dried gelatin (FDG) and spray-dried gelatin (SDG) showed α (α1 and α2), β-chains and γ-chain as the predominant components, whereas an absence of β- and γ-chains found in vacuum-dried gelatin (VDG).
1473	FTIR spectra revealed that the loss of the triple-helix was found in all gelatins which indicated the conversion of collagen to soluble gelatin.
1474	FDG and SDG had the highest surface hydrophobicity, protein solubility, emulsifying, foaming and gelation property than VDG (P < 0.05).
1475	Moreover, SDG showed slightly higher surface hydrophobicity, protein solubility, emulsifying and foaming properties as compared to FDG (P < 0.05).
1476	However, no significant difference was found in gelation properties of FDG and SDG (P > 0.05).
1477	Therefore, freeze-drying or spray-drying could be an appropriate drying method for preparation of gelatin from rohu swim bladder with better functionalities.
1478	The present study evaluated the toxicity of metal contamination in soils from an art glass factory in Småland Sweden using a Caenorhabditis elegans nematode model.
1479	The aim of the study was to chemically analyze the soil samples and study the biological effects of water-soluble leachates on the nematodes using different physiological endpoints.
1480	The total metal content showed that As, Cd and Pb were at levels above the guideline values for soils in areas around the factory.
1481	Less than 10% of the total metal content in the soil was found in the water-soluble leachates, however, Al, As, Fe and Pb remained higher than the guideline values for safe drinking water.
1482	Exposure of C. elegans to the water-soluble leachates, at both post-hatching larvae stage (L1-young adult) for 48 h and at the young adult stage (L4) for 6 h, showed significant gene alteration.
1483	Although the nematodes did not exhibit acute lethality, lifespan was significantly reduced upon exposure.
1484	C. elegans also showed altered gene expression associated with stress response and fat metabolism, as well as enhanced accumulation of body fat.
1485	The study highlighted the significance of assessing environmental samples using a combination of gene expression analysis, fatty acid metabolism and lifespan for providing valuable insight into the negative impact of metals.
1486	The altered fat metabolism and reduced lifespan on exposure to soil leachates motivates further studies to explore the mechanism of the toxicity associated with the metals present in the environment.
1487	Nonylphenol (NP) and Cadmium (Cd) are two common contaminants that can be detected in aquatic environments.
1488	Nevertheless, the combined toxicity of NP and Cd at environmentally relevant concentrations in aquatic organisms has not been thoroughly characterized to date.
1489	In the present study, the interactions between NP and Cd on male Sebastiscus marmoratus were studied.
1490	After 21 days of exposure, the brain aromatase activity was observed to be significantly induced by 100 ng/L NP and 40 μg/L Cd, whereas all of the concentrations of co-treatment resulted in an increase in brain aromatase activity.
1491	Additionally, NP could also reduce plasma testosterone concentration, while NP, Cd and their mixture could induce plasma 17β-estradiol (E2) concentration and VTG concentration.
1492	The interactions between NP and Cd on the reproductive physiology were antagonism.
1493	Our results also support the notion of using these indicators as biomarkers for exposure to EDCs and further extend the boundary of biomonitoring to environmental levels.
1494	Hybrid III-V-on-silicon semiconductor optical amplifiers with high-gain and high-output-power are important in many applications such as transceivers, integrated microwave photonics and photonic beamforming.
1495	In this work we present the design, fabrication and characterization of high-gain, high-output-power III-V-on-silicon semiconductor optical amplifiers.
1496	The amplifiers support a hybrid III-V/Si optical mode to reduce confinement in the active region and increase the saturation power.
1497	A small-signal gain of 27 dB, a saturation power of 17.24 dBm and an on-chip output power of 17.5 dBm is measured for a current density of 4.9 kA/cm2 (power consumption of 540 mW) at room temperature for an amplifier with a total length of 1.45 mm.
1498	The amplifiers were realized using a 6 quantum well InGaAsP active region, which was previously used to fabricate high-speed directly modulated DFB lasers, enabling their co-integration.
1499	In addition to La-doped barium fluoride (BaF2) crystals, La/Ce co-doped BaF2 crystals were also investigated at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA.
1500	Strong cerium-induced emissions peaked at 305 and 320 nm with a decay time of 25 ns were observed, in addition to the fast and slow scintillation at 220 and 300 nm, respectively.
1501	The La/Ce co-doping was also found effective in suppressing the slow component in BaF2.
1502	Compared to La-doped crystals, the La/Ce co-doped crystals have a better light output in both 50- and 2500-ns gate.
1503	The fast/slow ratio of La/Ce co-doped crystal was found to be about 1/1, similar to La-doping, which is also considered not sufficient for pile-up suppression.
1504	A 20-cm-long La/Ce co-doped BaF2 crystal shows also excellent optical quality and light response uniformity.
1505	SIGNIFICANCE-Patients with pigment dispersion syndrome are frequently encountered in clinical practice.
1506	Iris abnormalities and the absence of key features of pigment dispersion syndrome can guide the discovery of secondary causes of pigmentary glaucoma, such as peripheral iris pigment epithelial cysts.
1507	PURPOSE-The purpose of this study was to describe a patient initially diagnosed as having primary pigmentary glaucoma found to have multiple bilateral peripheral iris pigment epithelial cysts causing pigment liberation, focal angle closure, and advanced secondary glaucoma.
1508	CASE REPORT-A 64-year-old man presented for follow-up after a recent diagnosis of primary pigmentary glaucoma in the left eye.
1509	Clinical examination revealed transillumination defects of both irides and a heavily pigmented trabecular meshwork.
1510	A midperipheral bulge of the iris was appreciated in the superior temporal quadrant of the left eye.
1511	Gonioscopic evaluation showed that the bulge focally obstructed the angle.
1512	Anterior segment optical coherence tomography demonstrated a normal iris insertion of both eyes, with the exception of a steepened approach superotemporally in the left eye.
1513	Ultrasound biomicroscopy revealed bilateral small- to medium-sized peripheral iris pigment epithelial cysts and confirmed a large cyst superotemporally in the left iris.
1514	CONCLUSIONS-This case describes a patient with advanced secondary pigmentary glaucoma from iris pigment epithelial cysts.
1515	The mechanisms of glaucoma are likely twofold: (1) pigment liberation from the cysts contacting the lens zonules and, to a lesser extent, (2) focal angle closure at the site of the large peripheral cyst.
1516	The key features of pigmentary glaucoma, namely, posterior bowing of the iris, may not be present in secondary pigment dispersion.
1517	This case highlights the importance of careful evaluation of the iris and angle in making a correct diagnosis.
1518	The choice of topical agent to control intraocular pressure while not increasing the size of these cysts is also an important consideration.
1519	Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is the consequence of an inherited autosomal dominant mutation which causes the early degeneration of intermediate cells of cochlear stria vascularis (SV) and profound hearing loss.
1520	Patients with WS may also experience primary vestibular symptoms.
1521	Most of the current WS studies did not discuss the relationship between WS and abnormal vestibular function.
1522	Our study found that a spontaneous mutant pig showed profound hearing loss and depigmentation.
1523	MITF-M, a common gene mutation causes type WS which affect the development of the intermediate cell of SV, was then identified for animal modeling.
1524	In this study, the degeneration of vestibular hair cells was found in pigs with MITF-M.
1525	The morphology of hair cells in vestibular organs of pigs was examined using electron microscopy from embryonic day E70 to postnatal two weeks.
1526	Significant hair cell loss in the mutant saccule was found in this study through E95 to P14.
1527	Conversely, there was no hair cell loss in either utricle or semi-circular canals.
1528	Our study suggested that MITF-M gene mutation only affects hair cells of the saccule, but has no effect on other vestibular organs.
1529	The study also indicated that the survival of cochlear and saccular hair cells was dependent on the potassium release from the cochlear SV, but hair cells of the utricle and semi-circular canals were independent on SV.
1530	While formaldehyde (HCHO) was likely generated in Earth's prebiotic atmosphere by ultraviolet light, electrical discharge, and/or volcano-created lightning, HCHO could not have accumulated in substantial amounts in prebiotic environments, including those needed for prebiotic processes that generate nucleosidic carbohydrates.
1531	HCHO at high concentrations in alkaline solutions self-reacts in the Cannizzaro reaction to give methanol and formate, neither having prebiotic value.
1532	Here, we explore the possibility that volcanic sulfur dioxide (SO2) might have generated a reservoir for Hadean HCHO by a reversible reaction with HCHO to give hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMS).
1533	We show that salts of HMS are stable as solids at 90°C and do not react with themselves in solution, even at high (>8 M) concentrations.
1534	This makes them effective stores of HCHO, since the reverse reaction slowly delivers HCHO back into an environment where it can participate in prebiotically useful reactions.
1535	Specifically, we show that in alkaline borate solutions, HCHO derived from HMS allows formation of borate-stabilized carbohydrates as effectively as free HCHO, without losing material to Cannizzaro products.
1536	Further, we show that SO2 can perform similar roles for glycolaldehyde and glyceraldehyde, two intrinsically unstable carbohydrates that are needed by various models as precursors for RNA building blocks.
1537	Zircons from the Hadean show that the Hadean mantle likely provided volcanic SO2 at rates at least as great as the rates of atmospheric HCHO generation, making the formation of Hadean HMS essentially unavoidable.
1538	Thus, hydroxymethylsulfonate adducts of formaldehyde, glycolaldehyde, and glyceraldehyde, including the less soluble barium, strontium, and calcium salts, are likely candidates for prebiotically useful organic minerals on early Earth.
1539	User-fee exemption for skilled delivery services has been implemented in Ghana since 2003 as a way to address financial barriers to access.
1540	However, many women still deliver at home.
1541	Based on data from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, we estimated the prevalence of home delivery and determined the factors contributing to homebirths among a total of 622 women in the Northern region in the context of the user-fee exemption policy in Ghana.
1542	Binary and multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed.
1543	Results suggest home delivery prevalence of 59% (365/622).
1544	Traditional birth attendants attended majority of home deliveries (93.4%).
1545	After adjusting for potential confounders, making less than four antenatal care visits (aOR = 2.42; CI = 1.91-6.45; p = 0.001), being a practitioner of traditional African religion (aOR = 16.40; CI = 3.10-25.40; p = 0.000), being a Muslim (aOR 2.10; CI = 1.46-5.30; p = 0.042), not having a health insurance (aOR = 1.85; CI = 1.773-4.72; p = 0.016), living in a male-headed household (aOR = 2.07; CI = 1.02-4.53; p < 0.01), and being unexposed to media (aOR = 3.10; CI = 1.12-5.38; p = 0.021) significantly predicted home delivery.
1546	Our results suggest that unless interventions are implemented to address other health system factors like insurance coverage, and socio-cultural and religious beliefs that hinder uptake of skilled care, the full benefits of user-fee exemption may not be realized in Ghana.
1547	The mechanism of how angiographic results following paclitaxel-coated balloon (PCB) treatment for small vessel disease affect patient outcome remains unknown.
1548	In the present study, we aimed to investigate the correlation between coronary dissection immediately after PCB angioplasty and midterm outcome.
1549	From March 2014 to March 2017, 171 consecutive patients with 228 native coronary artery lesions who received PCB angioplasty at a single center were enrolled retrospectively.
1550	Lesions with a reference vessel diameter > 2.8 mm were excluded.
1551	There were dissections in 80% of the lesions immediately following PCB angioplasty.
1552	Of these, 38% were type A, 29% were type B, and 13% were type C or more severe dissection.
1553	No patient required revascularization during hospitalization.
1554	We were able to follow 159 patients (212 lesions) clinically for > 6 months, from among whom target lesion revascularization (TLR) was performed in 7% of the patients.
1555	Follow-up angiography was performed on 143 lesions (67%), and complete healing of all dissections was noted.
1556	The rates of restenosis and late lumen enlargement were 12% and 56%, respectively.
1557	Multivariate analysis identified that a bending lesion was an independent predictor of TLR, and type C-E dissection and imaging device use were independent predictors of restenosis.
1558	Conversely, lesions with type B dissection had a larger net gain than lesions with type A or no dissection.
1559	Leaving the dissection uncovered after PCB angioplasty seems to be safe, resulting in a low acute event rate.
1560	The type B dissection after PCB angioplasty was the most therapeutic dissection.
1561	Attention controls the selective routing of visual inputs for classification.
1562	This "spotlight" of attention has been assumed to be a Gaussian, but here we propose that this routing occurs in the form of a shape.
1563	We show that a model of attention control that spatially averages saliency values over proto-objects (POs), fragments of feature-similar visual space, is better able to predict the fixation density maps and scanpaths made during the free viewing of 384 natural scenes by 12 participants than comparable saliency models that do not consider shape.
1564	We further show that this image-computable PO model is nearly as good in predicting fixations (density and scanpaths) as a model of fixation prediction that uses hand-segmented object labels.
1565	We interpret these results as suggesting that the spotlight of attention has a shape, and that these shapes can be quantified as regions of space that we refer to as POs.

1567	AIM-Recurrence being a major challenge for the treatment of cervical cancer, we aimed at identifying novel molecular markers of cervical cancer to improve recurrence prediction.
1568	METHODS-Cervical cancer samples were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas.
1569	Prognosis-associated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and mRNAs between recurrent and nonrecurrent samples were acquired using expression analysis.
1570	Regulatory relationships among these prognosis-associated RNAs were predicted and used to construct a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network.
1571	Key prognostic lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs were identified using the ceRNA network, followed by the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to reveal the influence of these key prognostic RNAs on prognosis.
1572	RESULTS-In total, 15 lncRNAs, 10 miRNAs, and 348 mRNAs were identified as significant prognosis-associated molecules.
1573	The cervical cancer-related ceRNA network contained 13 prognosis-associated lncRNAs, 5 prognosis-associated miRNAs, and 120 prognosis-associated mRNAs.
1574	Key prognostic lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs were further identified using the ceRNA network.
1575	The key prognostic lncRNAs included H19 and HOTAIR, those for miRNAs included hsa-miR-133b, hsa-miR-138, and hsa-miR-301b, and those for mRNAs included Wnt family member 2, fibroblast growth factor 7, fibronectin 1, synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A, and bone morphogenetic protein 7.
1576	CONCLUSION-The key prognostic lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs may serve as potential molecular markers for recurrence prediction and may contribute to the treatment of cervical cancer.
1577	BACKGROUND-The role of muscle fitness in controlling cardiometabolic risk factors during childhood is incompletely understood.
1578	METHODS-A prospective observational design including 6- to 11-year-old children (n = 512) was used to study associations between 1.5-year changes in handgrip strength, standing vertical jump displacement, the short shuttle run, and a composite of these with changes in composite and single cardiometabolic risk markers.
1579	The authors modeled sequential mixed linear regressions controlling for changes in cardiorespiratory fitness, waist circumference, and other putative confounding variables.
1580	RESULTS-Statistically significant associations, standardized beta (95% confidence intervals), were observed between changes in composite muscle fitness -0.19 (-0.30 to -0.07), muscular strength -0.15 (-0.25 to -0.06), and agility 0.14 (0.04 to 0.23), but not muscular power -0.06 (-0.14 to 0.03) with changes in the composite risk score.
1581	In sex-stratified analysis, associations were robust in girls, but not in boys.
1582	Control for changes in cardiorespiratory fitness and waist circumference greatly attenuated associations.
1583	Changes in muscle fitness were strongly associated with changes in waist circumference in both girls -0.21 (-0.37 to -0.05) and boys -0.23 (-0.35 to -0.11) after controlling for cardiorespiratory fitness.
1584	CONCLUSIONS-Our data support a unique role of muscle fitness in the promotion of metabolic health and prevention of excess adipose tissue accumulation in children.
1585	This note presents a solution of the swing-up task of two acrobots using trajectory optimization method.
1586	The equations of motion for 2-link and 3-link acrobot are manually derived, and then form the dynamics of the robots.
1587	Numerical integration method is used to simulate the behaviour of passive robots, with the goal of showing the correctness of the complicated dynamics of the 3-link acrobot.
1588	Direct collocation method is used to optimize the trajectory of state and control of the robots with bounds on both.
1589	We describe a type of supramolecular host-guest function silica nanoparticle activated by energy conversion from joint movement.
1590	The high coefficient of friction from damaged joints causes more energy conversion, weakening the surface host-guest interaction and resulting in target cargo release.
1591	Additionally, the hydrated layer on the nanoparticle surface plays a role in lubrication enhancement.
1592	A photoluminescence (PL) sensor based on core-shell quantum dots (QDs) coated with molecularly-imprinted polymer (MIP) shell was designed for the determination of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in water.
1593	PFOA is a persistent and bioaccumulating water contaminant whose detection is of great importance for ensuring safe water supplies.
1594	We demonstrate a simple method to fabricate CdTe@CdS QDs and then encapsulate them with a molecularly-imprinted silica film in a one-pot sol-gel reaction.
1595	The final composite was created by anchoring the MIP layer on the CdTe@CdS QDs using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) as functional monomer and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as crosslinker in the presence of aqueous ammonia.
1596	The combination of QDs and MIP showed stable photoluminescence and good selectivity.
1597	The PL of the MIP-coated QDs composite was efficiently quenched when PFOA molecules occupied the templated binding sites.
1598	The composite was applied to the detection of PFOA and exhibited a good linearity in range of 0.25-15.00 µmol/L with a detection limit of 25 nmol/L (~10 ppb by mass).
1599	The proposed method has been applied successfully for the determination of trace PFOA in environmental water samples and has demonstrated its robustness in the presence of other molecules and ions.
1600	Adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) are prone to depression, which can have detrimental effects including disease progression, poor treatment adherence and mortality.
1601	We aimed to determine the prevalence of depressive symptoms and their associated factors among ALHIV in Uganda.
1602	We conducted a cross-sectional survey among ALHIV (10-19 years) attending urban and rural clinics in Mbarara, Uganda between March and May 2017.
1603	Presence of depressive symptoms was assessed using the Centre for Epidemiological Studies' Depression scale.
1604	We interviewed 336 adolescents with a median age of 13 years, 62% of whom were female.
1605	A third (37%) had disclosed their HIV/AIDS status and 13% were sexually active.
1606	Overall, 154 (∼46%, [95% CI: 40.5-51.2]) had depressive symptoms.
1607	On bivariate analysis, the odds of having depressive symptoms were higher among adolescents who were ≥ 15 years, had disclosed HIV status, traveled >30 min for routine care and had risky sexual practices.
1608	On multiple variable analysis, only travel time to the clinic of >30 min was independently associated with depressive symptoms (AOR = 1.6 [95% CI: 1.02-2.7]).
1609	With the high prevalence of depressive symptoms among ALHIV in Uganda, screening and prompt treatment of depression should be incorporated within their routine care.
1610	Samples from moribund lumpfish were collected in a marine hatchery in Scotland in 2015.
1611	Black nodules were noted on the skin, and gills and fungal hyphae were extensively distributed in musculature and internal organs.
1612	Multifocal chronic inflammatory lesions displaced structures in all affected organs.
1613	Mortalities commenced on completion of spawning in May and were evenly distributed over the second year in the temperature range 11-15°C.
1614	The main systemic infection causing agent was initially identified based on morphological characteristics as an Exophiala species.
1615	Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) ITS regions of the isolates were subsequently sequenced confirming the isolates belonged to Exophiala genus.
1616	All isolates fell in a single phylogenetic cluster, which is represented by Exophiala angulospora.
1617	Fish were treated with either formalin or Bronopol or a combination of both, but there was no effect on the pattern or numbers of mortalities.
1618	Isolates were also tested against three different concentrations of Latrunculin A, Amphotericin B and Itraconazole with no success.
1619	It is of utmost importance to increase the knowledge on pathogen-host interactions to successfully develop sustainable control methods.
1620	BACKGROUND-This study assessed subcutaneous absorption kinetics of rapid-acting insulin administered as a bolus using bolus delivery speeds commonly employed in commercially available insulin pumps (i.e., 2 and 40 s for delivering 1 insulin unit).
1621	MATERIALS AND METHODS-Twenty C-peptide-negative type 1 diabetic subjects were studied on two occasions, separated by at least 7 days, using the euglycemic clamp procedure.
1622	After an overnight fast, subjects were given, in random order, a subcutaneous insulin bolus (15 U of insulin lispro, Eli Lilly) either for 30 s using an Animas IR2020 pump (fast bolus delivery) or for 10 min using a Medtronic Minimed Paradigm 512 pump (slow bolus delivery).
1623	RESULTS-Fast bolus delivery resulted in an earlier onset of insulin action as compared with slow bolus delivery (21.0 ± 2.5 vs. 34.3 ± 2.7 min; P < 0.002).
1624	Furthermore, time to reach maximum insulin effect was found to be 27 min earlier with fast bolus delivery as compared with slow bolus delivery (98 ± 11 vs. 125 ± 16 min; P < 0.005).
1625	In addition, the area under the plasma insulin curve from 0 to 60 min for fast bolus delivery was greater than the one for slow bolus delivery (10,307 ± 1291 vs. 8192 ± 865 min·pmol/L; P = 0.027).
1626	CONCLUSIONS-Results suggest that insulin bolus delivery with fast delivery speed may result in more rapid insulin absorption and, thus, may provide a better control of meal-related glucose excursions than that obtained with bolus delivery using slow delivery speeds.
1627	Our findings may have important implications for the future design of the bolus delivery unit of insulin pumps.
1628	When adding or subtracting quantities, adults tend to overestimate addition outcomes and underestimate subtraction outcomes.
1629	They also shift visuospatial attention to the right when adding and to the left when subtracting.
1630	These operational momentum phenomena are thought to reflect an underlying representation in which small magnitudes are associated with the left side of space and large magnitudes with the right side of space.
1631	Currently, there is limited research on operational momentum in early childhood or for operations other than addition and subtraction.
1632	The current study tested whether English-speaking 3- and 4-year-old children and college-aged adults exhibit operational momentum when ordering quantities.
1633	Participants were presented with two experimental blocks.
1634	In one block of trials, they were tasked with choosing the same quantity they had previously seen three times; in the other block, they were asked to generate the next quantity in a doubling sequence composed of three ascending quantities.
1635	A bias to shift attention to the right after an ascending operation was found in both age groups, and a bias to overestimate the next sequential quantity during an ascending ordering operation was found in adults under conditions of uncertainty.
1636	These data suggest that, for children, the spatial biases during operating are more pronounced than the mis-estimation biases.
1637	These findings highlight the spatial underpinnings of operational momentum and suggest that both very young children and adults conceptualize quantity along a horizontal continuum during ordering operations, even before formal schooling.
1638	Expression of the epidermal growth factor ligands amphiregulin (AREG) and epiregulin (EREG) is positively correlated with a response to EGFR-targeted therapies in colorectal cancer.
1639	Gene-body methylation sites, which show a strong inverse correlation with AREG and EREG gene expression, were identified in cell lines using targeted 454 FLX-bisulfite sequencing and SIRPH analyses for AREG/EREG promoters and intragenic CpGs.
1640	Upon treatment of colorectal cancer cells with 5-aza-2'-desoxycytidine, methylation decreases at specific intragenic CpGs accompanied by upregulation of AREG and EREG gene expression.
1641	The same AREG gene-body methylation was also found in human colorectal cancer samples and is independent of KRAS and NRAS mutations.
1642	Methylation is specifically decreased in the tumor epithelial compartment as compared to stromal tissue and normal epithelium.
1643	Investigation of a promoter/enhancer function of the AREG exon 2 region revealed a potential promoter function in reverse orientation.
1644	Retrospective comparison of the predictive power of AREG gene-body methylation versus AREG gene expression using samples from colorectal cancer patients treated with anti-EGFR inhibitors with complete clinical follow-up revealed that AREG expression is superior to AREG gene methylation.
1645	AREG and EREG genes undergo a complex regulation involving both intragenic methylation and promoter-dependent control.
1646	Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is of serious public health concern due to its extensive antibiotic resistance and association with frequent outbreaks.
1647	So far, MRSA has received very little attention in Ghana.
1648	In line with recent efforts by the Government of Ghana to improve surveillance of antibiotic resistance, this article reviews the existing literature on MRSA in Ghana with the aim of highlighting its public health significance, identifying relevant areas of research, and how to combat this pathogen.
1649	There is a low prevalence of MRSA in Ghana.
1650	However, the presence of several epidemic multidrug-resistant clones of MRSA detected in the country poses a potentially serious public health threat.
1651	In Ghana, MRSA appears to have evolved from a relatively less-recognized pathogen to an important one, which is partly because of outbreaks of the organism in the last few years.
1652	Generally, little is known about the epidemiology of MRSA in Ghana and effective surveillance of the pathogen is required to deal with its emerging public health threat in the country.
1653	OBJECTIVES-Pediatric Chiari Type 1 Malformations (CM1) are commonly referred for neurosurgical opinion.
1654	The ideal management in children regarding surgical and radiographic decision making is not clearly delineated.
1655	PATIENTS AND METHODS-We retrospectively reviewed our cohort of patients age 18 years and younger referred to a single neurosurgeon for CM1.
1656	Baseline MRIs of the spine were obtained.
1657	Non-operative patients had repeat imaging at 6-12 months.
1658	Patients who underwent an operation (decompression with/without duraplasty) had repeat imaging at 6 months.
1659	RESULTS-One hundred and thirty-two patients with mean age of 10 years met inclusion criteria.
1660	All patients had post-operative symptomatic improvement.
1661	We identified 26 patients with syrinx, 8 with scoliosis, 3 with hydrocephalus, and one had tethered cord.
1662	The average tonsillar descent was 8.1 mm in the non-operative group and 11.9 mm in the operative group.
1663	Ninety-five patients were managed conservatively (72%).
1664	Thirty-seven were offered surgery (28%), and 33 patients underwent intervention; 21 with duraplasty (64%) and 12 without (36%).
1665	CONCLUSIONS-Pediatric patients with CM1 require both clinical and radiographic follow-up.
1666	Duraplasty may be performed if decompression fails to relieve symptomatology, but is not always needed.
1667	CM1 continues to present a challenge in surgical decision making.
1668	Adhering to a treatment paradigm may help alleviate difficult decision-making.
1669	BACKGROUND-Huánuco is a central eastern region of Peru in whose geography we can find both high forest and low jungle, as well as the mountain range that constitutes the inter-Andean valleys.
1670	It is considered an endemic Dengue region due to the many favorable conditions that facilitate the transmission of the virus.
1671	METHODOLOGY-A total of 268 serum samples from patients with acute febrile illness (AFI) were assessed for the presence of Dengue virus (DENV) via RT-PCR, Elisa NS1, IgM and IgG during December 2015 and March 2016 in Huánuco, Peru.
1672	RESULTS-Dengue virus was detected in 25% of samples via RT-PCR, followed by 19% Elisa NS1 antigen and 10.5% through Elisa IgM.
1673	The Elisa IgG was detected in 15.7% of samples.
1674	The most frequent symptoms associated with fever were headaches, myalgias, and arthralgias across all groups, with no significant difference between the four testing methods CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we identified DENV in up to 25% of the samples using the standard laboratory method; in addition, a correlation was established between the frequency of positive results and the serological tests that determine NS1, IgM and IgG.
1675	There is an increasing need of point-of-care tests to strengthen Peruvian epidemiological surveillance.
1676	BACKGROUND-Acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) is a potentially devastating condition that can lead to death or life-long neurodevelopmental handicaps.
1677	ABE is particularly tragic because it is, in theory, completely preventable.
1678	Progress toward its prevention has been hampered by the perception that the extreme hyperbilirubinemia giving rise to ABE typically has no clear causation, with the majority of previous cases being labeled as "idiopathic" neonatal jaundice.
1679	OBJECTIVES-This research briefing is intended to inform readers of a new prospective study aimed at clarifying the causes of ABE.
1680	This is accomplished by identifying qualifying patients with ABE anywhere in the USA and then documenting their clinical characteristics and the results of testing 28 specific genetic associations in a web-based, institutional review board-approved, REDCap (research electronic data capture) deidentified registry.
1681	METHODS-In this research briefing, we present an overview of ABE and discuss the problem that most patients in the past have been labeled as having "idiopathic" hyperbilirubinemia.
1682	We also present data supporting a new theory that most (perhaps all) ABE patients have mutations or polymorphisms in genes involved in bilirubin production or metabolism.
1683	We introduce a new registry seeking to enroll 100 neonates with ABE as a voluntary, deidentified database, with next generation sequencing of 28 genes involved in bilirubin production/metabolism provided to enrollees at no cost.
1684	RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS-The Neonatal Acute Bilirubin Encephalopathy Registry (NABER) study will correlate deidentified clinical and genetic data in order to clarify the underlying causes of hyperbilirubinemia in current ABE patients.
1685	We maintain that the improved understanding this study produces will constitute a needed step toward devising new clinical pathways and strategies for preventing ABE in neonates.
1686	This study quantified the biomechanical (movements and forces) and physiological (energy expenditure) demands of postal delivery performed with electrically assisted bicycles (EABs).
1687	Ten postal workers and 10 recreational athletes performed three simulated postal tasks (simulated mail delivery circuit, delivery distance [close vs. far], and 3-min stationary cycling) while carrying 0, 16 and 32 kg.
1688	Physiological (energy expenditure) and biomechanical (internal and external forces and joint angles) responses were calculated.
1689	Energy expenditure (10-20%; p < 0.05) and power output (30-44%; p < 0.05) increased with increasing mail loads.
1690	Ground reaction force increased (∼10%) for the far delivery distance, but joint reaction forces were unchanged.
1691	Lower hip flexion (p < 0.01), less hip abduction (p < 0.01) and larger spine anterior flexion (p < 0.01) were observed for the far delivery distance.
1692	Joint forces were not affected by the mail load transported (0-32 kg) or distance from the mailbox (close vs far).
1693	EABs can provide a suitable transportation method to assist mail delivery in terms of energy expenditure reduction.
1694	BACKGROUND-Increasingly, evidence from brain imaging supports the role of neuroinflammation in dementia progression.
1695	Yet, it is not clear if there are patterns of spatial and temporal susceptibility to neuroinflammatory processes in the brain that may correspond to dementia staging or symptom expression.
1696	METHODS-We searched literature databases for case-control studies examining levels of translocator protein (TSPO) levels using positron emission tomography, representing neuroinflammation, in regional analyses between healthy controls and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects.
1697	Standardised mean differences (SMDs) were calculated and results meta-analysed using random-effects models.
1698	Quality assessments, sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis and meta-regressions were also performed.
1699	RESULTS-Twenty-eight studies comprising 755 (HC = 318, MCI = 168, AD = 269) participants and 37 brain regions were included.
1700	Compared to HCs, AD participants had increased TSPO levels throughout the brain (SMD range: 0.43-1.76), especially within fronto-temporal regions.
1701	MCI subjects also had increased TSPO levels, mainly within the neocortex, with more modest effects (SMD range: 0.46 - 0.90).
1702	Meta-regression analysis identified an inverse association between TSPO levels in the parietal region and Mini-Mental State Examination scores, a proxy for disease severity, in AD subjects (estimate: -0.11, 95% confidence interval: -0.21 to -0.02; P = 0.024).
1703	CONCLUSIONS-Our findings support the association of increased neuroinflammation during the progression of MCI and AD, relative to HCs.
1704	This study examined the impact of bombing on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and psychiatric co-morbidity over time, whether this relationship was mediated by shattered world assumptions and altered self-capacities, and whether the mediational effects were moderated by attachment style and crisis support among Iraqi civilians.
1705	One hundred and fifty-nine Iraqi civilians completed questionnaires measuring the aforementioned psychological constructs.
1706	Bombing exposure was associated with PTSD and psychiatric co-morbidity over time; 87% and 77% met the criteria for PTSD at baseline and five months respectively.
1707	Shattered world assumptions and altered self-capacities mediated the impact of bombing exposure on PTSD and psychiatric co-morbidity over time.
1708	The mediational effect for shattered world assumptions was not moderated by attachment style and crisis support.
1709	However, the mediational effect for altered self-capacities was moderated by fearful attachment and a medium level of crisis support.
1710	To conclude, following bombing, Iraqi civilians' assumptions about the world and others can change.
1711	These changes can have long term effects on psychological distress but are not influenced by childhood attachment experiences or the amount of crisis support received.
1712	Bombing can also change civilians' perceptions of internal capacities like emotional regulation, particularly those with fearful attachment who rely on crisis support to some extent.
1713	We have previously demonstrated that kindling of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) induced psychosis relevant behaviors only after one, but not after five, stage-5 seizures, suggesting that five stage-5 NAc-evoked seizures antagonized psychosis relevant behaviors in rats.
1714	We hypothesized that brain opioid receptors are responsible for seizure-induced reduction of psychosis relevant behaviors in NAc kindled rats.
1715	Rats received NAc kindling until a stage-4 seizure was induced, after which naloxone, a non-specific opioid receptor antagonist, at dose of 1 or 10 mg/kg i.p., or saline (0.3 mL) i.p., was injected 15 min before each kindled seizure.
1716	Duration of afterdischarge (AD) was not significantly different among naloxone- and saline-treated groups.
1717	However, duration of postictal behavioral depression induced by a stage-5 seizure was significantly shorter in 10 mg/kg naloxone-treated than saline-treated rats, for long (>36 s) AD duration.
1718	When tested 3-4 days after five stage-5 seizures, 10 mg/kg naloxone-treated rats, as compared to saline-treated rats, showed a statistically significant loss of gating of hippocampal auditory evoked potentials, and significant reduction of startle response amplitude, but non-significant differences in prepulse inhibition and methamphetamine-induced locomotion.
1719	It is inferred that stage-5 seizures, by releasing endogenous opiates, contribute to postictal behavioral depression, and some long-term seizure-induced antipsychotic effects.
1720	In this study, a health risk assessment of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in drinking water and food was conducted using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in major cities of China.
1721	Considering the numerous non-detected values found in drinking water samples, a zero-inflated model was employed to obtain a more precise NDMA concentration distribution function in drinking water.
1722	With exogenous chronic daily intake of 1.20 × 10-6 mg/(kg*d), the lifetime cancer risk and disability-adjusted life years of NDMA are 4.01 × 10-5 and 5.52 × 10-6 per person-year (ppy).
1723	The disease burden attributable to water sources accounts for nearly 9.94% of total exogenous intake.
1724	The contribution rate of vegetables is the largest, followed by cereals, milk products, fish and shrimp, and meat.
1725	Taking endogenous sources into consideration, the contribution rates of drinking water and food sources decrease to 0.08% and 0.69%.
1726	This study provides a scientific basis for making policy decisions on NDMA pollution management.
1727	Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder with few reported cases in the United States.
1728	Magnetic resonance imaging findings in the brain include hypomyelination and low generalized parenchymal volume.
1729	Presented here is a case in a 3-month-old male who presented with hypotonia and seizures and was subsequently diagnosed with adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency.
1730	Given the rarity of this diagnosis, findings demonstrated in this case may prompt ordering physicians to broaden their approach to genetic testing in the setting of hypomyelination.
1731	Comparison is also made to more common hypomyelinating leukodystrophies.
1732	Patients with esophageal carcinoma (ESCA) have a poor prognosis and high mortality rate.
1733	Although standard therapies have had effect, there is an urgent requirement to develop novel options, as increasing drug tolerance has been identified in clinical practice.
1734	In the present study, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of ESCA were identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype‑Tissue Expression databases.
1735	Functional and protein‑protein interaction (PPI) analyses were performed.
1736	The Connectivity Map (CMAP) was selected to predict drugs for the treatment of ESCA, and their target genes were acquired from the Search Tool for Interactions of Chemicals (STITCH) by uploading the Simplified Molecular‑Input Line‑Entry System structure.
1737	Additionally, significant target genes and ESCA‑associated hub genes were extracted using another PPI analysis, and the corresponding drugs were added to construct a network.
1738	Furthermore, the binding affinity between predicted drug candidates and ESCA‑associated hub genes was calculated using molecular docking.
1739	Finally, 827 DEGs (|log2 fold‑change|≥2; q‑value <0.05), which are principally involved in protein digestion and absorption (P<0.005), the plasminogen‑activating cascade (P<0.01), as well as the 'biological regulation' of the Biological Process, 'membrane' of the Cellular Component and 'protein binding' of the Molecular Function categories, were obtained.
1740	Additionally, 11 hub genes were obtained from the PPI network (all degrees ≥30).
1741	Furthermore, the 15 first screen drugs were extracted from CMAP (score <‑0.85) and the 9 second screen drugs with 70 target genes were extracted from STITCH.
1742	Furthermore, another PPI analysis extracted 51 genes, and apigenin, baclofen, Prestwick‑685, menadione, butyl hydroxybenzoate, gliclazide and valproate were selected as drug candidates for ESCA.
1743	Those molecular docking results with a docking score of >5.52 indicated the significance of apigenin, Prestwick‑685 and menadione.
1744	The results of the present study may lead to novel drug candidates for ESCA, among which Prestwick‑685 and menadione were identified to be significant new drug candidates.
1745	All nurses have the potential and responsibility to effect positive change in nursing practice and healthcare.
1746	This article details the characteristics of leaders and effective followers and clarifies that one does not need to be in a management position to function as a leader.
1747	BACKGROUND-Development of autologous and recombinant growth factor/matrix combination products represent a new emerging trend in regenerative therapeutics and have gained increasing attention as a strategy to optimize tissue regeneration.
1748	The aim of the present study was to evaluate the levels of Platelet derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) during early healing period after the regenerative treatment of intrabony defects using beta tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) as a bone regeneration material with either platelet rich fibrin (PRF) membrane or collagen membrane (CM) treated with recombinant human PDGF-BB (rhPDGF-BB).
1749	METHODS-Twenty patients (13 males and 7 females) with chronic periodontitis participated in this prospective, randomized clinical and biochemical study.
1750	Each patient was randomly assigned to PRF membrane (group A) or CM incorporated with rhPDGF-BB (group B).
1751	GCF samples were obtained on days 3, 7, 14 and 30 for evaluation of PDGF-BB levels and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels.
1752	RESULTS-On days 3 and 7 following surgery, mean levels of PDGF-BB at sites treated with PRF membrane or CM incorporated with rhPDGF-BB as a barrier membrane were not significantly different.
1753	PDGF-BB levels decreased significantly in samples collected on days 14 and 30 with significant differences between both the groups.
1754	ALP levels significantly increased from day 3 to day 30 but there was no difference between two groups.
1755	CONCLUSION-Within the limitations of the study, both PRF membrane and CM incorporated with rhPDGF-BB showed comparable GCF levels of PDGF-BB initially with PRF showing more sustained levels throughout the study period.

1758	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are expressed aberrantly in various types of cancer, and negatively regulate the expression of target genes which may be useful in therapeutic strategies in several biological processes.
1759	In the present study, the expression levels and the effects of miRNA (miR)‑421 in breast cancer tissues and MCF‑7 and MDA‑MB‑231 cells were evaluated to elucidate therapeutic targets in breast cancer cells.
1760	The putative targets of miR‑421 were predicted by bioinformatics approaches, and the expression levels of miR‑421 were measured in MCF‑7 and MDA‑MB‑231 cells by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis following miR‑421 knockdown.
1761	The rates of cell proliferation, migration capacity, invasiveness and apoptosis were determined in miR‑421 inhibitor‑transfected MCF‑7 and MDA‑MB‑231 cells.
1762	The expression levels of target proteins regulated by miR‑421 in MCF‑7 and MDA‑MB‑231 cells were analyzed by western blot analysis.
1763	miR‑421 was increased significantly in breast cancer tissues and cells, and was regulated by miR‑421 antisense oligonucleotides.
1764	The knockdown of miR‑421 in MCF‑7 and MDA‑MB‑231 cells decreased cell proliferation, migration capacity and invasiveness, and promoted apoptosis compared with control groups.
1765	The expression of target protein programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) were decreased in MCF‑7 and MDA‑MB‑231 cells transfected with miR‑421 inhibitors.
1766	These results suggested a correlation between miR‑421 and PDCD4, and physiological functions of breast cancer cells, suggesting that miR‑421 may be a potential strategy in the therapy of breast cancer.
1767	OBJECTIVES-Trabecular bone adapts to the strains placed upon the skeleton during life.
1768	Anthropological research has largely focused on linking variation in primate trabecular bone to locomotor mode, to provide a context for interpreting fossil morphology.
1769	However, intraspecific variation and its underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood.
1770	Trabecular bone is influenced by a variety of factors including body mass, age, diet, temperature, genetics, sex, and behavior.
1771	Before trabecular structure can be used to infer habitual behavior in the past, the effects of these factors need to be understood.
1772	In this article, we examine variation in trabecular structure in the human foot in four archaeological groups in relation to inferred levels of terrestrial mobility and sex.
1773	MATERIALS AND METHODS-We use high-resolution μCT scanning to examine variation in trabecular structure in the human calcaneus, talus, and first metatarsal in two relatively mobile and two relatively sedentary archaeological groups.
1774	RESULTS-The four population samples show similar patterns of trabecular variation throughout the foot, influenced by mechanical loading.
1775	Greater inferred terrestrial mobility is associated with greater bone volume fraction and thicker, more widely spaced, and less interconnected trabeculae.
1776	However, contrary to diaphyseal rigidity, only limited sexual dimorphism was found in trabecular structure.
1777	DISCUSSION-This work demonstrates that trabecular bone may serve as a useful proxy of habitual behavior in the fossil and archaeological record when other factors are carefully considered.
1778	However, the mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphism are not well understood.
1779	As such, inferring sex differences in habitual behavior is currently challenging.
1780	THE POCO IS A NEW KIT THAT LETS OWNERS SNAP TOGETHER A PROGRAMMABLE HANDHELD video-game player.
1781	But it started life in 2009 as something completely different.
1782	The original concept was to make the first HD camcorder with a 14-megapixel photo capability, with a footprint about the size of a credit card.
1783	• The inspiration for this was the Flip Video camera, which was introduced in 2007 and sold in the millions as a cheap and easy way to capture digital video.
1784	My goal was to improve the design using new mobile-phone technology to produce a similarly easy-to-use product, but one packed into a much smaller case.
1785	• What happened next is a story about the need for adaptation in the face of changing circumstances.
1786	Fortunately, myfamily has some experience in handling what happens when concept meets reality: My father, Iain Sinclair, is an industrial designer who styled over 100 gaming systems for Saitek, and my uncle is Sir Clive Sinclair, who created the popular Sinclair line of home computers in the 1980s.
1787	• To create my camcorder, I first sourced an ultrathin 2.4-inch AMOLED (active-matrix OLED) display from CMEL that seemed brighter and clearer than anything I'd seen before or since.
1788	A suitable camera SOC (system-on-chip) came from Ambarella.
1789	I also learned about a camera module from a German company that could handle HD video even in low light, and capture 14-megapixel still images.
1790	Test results for the combination of the SOC and camera-module sensor were comparable to those produced by a much larger Sony camcorder.
1791	• I added other technology such as postage-stamp-size supercapacitors from Murata to power an LED flash.
1792	To keep the credit card footprint, I chose a magnesium body with ultrathin walls (expensive but otherwise impossible to achieve using the cheaper alternative of injection-molded plastic).
1793	BACKGROUND-Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury is the most common and serious complication after thyroid surgery.
1794	However, little is known about the temperature threshold leading to RLN injury.
1795	In this study, we investigated threshold temperatures that cause RLN injury during thyroid surgery using continuous intraoperative neuromonitoring in swine models.
1796	METHODS-Four pigs weighing 30 to 40 kg were used for this study.
1797	We applied automatic periodic stimulation to the vagus nerve and dissected the RLN.
1798	The operative field was then filled with water at various temperatures (1.9°C to 87.4°C).
1799	The threshold temperature was defined as the temperature measured before filling the operative field that was associated with adverse events (latency increase of more than 10% or amplitude decrease of more than 50%).
1800	Loss of signal was defined as the electromyography (EMG) signal disappearing and not recovering during 30 min of observation.
1801	RESULTS-The low and high threshold temperatures were 2.5°C and 81.5°C, respectively.
1802	There were no adverse events at surrounding temperatures between 5.9°C and 77.5°C.
1803	The EMG signals in the RLNs exposed to the low threshold temperatures recovered, and there was no loss of signal.
1804	In contrast, the RLNs that showed adverse events at the high threshold temperatures showed loss of signal and no recovery of EMG signals.
1805	CONCLUSIONS-The RLN was found to be resistant to cold injury, whereas surrounding temperatures above 81.5°C may cause permanent thermal injury to the RLN.
1806	The surrounding temperature should be controlled within the safe range during thyroid surgery to avoid RLN injury.
1807	Land plants evolved about 470 million years ago or even earlier, in a biological crust-dominated terrestrial flora.
1808	The origin of land plants was probably one of the most significant events in Earth's history, which ultimately contributed to the greening of the terrestrial environment and opened up the way for the diversification of both plant and non-plant lineages.
1809	Fossil and phylogenetic evidence suggest that land plants have evolved from fresh-water charophycean algae, which were physiologically, genetically, and developmentally potentiated to make the transition to land.
1810	Since all land plants have biphasic life cycles, in contrast to the haplontic life cycle of Charophytes, the evolution of land plants was linked to the origin of a multicellular sporophytic phase.
1811	Land plants have evolved complex body plans in a way that overall complexity increased toward the tip of the land plant tree of life.
1812	Early forms were unbranched, with terminal sporangia and simple rhizoid rooting structures but without vasculature and leaves.
1813	Later on, branched forms with lateral sporangia appeared and paved the route for the evolution for indeterminacy.
1814	Finally, leaves and roots evolved to enable efficient nutrient transport to support a large plant body.
1815	The fossil record also suggests that almost all plant organs, such as leaves and roots, evolved multiple times independently over the course of land plant evolution.
1816	In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the evolution of the land plant body plan by combining evidence of the fossil record, phylogenetics, and developmental biology.
1817	Waterborne diseases have significant public health and socioeconomic implications worldwide.
1818	Many viral pathogens are commonly associated with water-related diseases, namely enteric viruses.
1819	Also, novel recently discovered human-associated viruses have been shown to be a causative agent of gastroenteritis or other clinical symptoms.
1820	A wide range of analytical methods is available for virus detection in environmental water samples.
1821	Viral isolation is historically carried out via propagation on permissive cell lines; however, some enteric viruses are difficult or not able to propagate on existing cell lines.
1822	Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) screening of viral nucleic acid is routinely used to investigate virus contamination in water due to the high sensitivity and specificity.
1823	Additionally, the introduction of metagenomic approaches into environmental virology has facilitated the discovery of viruses that cannot be grown in cell culture.
1824	This review (i) highlights the applications of molecular techniques in environmental virology such as PCR and its modifications to overcome the critical issues associated with the inability to discriminate between infectious viruses and nonviable, (ii) outlines the strengths and weaknesses of Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification (NASBA) and microarray, (iii) discusses the role of digital PCR as an emerging water quality monitoring assay and its advantages over qPCR, (iv) addresses the viral metagenomics in terms of detecting emerging viral pathogens and diversity in aquatic environment.
1825	Indeed, there are many challenges for selecting methods to detect classic and emerging viruses in environmental samples.
1826	While the existing techniques have revealed the importance and diversity of viruses in the water environment, further developments are necessary to enable more rapid and accurate methodologies for viral water quality monitoring and regulation.
1827	OBJECTIVES-Chronic Q fever is a persistent infection, mostly of aortic aneurysms, vascular prostheses or damaged heart valves caused by the intracellular bacterium Coxiella burnetii.
1828	Only a fraction of C. burnetii-infected individuals at risk develops chronic Q fever.
1829	In these individuals, a defective innate immune response may contribute to the development of chronic Q fever.
1830	We assessed whether genetic variations in genes involved in the killing machinery for C. burnetii by macrophages, contribute to the progression to chronic Q fever.
1831	METHODS-The prevalence of 66 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 31 genes pivotal in phagolysosomal maturation, bacterial killing and autophagy, was determined in 173 chronic Q fever patients and 184 controls with risk-factors for chronic Q fever and serological evidence of a C. burnetii infection.
1832	Associations were detected with univariate logistic regression models.
1833	To assess the effect of these SNPs on innate responses to C. burnetii, C. burnetii-induced cytokine production and basal ROS production of healthy volunteers was determined.
1834	RESULTS-RAB7A (rs13081864) and P2RX7 loss-of-function SNP (rs3751143) were more common in chronic Q fever patients than in controls.
1835	RAB5A (rs8682), P2RX7 gain-of-function SNP (rs1718119), MAP1LC3A (rs1040747) and ATG5 (rs2245214) were more common in controls.
1836	In healthy volunteers, RAB7A (rs13081864) and MAP1LC3A (rs1040747) influenced the C. burnetii-induced cytokine production.
1837	RAB7A (rs13081864) modulated basal ROS production.
1838	CONCLUSIONS-RAB7A (rs13081864) and P2RX7 (rs3751143) are associated with the development of chronic Q fever, whereas RAB5A (rs8682), P2RX7 (rs1718119), MAP1LC3A (rs1040747) and ATG5 (rs2245214) may have protective effects.
1839	Purpose-Monitoring Crohn's disease (CD) activity has a crucial importance, especially for evaluating treatment efficacy.
1840	Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) or their combination may represent potential non-invasive tools for this purpose.
1841	This study aimed to examine DWI and MRE for their potential to differentiate between different grades of ileocolonic CD activity.
1842	Materials and Methods-This retrospective study included 54 adult patients with a diagnosis of CD who underwent ileocolonoscopy and MRE including the DWI sequence.
1843	The severity of CD inflammation was categorized by Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) as inactive, mild, moderate and severe.
1844	In addition, following conventional MRE and DWI parameters were examined: bowel wall thickness, mural T2 hyperintensity, contrast enhancement, DWI signal intensity, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values.
1845	Results-In patients with moderate to severe disease based on SES-CD, T2 hyperintensity score [1.68 ± 0.77 (1-3) vs. 2.19 ± 0.69 (1-3); p = 0.013] and mean DWI score [2.42 ± 0.58 (1-3) vs. 2.04 ± 0.69 (1-3); p = 0.037 ] were higher and mean ADC values [1.5 ± 0.4 (0.9-2.5) vs. 1.2 ± 0.3 (0.6-1.8)] were lower compared to patients with inactive to mild CD.
1846	ADC had a moderate diagnostic accuracy in predicting moderate to severe disease (AUC = 0.729, 95% CI = 0.591-0.841, p = 0.001), with a cut-off value of ≤1.47 × 10-3 mm2/sec yielded 88.5% (23/26) sensitivity, 57.1% (16/28) specificity.
1847	Conclusion-DWI, ADC and T2 signal appear to differentiate moderate to severe CD from inactive to mildly active CD, based on SES-CD evaluation and may be useful in monitoring disease activity, particularly when evaluating treatment response.
1848	Cross-camera label estimation from a set of unlabelled training data is an extremely important component in unsupervised person re-identification (re-ID) systems.
1849	With the estimated labels, existing advanced supervised learning methods can be leveraged to learn discriminative re-ID models.
1850	In this paper, we utilize the graph matching technique for accurate label estimation due to its advantages in optimal global matching and intra-camera relationship mining.
1851	However, the graph structure constructed with non-learnt similarity measurement cannot handle the large cross-camera variations, which leads to noisy and inaccurate label outputs.
1852	This paper designs a Dynamic Graph Matching (DGM) framework, which improves the label estimation process by iteratively refining the graph structure with better similarity measurement learnt from intermediate estimated labels.
1853	In addition, we design a positive re-weighting strategy to refine the intermediate labels, which enhances the robustness against inaccurate matching output and noisy initial training data.
1854	To fully utilize the abundant video information and reduce false matchings, a co-matching strategy is further incorporated into the framework.
1855	Comprehensive experiments conducted on three video benchmarks demonstrate that DGM outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised re-ID methods and yields competitive performance to fully supervised upper bounds.
1856	OBJECTIVES-To study if androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), the mainstay treatment for advanced and disseminated prostate cancer, is associated with risk of dementia.
1857	METHODS-Risk of dementia in men with prostate cancer primarily managed with ADT or watchful waiting (WW) in Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden (PCBaSe) was compared with that of prostate cancer-free men, matched on birth year and county of residency.
1858	We used Cox's regression to calculate hazard ratios for Alzheimer's and non-Alzheimer's dementia (vascular dementia, dementia secondary to other diseases or unspecified dementias) for different types and duration of ADT and oral antiandrogens as well as for men managed with watchful waiting.
1859	RESULTS-25 967 men with prostate cancer and 121 018 prostate cancer-free men were followed for a median time of four years, and in both groups 6% of the men were diagnosed with dementia.
1860	Use of Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH agonists, Hazard Ratio (HR): 1.15 (95%CI: 1.07-1.23) and orchiectomy, HR 1.60 (95%CI: 1.32-1.93) were associated with an increased risk of dementia, as compared to prostate cancer-free men.
1861	However, this increase in risk was only observed for non-Alzheimer's dementia and occurred from year one to four after start of ADT.
1862	No increase in for any type of dementia was observed for men treated with antiandrogens or for men on WW.
1863	CONCLUSION-This population-based cohort study does not support previous observations of an increased risk of Alzheimer's dementia for men on ADT.
1864	However, there was a small increase in risk of non-Alzheimer's dementia.

1867	Public security and law enforcement have a crucial but often largely unacknowledged role in protecting and promoting public health.
1868	Although the security sector is a key partner in many specific public health programmes, its identity as an important part of the public health endeavour is rarely recognised.
1869	This absence of recognition has resulted in a generally inadequate approach to research and investigation of ways in which law enforcement, especially police at both operational and strategic levels, can be effectively engaged to actively promote and protect public health as part of a broader multisectoral public health effort.
1870	However, the challenge remains to engage police to consider their role as one that serves a public health function.
1871	The challenge consists of overcoming the continuous and competitive demand for police to do so-called policing, rather than serve a broader public health function-often derogatively referred to as social work.
1872	This Series paper explores the intersect between law enforcement and public health at the global and local levels and argues that public health is an integral aspect of public safety and security.
1873	Recognition of this role of public health is the first step towards encouraging a joined-up approach to dealing with entrenched social, security, and health issues.
1874	Evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently a gold standard for comprehensive posttraumatic assessment of the knee joint.
1875	Increasing availability of MR systems with stronger magnetic fields and new sequences results in higher resolution of images and thus allows imaging smaller and finer anatomical details, including different anatomical variations.
1876	This article focuses on anatomical variations of knee ligaments, which can mimics pathological structures.
1877	Well-known and less common ligaments that are sporadically observed and may raise the most doubt will be discussed.
1878	Familiarity with those variations of ligaments is indispensable for precise MRI reporting to avoid misinterpretation as meniscal tears, loose bodies or mass lesions especially in cases.
1879	This paper is addressed to both radiology and orthopaedics specialists.
1880	Illustrations show discussed ligaments in standard planes while, for less known ligaments, we add information on how to adjust planes to properly visualise a particular structure, which will hopefully facilitate finding and differentiating those structures in clinical practice.
1881	Awareness of driver workload (DW) plays a paramount role in enhancing driving safety and convenience for intelligent vehicles.
1882	The DW prediction systems proposed so far learn either from individual driver’s data (termed personalized system) or existing drivers’ data indiscriminately (termed average system).
1883	As a result, they either do not work or lead to a limited performance for new drivers without labeled data.
1884	To this end, we develop clustering-aided approaches exploiting group characteristics of the existing drivers’ data.
1885	Two clustering aided predictors are proposed.
1886	The first is clustering-aided regression (CAR) model, where the regression model for the cluster with the highest likelihood is adopted.
1887	The second is clustering-aided multiple model regression model, where the concept of multiple models is further augmented to CAR.
1888	A recent dataset from real-world driving experiments is adopted to validate the algorithms.
1889	Comparative results against the conventional average system demonstrate that by incorporating clustering information, both the proposed approaches significantly improve workload prediction performance.
1890	Motivation-For many RNA families, the secondary structure is known to be better conserved among the member RNAs compared to the primary sequence.
1891	For this reason, it is important to consider the underlying folding structures when aligning RNA sequences, especially for those with relatively low sequence identity.
1892	Given a set of RNAs with unknown structures, simultaneous RNA alignment and folding algorithms aim to accurately align the RNAs by jointly predicting their consensus secondary structure and the optimal sequence alignment.
1893	Despite the improved accuracy of the resulting alignment, the computational complexity of simultaneous alignment and folding for a pair of RNAs is O(N6), which is too costly to be used for large-scale analysis.
1894	Results-In order to address this shortcoming, in this work, we propose a novel network-based scheme for pairwise structural alignment of RNAs.
1895	The proposed algorithm, TOPAS, builds on the concept of topological networks that provide structural maps of the RNAs to be aligned.
1896	For each RNA sequence, TOPAS first constructs a topological network based on the predicted folding structure, which consists of sequential edges and structural edges weighted by the base-pairing probabilities.
1897	The obtained networks can then be efficiently aligned by using probabilistic network alignment techniques, thereby yielding the structural alignment of the RNAs.
1898	The computational complexity of our proposed method is significantly lower than that of the Sankoff-style dynamic programming approach, while yielding favorable alignment results.
1899	Furthermore, another important advantage of the proposed algorithm is its capability of handling RNAs with pseudoknots while predicting the RNA structural alignment.
1900	We demonstrate that TOPAS generally outperforms previous RNA structural alignment methods on RNA benchmarks in terms of both speed and accuracy.
1901	Availability-Source code of TOPAS and the benchmark data used in this paper are available at https://github.com/bjyoontamu/TOPAS.
1902	This paper explores the crucial part that faith-based organisations (FBOs) play in acting as intermediaries between international donors and local faith communities (LFCs) implementing humanitarian relief projects for Syrian refugees.
1903	Humanitarian responses to the mounting Syrian refugee crisis have coincided with greater collaboration between international donors and LFCs.
1904	This cooperation often is facilitated by a complex web of non-state intermediaries at the international, national, and local level.
1905	This study probes the breadth of roles of these intermediaries, drawing on primary data from case studies of two Christian intermediaries supporting Christian LFCs as they deliver aid primarily to Muslim Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon.
1906	The results of the study are connected to the wider literature on LFCs in humanitarian response, revealing how intermediaries address issues of accountability, capacity-building, impartiality, neutrality, and professionalism.
1907	The paper concludes by offering suggestions for further research on intermediaries as key actors in the localisation of humanitarian assistance.
1908	Ring finger protein 216 (RNF216) belongs to the RING family of E3 ubiquitin ligases that are involved in cellular protein degradation.
1909	Mutations in human Rnf216 gene have been identified in Gordon Holmes syndrome, which is defined by ataxia, dementia and hypogonadotropism.
1910	However, the gene function of Rnf216 in mammalian species remains unknown.
1911	Here, we show that targeted deletion of Rnf216 in mice results in disruption in spermatogenesis and male infertility.
1912	RNF216 is not required for female fertility.
1913	These findings reveal an essential function of RNF216 in spermatogenesis and male fertility and suggest a critical role for RNF216 in human gonadal development.
1914	The eukaryotic ribosome is assembled through a complex process involving more than 200 factors.
1915	As pre-ribosomal RNA is transcribed, assembly factors bind the nascent pre-rRNA and guide its correct folding, modification and cleavage.
1916	While these early events in the assembly of the small ribosomal subunit have been relatively well- characterized, assembly of the large subunit precursors, or pre-60S, is less well understood.
1917	Recent structures of nucleolar intermediates of large subunit assembly have shed light on the role of many early large subunit assembly factors but how these particles emerge is still unknown.
1918	Here, we use the overexpression and purification of truncated pre-rRNAs to examine the initial assembly of pre-60S particles.
1919	Using this approach, we can recapitulate the early recruitment of large subunit assembly factors mainly to the domains I, II and VI of the assembling 25S rRNA.
1920	A major challenge in mixed-criticality system design is to ensure safe behavior under the influence of hardware errors while complying with cost and performance constraints.
1921	SeRoHAL generates hardware abstraction layers with software-based safety mechanisms to handle errors in peripheral interfaces.
1922	To reduce performance and memory overheads, SeRoHAL can select protection mechanisms, depending on the criticality of the hardware accesses.
1923	We evaluated SeRoHAL on a robot arm control software.
1924	During fault injection, it prevents up to 76% of the assertion failures.
1925	Selective protection customized to the criticality of the accesses reduces the induced overheads significantly compared to protection of all hardware accesses.
1926	Background-Identifying the status of clinical education helps to improve the achievement of educational goals.
1927	This study aimed to compare the achievement of clinical skills in the final year nursing students.
1928	Materials and Methods-In this descriptive analytical study, 157 nursing students in the seventh and eighth semesters were selected through a census method, who were compared with each other.
1929	Data were collected using a researcher-developed questionnaire that included 111 clinical skills in 7 dimensions of primary nursing care, vital signs control, oxygenation and airway management, medication administration, laboratory samples collection, infection control, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation skills.
1930	Students scored each skill on a scale ranging from 0 to 5.
1931	The acceptable skills level in this study was the third level, which observes skills performed by the instructor or the nurse.
1932	Data were analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, descriptive statistics, and multiple linear regression.
1933	Results-In the seventh semester students, except for the vital signs skills, other skills were at lower than expected levels.
1934	In the eighth semester students, except for the laboratory samples collection and infection control skills which were at a lower than expected level, other skills were reported at expected levels.
1935	Multiple linear regression showed that the eight semester students had more total score than the seventh semester students (t = 3.19, p = 0.002).
1936	Conclusions-The provision of sufficient opportunity to develop clinical skills in the eight semester was observed in this study; therefore, it is recommended that the internship course be increased in the dimensions in which students can independently perform clinical skills.
1937	Metronidazole is one of the first-line treatments for non-severe Clostridium difficile infections (CDI).
1938	However, resistance limits its use in severe and complicated CDI.
1939	Structure-activity relationships previously described in the 5-nitroimidazole series have been shown to enable them, through the functionalization of 2 and 4 positions, to offer better activity against parasites and anaerobic bacteria than metronidazole.
1940	We report herein the synthesis of new 2,4-disubstituted 5-nitroimidazole compounds that show potent antibacterial activity against C. difficile.
1941	We used a Vicarious Nucleophilic Substitution of hydrogen (VNS) reaction to introduce a phenylmethylsulfone in 4-position and a Unimolecular Radical Nucleophilic Substitution (SRN1) reaction to introduce an ethylenic function in 2-position of the 5-nitroimidazole scaffold.
1942	We report the effects of lanthanum-rich layer thickness and forming gas anneal (FGA) conditions on mobility and threshold voltage (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">${V} _{{\text {T}}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) instability of high-mobility 4H-SiC MOSFETs using lanthanum silicate (LaSiO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>) interface engineering.
1943	MOSFETs with LaSiO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> after high-temperature FGA show significantly improved <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">${V} _{\text {T}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> reliability under positive gate bias.
1944	It is found that both the thickness of the initial lanthanum-rich layer and the FGA temperature profoundly influence MOSFET mobility and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">${V} _{\text {T}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> instability under positive bias.
1945	There is a tradeoff between mobility and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">${V} _{\text {T}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> shift under positive bias.
1946	BACKGROUND-Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers and causes of cancer-related death.
1947	Up to approximately 70% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) have metastases to the liver at initial diagnosis.
1948	Second-line systemic treatment in mCRC can prolong survival after development of disease progression during or after first-line treatment and in those who are intolerant to first-line treatment.
1949	OBJECTIVE-The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of transarterial radioembolization (TARE) with TheraSphere yttrium-90 (90Y) glass microspheres combined with second-line therapy in patients with mCRC of the liver who had disease progression during or after first-line chemotherapy.
1950	METHODS-EPOCH is an open-label, prospective, multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial being conducted at up to 100 sites in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia.
1951	Eligible patients have mCRC of the liver and disease progression after first-line chemotherapy with either an oxaliplatin-based or irinotecan-based regimen and are eligible for second-line chemotherapy with the alternate regimen.
1952	Patients were randomized 1:1 to the TARE group (chemotherapy with TARE in place of the second chemotherapy infusion and subsequent resumption of chemotherapy) or the control group (chemotherapy alone).
1953	The addition of targeted agents is permitted.
1954	The primary end points are progression-free survival and hepatic progression-free survival.
1955	The study objective will be considered achieved if at least one primary end point is statistically significant.
1956	Secondary end points are overall survival, time to symptomatic progression defined as Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status score of 2 or higher, objective response rate, disease control rate, quality-of-life assessment by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal Cancer questionnaire, and adverse events.
1957	The study is an adaptive trial, comprising a group sequential design with 2 interim analyses with a planned maximum of 420 patients.
1958	The study is designed to detect a 2.5-month increase in median progression-free survival, from 6 months in the control group to 8.5 months in the TARE group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71), and a 3.5-month increase in median hepatic progression-free survival time, from 6.5 months in the control group to 10 months in the TARE group (HR 0.65).
1959	On the basis of simulations, the power to detect the target difference in either progression-free survival or hepatic progression-free survival is >90%, and the power to detect the target difference in each end point alone is >80%.
1960	RESULTS-Patient enrollment ended in October 2018.
1961	The first interim analysis in June 2018 resulted in continuation of the study without any changes.
1962	CONCLUSIONS-The EPOCH study may contribute toward the establishment of the role of combination therapy with TARE and oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based chemotherapy in the second-line treatment of mCRC of the liver.

1965	The regeneration of cartilage has made great progress in the past few decades， Previous techniques for constructing tissue-engineered cartilage scaffolds mainly include particulate-leaching, gas-foaming, freeze-drying and phase-separation techniques.
1966	Cartilage is heterogeneous, and it is difficult for traditional scaffolds to simulate such anisotropy.
1967	Therefore, the functional regeneration of cartilage is challenging.
1968	With advancements in additive manufacturing, it has become possible to prepare functional bionic scaffolds for structures and components by the codeposition of biological materials, cells and active biomolecules, thereby achieving functional cartilage regeneration.
1969	This paper reviews the applications of 3D printing techniques in the regeneration of cartilage at different anatomical locations, including articular cartilage, meniscus, intervertebral disc and auricle.
1970	In addition, methods for preparing biomimetic constructs with regional structural gradients and regional componential gradients are discussed, with multinozzle 3D bioprinting technology as a future research direction for the functional regeneration and repair of cartilage.
1971	Streptococcus equi subsp.
1972	zooepidemicus (S. zooepidemicus) causes a wide variety of infections in many species.
1973	CD44 is a transmembrane adhesion molecule, expressed by various cell types, which has been implicated in several infection processes.
1974	The aim of this study was to examine the role of CD44 in S. zooepidemicus adherence to LA-4 cells (mouse lung adenoma).
1975	Dose-dependent adhesion with LA-4 may be effectively studied by flow cytometry.
1976	Adherence of S. zooepidemicus is reduced after treatment of cells with anti-CD44 antibody.
1977	Treatment of S. zooepidemicus with recombinant CD44 significantly reduced bacteria adherence.
1978	In addition, CD44 can directly bind to wild-type S. zooepidemicus, while the binding was decreased in the capsule deletion isogenic mutant.
1979	These data suggest that CD44 facilitates adherence of S. zooepidemicus to LA-4 cells.
1980	Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) approaches have achieved a major breakthrough in recent years.
1981	This paper presents a new monocular visual odometry algorithm able to localize in 3D a robot or a camera inside an unknown environment in real time, even on slow processors such as those used in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or cell phones.
1982	The so-called semi-direct visual localization (SDVL) approach is focused on localization accuracy and uses semi-direct methods to increase feature-matching efficiency.
1983	It uses inverse-depth 3D point parameterization.
1984	The tracking thread includes a motion model, direct image alignment, and optimized feature matching.
1985	Additionally, an outlier rejection mechanism (ORM) has been implemented to rule out misplaced features, improving accuracy especially in partially dynamic environments.
1986	A relocalization module is also included but keeping the real-time operation.
1987	The mapping thread performs an automatic map initialization with homography, a sampled integration of new points and a selective map optimization.
1988	The proposed algorithm was experimentally tested with international datasets and compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.
1989	Ball-milled chitin was liquefied with an optimal yield of 92% under sulfuric acid in diethylene glycol (DEG) at 160 °C for 120 min.
1990	The resulting liquid mixture was roughly separated into two portions: the real products of the reaction (liquefied ball-milled chitin, LBMC) and the remaining unreacted DEG.
1991	LBMC was further mingled with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to prepare LBMC/PVA blend membranes.
1992	To promote the direct utilization of shellfishery waste, raw shrimp shells were used to replace chitin for the liquefaction and membrane preparation operations.
1993	Liquefied ball-milled shrimp shells (LBMS) and the corresponding LBMS/PVA blend membranes were obtained.
1994	After adding LBMC or LBMS, the mechanical, thermal, water content and antibacterial performance of blend membranes were significantly improved compared to pure PVA membrane.
1995	Surprisingly, all the measured properties of LBMC/PVA and LBMS/PVA blend membranes were comparable, and even some properties of the latter were slightly superior than those of the former.
1996	Electronic phenotyping is the task of ascertaining whether an individual has a medical condition of interest by analyzing their medical record and is foundational in clinical informatics.
1997	Increasingly, electronic phenotyping is performed via supervised learning.
1998	We investigate the effectiveness of multitask learning for phenotyping using electronic health records (EHR) data.
1999	Multitask learning aims to improve model performance on a target task by jointly learning additional auxiliary tasks and has been used in disparate areas of machine learning.
2000	However, its utility when applied to EHR data has not been established, and prior work suggests that its benefits are inconsistent.
2001	We present experiments that elucidate when multitask learning with neural nets improves performance for phenotyping using EHR data relative to neural nets trained for a single phenotype and to well-tuned baselines.
2002	We find that multitask neural nets consistently outperform single-task neural nets for rare phenotypes but underperform for relatively more common phenotypes.
2003	The effect size increases as more auxiliary tasks are added.
2004	Moreover, multitask learning reduces the sensitivity of neural nets to hyperparameter settings for rare phenotypes.
2005	Last, we quantify phenotype complexity and find that neural nets trained with or without multitask learning do not improve on simple baselines unless the phenotypes are sufficiently complex.
2006	In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Y family DNA polymerase η (Polη) regulates genome stability in response to different forms of environmental stress by translesion DNA synthesis.
2007	To elucidate the role of Polη in oxidative stress-induced DNA damage, we deleted or overexpressed the corresponding gene RAD30 and used transcriptome analysis to screen the potential genes associated with RAD30 to respond to DNA damage.
2008	Under 2 mM H2O2 treatment, the deletion of RAD30 resulted in a 2.2-fold decrease in survival and a 2.8-fold increase in DNA damage, whereas overexpression of RAD30 increased survival and decreased DNA damage by 1.2- and 1.4-fold, respectively, compared with the wild-type strain.
2009	Transcriptome and phenotypic analyses identified Lsm12 as a main factor involved in oxidative stress-induced DNA damage.
2010	Deleting LSM12 caused growth defects, while its overexpression enhanced cell growth under 2 mM H2O2 treatment.
2011	This effect was due to the physical interaction of Lsm12 with the UBZ domain of Polη to enhance Polη deubiquitination through Ubp3 and consequently promote Polη recruitment.
2012	Overall, these findings demonstrate that Lsm12 is a novel regulator mediating Polη deubiquitination to promote its recruitment under oxidative stress.
2013	Furthermore, this study provides a potential strategy to maintain the genome stability of industrial strains during fermentation.IMPORTANCE Polη was shown to be critical for cell growth in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and deletion of its corresponding gene RAD30 caused a severe growth defect under exposure to oxidative stress with 2 mM H2O2 Furthermore, we found that Lsm12 physically interacts with Polη and promotes Polη deubiquitination and recruitment.
2014	Overall, these findings indicate Lsm12 is a novel regulator mediating Polη deubiquitination that regulates its recruitment in response to DNA damage induced by oxidative stress.
2015	Magnesium(ii) complexes, [Mg2+(hfac-)3][Cation+], were prepared as solids from hydrophobic hexafluoroacetylacetonate ionic liquids ([Cation+][hfac-] ILs) and Mg(Tf2N)2.
2016	1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium ([C4mim]), N-butylpyridinium ([C4Pyr]), N-butyl-N-methylpiperidinium ([C4Pip]), N-hexyl-N-methylmorpholinium ([C6Morp]) and N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium ([C4pyrr]) were used as cationic cores.
2017	The [C4Pip][hfac], [C4Pyr][hfac] and [C6Morp][hfac] ILs were prepared for the first time.
2018	New Mg(ii) complexes, [C4mim][Mg(hfac)3], [C4Pip][Mg(hfac)3], [C4Pyr][Mg(hfac)3], [C6Morp][Mg(hfac)3] and [C4Pyrr][Mg(hfac)3], were obtained from the [hfac] based ILs.
2019	The crystal structures of the novel Mg(ii) complexes show the coordination of three [hfac] anions to the Mg2+ ion through the two oxygen atoms of each [hfac] anion.
2020	OBJECTIVE-Performance validity assessment is a crucial component of any neuropsychological evaluation, particularly in settings where potential exaggeration of complaints and deficits is heightened.
2021	Standalone performance validity measures can be time-consuming, so many investigations have explored embedded indices within existing measures.
2022	The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCF) each have a number of available embedded performance validity tests (PVTs).
2023	This investigation sought to evaluate several of these indices and to identify the most effective within a VA mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)/Polytrauma sample.
2024	METHOD-A sample of 100 U.S. military veterans underwent clinical neuropsychological evaluation.
2025	There were 37 individuals whose test results were considered invalid based on failure of 2 or more independent PVTs, 47 whose results were valid, and 16 whose results were equivocal (failure on one PVT).
2026	The classification accuracies of published PVTs from the RAVLT and ROCF were evaluated.
2027	RESULTS-Several indices had sensitivity values above 50% and strong positive predictive power with specificity held over 90%.
2028	CONCLUSIONS-The results demonstrated that there are multiple effective RAVLT & ROCF PVTs available for use in mTBI evaluations with veterans.
2029	Deep learning has been broadly leveraged by major cloud providers such as Google, AWS, Baidu, to offer various computer vision related services including image auto-classification, object identification and illegal image detection.
2030	While many recent works demonstrated that deep learning classification models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, real-world cloud-based image detection services are more complex than classification and there is little literature about adversarial example attacks on detection services.
2031	In this paper, we mainly focus on studying the security of real-world cloud-based image detectors.
2032	Specifically, (1) based on effective semantic segmentation, we propose four different attacks to generate semantics-aware adversarial examples via only interacting with black-box APIs; and (2) we make the first attempt to conduct an extensive empirical study of black-box attacks against real-world cloud-based image detectors.
2033	Through evaluations on five popular cloud platforms including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Baidu Cloud and Alibaba Cloud, we demonstrate that our IP attack has a success rate of approximately 100%, and semantic segmentation based attacks (e.g., SP, SBLS, SBB) have a a success rate over 90% among different detection services, such as violence, politician and pornography detection.
2034	We discuss the possible defenses to address these security challenges in cloud-based detectors.
2035	The attention network test (ANT) assesses efficiency across alerting, orienting, and executive components of visual attention.
2036	This study examined approaches to assessing auditory attention networks, and performance was compared to the visual ANT.
2037	Results showed (1) alerting was sufficiently elicited in a pitch discrimination and sound localization task, although these effects were unrelated, (2) weak orienting of attention was elicited through pitch discrimination, which varied based on ISI and conflict level, but robust orienting of attention was found through sound localization, and (3) executive control was sufficiently assessed in both pitch discrimination and sound localization tasks, but these effects were unrelated.
2038	Correlation analysis suggested that, unlike alerting and orienting, sound localization auditory executive control functions tap a shared attention network system.
2039	Overall, the results suggest that auditory ANT measures are largely task and modality specific, with sound localization offering potential to assess all three attention networks in a single task.
2040	Low-energy extracorporeal shock wave (SW) improves ventricular function in ischemic cardiomyopathy through the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
2041	VEGF is known to play important roles in acute kidney injury (AKI), and the present study investigates the efficacy of SW for AKI by renal ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury.
2042	Male 8-week-old Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into the following groups: SW-treated I/R group (I/R-SW), untreated I/R group (I/R), and Sham group.
2043	To induce I/R, the left renal pedicles were clamped for 45 min.
2044	The I/R-SW group was treated with SW to both kidneys on the immediate postoperative period (day 0), days 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 14, 15, and 16.
2045	Rats were killed on day 2 and day 20 to determine histology, renal function, and Vegf family mRNA expression.
2046	Plasma creatinine on day 2 was significantly lower in the I/R-SW group than in the I/R group.
2047	Light microscopy revealed significantly lower tubular injury scores for the outer medulla in the I/R-SW group than in the I/R group.
2048	Podoplanin-positive lymphatic vessels were significantly increased in the left (affected side) outer medulla in the I/R-SW group on day 20.
2049	The expression levels of Vegf in the right (intact side) cortex were significantly higher in the I/R-SW group than in the I/R group on day 2.
2050	Shock wave ameliorated renal tubular injury and renal function in AKI model, through the stimulation of Vegf family expression and lymphangiogenesis.
2051	SW may be effective as a non-invasive treatment for ischemic AKI.
2052	OBJECTIVE-Electrodiagnostic study (EDX) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are commonly used in the diagnosis of brachial plexopathy, but the agreement between these two studies is unknown.
2053	The aim of this study is to evaluate the agreement of EDX and MRI in patients with brachial plexopathy.
2054	DESIGN-The records of 69 patients with symptoms of brachial plexopathy who underwent EDX and MRI were reviewed.
2055	Based on the degree of agreement of EDX and MRI results, patients were classified as a "complete match," "partial match" and, "mismatch".
2056	RESULTS-Both studies yielded the similar results for the majority of patients (63.2%).
2057	Among the enrolled patients, 26.4% were classified as a "complete match", 36.8% were a "partial match", and 36.8% were as "mismatch".
2058	However, only one test, either EDX or MRI revealed an abnormal findings in 21.1% of patients.
2059	CONCLUSIONS-The agreement between EDX and MRI was high in patients with brachial plexopathy.
2060	However, only one of these test, not both revealed abnormal findings in several cases.
2061	Although both EDX and MRI were in accord with the diagnosis of brachial plexopathy in majority of cases, these two studies remain complementary diagnostic modalities for evaluating brachial plexopathies.
2062	PURPOSE-Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are becoming the standard treatments for Chinese patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring an EGFR mutation.
2063	However, the economic impact is unclear yet in China.
2064	MATERIALS AND METHODS-A decision-analytic model was developed to simulate 1-month patient transitions in a 10-year time horizon from Chinese heath care system perspective.
2065	The health and economic outcomes of four first-line strategies (pemetrexed plus cisplatin [PC], gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib) among NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations were estimated and assessed via indirect comparisons.
2066	Costs in the Chinese setting were estimated by using local hospital data and literatures.
2067	A 5% annual discount rate was applied to both costs and outcomes.
2068	The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
2069	Sensitivity analyses were performed.
2070	RESULTS-Afatinib achieved additional 0.382, 0.216 and 0.174 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with marginal $7930, $3680 and $2818 costs in comparison with PC, gefitinib and erlotinib, which resulted in the ICERs of $20,758, $17,693 and $16,197 per QALY gained, respectively.
2071	The hazard ratios (HR) of overall survival (OS) of afatinib against gefitinib, erlotinib and PC strategy had substantial influential parameters.
2072	CONCLUSIONS-First-line afatinib is cost-effective compared with gefitinib, erlotinib and PC treatment for Chinese patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.
2073	Neonicotinoids are known to have high insecticidal potency, low mammalian toxicity and relatively tough activity for the development of resistance against aphids.
2074	A series of guadipyr insecticides, active against Myzus persicae was engaged in silico studies, based on Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Partial Least Squares regression (PLS), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Pharmacophore modeling.
2075	Robust and predictive models were built using correlations between the insecticidal profile, expressed by experimental pLC50 values, and molecular descriptors, calculated from the energy optimized structures.
2076	Four new potential insecticides active against Myzus persicae and their predicted pLC50 toxicity values were reported for the first time.
2077	The models presented here can be used as an approach in the screening and prioritization of chemicals in a scientific and regulatory frame and for toxicity prediction.
2078	Objective-To investigate differences in gait variability induced by two different single-dose opioid formulations and an inert placebo in healthy volunteers and knee osteoarthritis patients.
2079	Design-Experimental, randomized, double-blinded, crossover study of inert placebo (calcium tablets), 50 mg of tapentadol, and 100 mg of tramadol.
2080	Setting-Laboratory setting.
2081	Subjects-Healthy volunteers and knee osteoarthritis patients.
2082	Methods-At three visits, separated by seven days, one tablet was administered per visit according to the randomization code.
2083	At each visit, a baseline measurement was done before tablet administration, after which hourly measurements were performed for six hours, yielding a total of seven measurements per visit.
2084	Gait variability was measured by three-dimensional gait analysis, recorded during six minutes of continuous treadmill walking at self-selected speed.
2085	One hundred seventy gait cycles were identified from detection of clear events of the knee joint angle trajectories.
2086	Gait variability was assessed as average standard deviations over a gait cycle of the sacrum displacements and accelerations; sagittal plane ankle, knee, and hip joint angles; step widths; and stride times.
2087	Results-Twenty-four opioid-naïve and neurologically intact participants (12 healthy volunteers and 12 knee osteoarthritis patients) were included and completed the experiment.
2088	Tapentadol reduced the variability of sacrum displacements and accelerations compared with placebo and tramadol.
2089	There were no differences between experimental conditions regarding the variability in lower-extremity joint angle variability, step widths, or stride times.
2090	Conclusions-In opioid-naïve and neurologically intact individuals, tapentadol seems to reduce movement variability during treadmill walking, compared with placebo and tramadol.
2091	This can be interpreted as a loss of adaptability that might increase the risk of falling if the system is perturbed.
2092	Anaerobic conditions in waterlogged soil lead to low germination rates, which significantly reduce crop yields.
2093	Good seed germination is prerequisite for direct-seeded cultivation of rice to obtain optimal yields not only in irrigated lowland but most importantly in rain-fed and waterlogged areas where water supply could be more than needed.
2094	Due to the limited availability of rice genotypes suitable for anaerobic germination, there is an urgent need to select diverse rice germplasm with enhanced anaerobic germinability.
2095	In this study, we evaluated 185 rice accessions from six subpopulations for germination rate (AGR) and coleoptile length (ACL) under anaerobic conditions.
2096	The highest average AGR (60%) and longest average ACL (2.13 cm) were observed in tropical japonica (TRJ) and temperate japonica (TEJ) germplasm, respectively.
2097	Meanwhile, the highest proportion of accessions with “very long” ACL was in the TEJ subpopulation, whereas those with the “highest” AGR were in the aus subpopulation based on our criteria.
2098	We selected seven strong accessions for anaerobic germinability (AG) based on AGR and ACL and analyzed the relative expression patterns of four AG-related genes in strong and weak accessions via qRT-PCR.
2099	In general, proton pyrophosphatase locus (OVP3) was expressed at the highest levels in strong accessions, whereas the expression level of rice ethylene response element binding protein locus (EREBP1) did not significantly differ among accessions under normal and anaerobic conditions.
2100	The relative expression results of rice alpha amylase locus (RAmy3D) and OVP3 showed distinct patterns and divided all strong accessions into two groups, suggesting that major genes involved in AG may vary depending on the germplasm.
2101	These findings could be helpful for breeders and lay the foundation for further genetic analysis.
2102	INTRODUCTION-The role of frailty in postmarketing drug safety is increasingly acknowledged.
2103	Few European electronic medical records (EMRs) have been used to explore frailty in observational drug safety research.
2104	OBJECTIVE-The aim of this study was to identify data elements, beyond multimorbidity and polypharmacy, that could potentially contribute to measuring frailty among older adults in the Dutch nationwide Integrated Primary Care Information (IPCI) database.
2105	METHODS-Persons aged between 65 and 90 years in the IPCI database were identified from 2008 to 2013.
2106	Clinical non-disease, non-drug measurements that could potentially contribute to measuring frailty were identified and selected if they were recorded in > 0.005% of patients and could be included in at least one of three definitions of frailty: the frailty phenotype model, the cumulative deficit model, and direct evaluations of frailty through standardized frailty scores.
2107	The frequency of these measures was calculated.
2108	RESULTS-Overall, 314,191 (17% of the source population) elderly persons were identified.
2109	Of these, 7948 (2.53%) had one or more of 12 clinical measurements identified that could potentially contribute to measuring frailty, such as clinical evaluations of cognition, mobility, and cachexia, as well as direct measures of frailty, such as the Groningen Frailty Index.
2110	Three of five measurements required for the frailty phenotype were identified in < 0.5% of the population: cachexia, reduced walking speed, and reduced physical activity; weakness and fatigue were not identified.
2111	The measurements outlined above may be appropriate for the cumulative deficit definition of frailty, provided that at least 30 deficits, including comorbidities and drug utilization, are evaluated in total.
2112	The most commonly recorded item identified that could potentially be used in a cumulative frailty model was the Mini-Mental State Examination score (N= 2850; 0.91%); the only recorded direct measurement of frailty was the Groningen Frailty Index (N = 2382; 0.76%).
2113	CONCLUSION-Non-disease, non-drug clinical data that could potentially contribute to a frailty model was not commonly recorded in the IPCI; less than 3% of a cohort of elderly persons had these data recorded, suggesting that the use of these data in postmarketing drug safety evaluation may be limited.
2114	Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is an important diagnostic method as it enables the quantification of the presence of autoantibodies in human blood sera.
2115	However, unspecific binding of antibodies to the solid phase causes considerable serum-specific background noise (SSBN), involving the risk of false positive diagnosis.
2116	Therefore, we present a simple and concise, yet obvious proof-of-principle of a recently suggested normalization method.
2117	The method is based on subtracting SSBN by using non-coated ELISA wells as a control for each serum-of-interest.
2118	We performed ELISA to quantify anti-fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) antibody levels in three positive controls (two anti-FGFR3-positive patients and a rabbit antiserum against FGFR3) and 58 negative controls (healthy blood donors).
2119	In all subjects, we found considerable unspecific reactivity which strongly varied among subjects.
2120	The conventional normalization method was not able to balance this strong SSBN, as demonstrated by 2/58 false positive healthy controls and one FGFR3-positive patient that was hidden in the noise (false negative).
2121	SSBN normalization reduced the frequency of false-positives to 0/58.
2122	Further, all three anti-FGFR3-positive sera were successfully detected and even doubled their z-score used to determine positivity.
2123	Albeit occupying more space on the ELISA plate, we strongly recommend considering this normalization method when working with blood sera.
2124	To better put the idea across to the community, we depict the SSBN issue and its solution in a graphic scheme.
2125	We conclude that SSBN normalization increases the sensitivity and specificity of indirect ELISA and thereby reduces the risk of false positive and false negative diagnosis.
2126	Abri Herba and Abri mollis Herba both were important members of the Leguminosae family in southwestern China.
2127	Abri mollis Herba was often used as Abri Herba due to their proximity, but there are few studies on pharmacokinetics to compare their main identical active compositions.
2128	A sensitive and selective high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry(HPLC-MS/MS) method in the positive-egative electrospray ionization switching mode was developed and validated for the simultaneous analysis of four flavonoids and two alkaloids in rat plasma.
2129	The chromatographic separation was carried out on a C18 column with a gradient mobile phase consisting of methanol and 0.5‰ acetic acid.
2130	The detection of the target compounds was conducted in multiple-reaction monitoring mode with a hybrid triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with positive-egative ion-switching electrospray ion source.
2131	The differences in pharmacokinetics were discovered, which indicated that the substitution between them is some degree of irrationality.
2132	The validated method was successfully applied to pharmacokinetic study of the six components in male rat plasma after oral administration of Abri Herba and Abri mollis Herba extract and the results in the study would provide a useful guide for the clinical application of Abri Herba with those in Abri mollis Herba.

2135	Exploring efficient non-noble ORR catalysts as alternatives to Pt-based catalysts are highly demanded for their possible application in fuel cells and rechargeable metal-air batteries.
2136	Herein, we demonstrate a rational design and synthesis of a N, P-doped carbon with encapsulated Co nanoparticles as efficient electrocatalysts for ORR.
2137	The catalyst is derived from a mixture of Co-MOF and triphenylphosphine with a mass ratio of 3 : 1 by pyrolysis in N2 atmosphere at 700 °C.
2138	The catalyst exhibited a superior ORR catalytic performance among its counterparts in 0.1 M KOH with onset and half-wave potentials of 0.88 V and 0.80 V, a much larger limiting current density of -5.93 mA cm-2 that surpassed commercial 20% Pt/C, in addition to its durability and resistance to methanol.
2139	This enhanced ORR activity of the catalyst can be attributed to the synergistic effect between Co NPs and N, P atoms, the relatively large contact surface, more exposed active sites and good electrical conductivity.
2140	This study would provide some new ideas for the design and construction of promising carbon-based non-precious metal electrocatalysts for future practical fuel cell applications.
2141	Chorioamnionitis is an intrauterine infection involving inflammation of the chorion, amnion, and placenta.
2142	It leads to a fetal systemic inflammatory response that can alter the transcription of neonatal immune genes.
2143	We have previously shown that neonatal monocytes gain the activating histone tail modification H3K4me3 at promoter sites of immunologically important genes as development progresses from preterm neonate to adult.
2144	In this study, we applied ChIP-seq and RNA-seq to evaluate the impact of chorioamnionitis on the neonatal monocyte H3K4me3 histone modification landscape over the course of fetal and neonatal immune system development.
2145	Chorioamnionitis exposure in neonatal monocytes resulted in a net increase in total monocyte H3K4me3, primarily in introns and intergenic regions.
2146	Immune gene expression was decreased in chorioamnionitis-exposed monocytes, with the majority of enriched transcripts falling into pathways that are not linked to the immune system.
2147	Over half of all neonatal monocyte H3K4me3 peaks, independent of their location, were associated with active gene transcription.
2148	Overall, chorioamnionitis exposure resulted in the global remodeling of the neonatal monocyte H3K4me3 landscape and changes in the expression of known immune genes.
2149	These changes resulted in a less robust inflammatory response upon exposure to a secondary challenge, which may explain why chorioamnionitis-exposed neonates have an increased risk of sepsis.

2151	Searchable encryption (SE) provides a privacy-preserving mechanism for data users to search over encrypted data stored on a remote server.
2152	Researchers have designed a number of SE schemes with high efficiency yet allowing some degree of leakage profile to the remote server.
2153	The leakage, however, should be further measured to allow us to understand what types of attacks an SE scheme would encounter.
2154	This paper considers passive attacks that make inferences based on prior knowledge and observations on queries issued by users.
2155	This is in contrast to previously studied active attacks that adaptively inject files and queries.
2156	We consider several assumptions on the types or prior knowledge the attacker possessed and propose a few passive attacks.
2157	In particular, under the “full-fledged” assumption, the keyword recovery rate of our attack is optimal in the sense that it is equal to the theoretical upper bound.
2158	We further present several enhanced attacks under other weaker assumptions on various levels of the prior knowledge that the attacker can obtain, in which the keyword recovery rates are optimal or nearly optimal (i.e., approaching the theoretical upper bound).
2159	In addition, we provide extensive experiments to show the “power” of our passive attacks.
2160	This paper highlights the importance of minimizing the prior knowledge of a server and the leakage of search queries.
2161	It also shows that simply distorting the frequency of the keyword to hold against our passive attacks may not scale well.
2162	A randomized clinical study was conducted to evaluate the effects on anxiety, depression, stress and optimism levels of an audio-recorded clinical hypnosis intervention and a music session and compare them with a control group in women scheduled for breast biopsy.
2163	We analyzed the data of 170 patients with an average age of 47 years, who were randomly assigned to each of the groups.
2164	The psychosocial variables were measured in three moments: baseline, which corresponds to the period before the intervention with hypnosis, music or waiting in the room before biopsy; a second measurement after the interventions and a third measurement after the breast biopsy procedure was finished.
2165	The results showed a statistically significant reduction in the stress (p < .001, η2p = .06); pain, (p < .01, η2p = .04); anxiety, (p < .001, ƞ2p = .07) and depression, (p < .001, ƞ2p = .05) in hypnosis and music groups compared with the control group.
2166	Before biopsy, hypnosis decrease significantly pain and depression levels compared with music, but after biopsy there were no differences between both groups.
2167	It is recommended to use audio-recorded hypnosis and music interventions to reduce physical and emotional discomfort during the biopsy procedure and to improve the quality of life of patients with suspected breast cancer.
2168	Distinguishing sources of groundwater contamination in regions with multiple potential sources can be challenging using conventional markers.
2169	In this study, isotopes of nitrate (δ15NNO3 and δ18ONO3) were examined in conjunction with other hydrochemical parameters to better distinguish sources of groundwater contamination, where intensive agriculture occurs adjacent to a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP).
2170	High nitrate concentrations were found in groundwater both within the WWTP site and surrounding market garden farms (maximum of 99 mg/L and 78 mg/L nitrate as N, respectively).
2171	Ranges and median δ15NNO3 values showed clear differences between sample groups.
2172	In groundwater close to the WWTP, δ15NNO3 and δ18ONO3 values ranged from 10.4 to 41.2‰ and -0.5to 21.3‰, respectively, indicating predominantly sewage-sourced nitrate, while samples within market gardens showed evidence of mixed fertilizer (manure and synthetic) sourced nitrate, with δ15NNO3 and δ18ONO3 values between 7.2 and 29.8‰ and 0.4 to 15.1‰, respectively.
2173	Nitrate interpreted to be derived from the WWTP was also typically associated with elevated ammonia as N (median concentration of 17 mg/L) and SO4 (median concentration of 350 mg/L).
2174	These distinctive signatures allowed for clearer delineation of the extent and overlap between different contaminant plumes than otherwise possible.
2175	Geochemical conditions in groundwater surrounding the WWTP appear to promote denitrification, evident through enrichment in δ15NNO3 and δ18ONO3 and reduced nitrate concentrations between sampling rounds (locally).
2176	However, isotopic signatures in market garden areas showed no evidence of denitrification, and groundwater exhibited conditions likely to preserve nitrate (e.g.
2177	dissolved oxygen levels >2 mg/L).
2178	There is limited evidence of nitrate contamination currently impacting a nearby groundwater dependent ecosystem (Tootgarook Swamp), located down-gradient from the WWTP.
2179	This research demonstrates that a combination of hydrochemical and isotope data can help resolve sources of groundwater contamination and characterise nutrient degradation behaviour in settings with multiple inputs.
2180	Although intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is an extranodal lymphoma characterized by the selective growth of lymphoma cells within the lumina of small vessels, we here report three autopsy cases of IVLBCL characterized by the proliferation within large blood vessels.
2181	These three cases were diagnosed as IVLBCL of the bone marrow or skin biopsy.
2182	Two cases died suddenly before treatment, whereas the other died during treatment.
2183	Autopsies showed a large embolus of dense lymphoma cells extending from the truncus pulmonalis to the pulmonary arteries in Case 1, emboli of lymphoma cells in the aorta and carotis in Case 2, and a mass of lymphoma cells blocking the lumen of the aortic arch in Case 3.
2184	This is the first report of IVLBCL involving large blood vessels, and it is essential to note that this type of IVLBCL might cause sudden death because of tumor emboli within large blood vessels.
2185	Conventional influenza vaccines are hampered by slow and limited production capabilities, whereas DNA vaccines can be rapidly produced for global coverage in the event of an emerging pandemic.
2186	However, a drawback of DNA vaccines is their generally low immunogenicity in non-human primates and humans.
2187	We have previously demonstrated that targeting of influenza hemagglutinin to human HLA class II molecules can increase antibody responses in larger animals such as ferrets and pigs.
2188	Here, we extend these observations by immunizing non-human primates (rhesus macaques) with a DNA vaccine encoding a bivalent fusion protein that targets influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) to Mamu class II molecules.
2189	Such immunization induced neutralizing antibodies and antigen-specific T cells.
2190	The DNA was delivered by pain- and needle-free jet injections intradermally.
2191	No adverse effects were observed.
2192	Most importantly, the immunized rhesus macaques were protected against a challenge with influenza virus.
2193	The present study attempted to identify potential key genes and miRNAs of dyslipidemia in obese, and to investigate the possible mechanisms associated with them.
2194	The microarray data of GSE66676 were downloaded, including 67 obese samples from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.
2195	The weighted gene co-expression network (WGCNA) analysis was performed using WGCNA package and grey60 module was considered as the highest correlation.
2196	Gene Ontology annotation and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses for this module were performed by clusterProfiler and DOSE package.
2197	A protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was established using Cytoscape software, and significant modules were analyzed using molecular complex detection.
2198	Collagen type I alpha 1 chain gene (COL1A1) had the best significant meaning.
2199	After bioinformatic analysis, we identified four miRNAs (hsa-miR-3659, hsa-miR-4658, hsa-miR151a-5p and hsa-miR-151b) which can bind SNPs in 3′UTR in COL1A1.
2200	After validation with RT-qPCR, only two miRNAs (hsa-miR-3659 and hsa-miR151a-5p) had statistical significance.
2201	The area of 0.806 for miR-3659 and 0.769 for miR-151a-5p under the ROC curve (AUC) may have good diagnostic value for dyslipidemia.
2202	Circulating miR-3659 may be a potential biomarker of dyslipidemia in patients with obesity.
2203	BACKGROUND-Maternal depression and anxiety have distinct constellations of symptom trajectories, which are associated with factors that may vary between different groups of women.
2204	The aim of this study was to identify subgroups of women who exhibit unique longitudinal trajectory patterns of depressive and anxiety symptoms from pregnancy to 5 years postpartum and the antenatal predictors associated with these maternal groups.
2205	METHODS-The study used a longitudinal data collected from 615 women in Saskatchewan from pregnancy to 5 years postpartum.
2206	Semiparametric group-based models were used to identify latent maternal depressive and anxiety trajectory groups.
2207	Multinomial logit models were then used to assess the association between maternal characteristics and the identified latent trajectory groups.
2208	RESULTS-We identified four trajectory groups of maternal depressive symptoms: low-stable (35%); moderate-stable (54%); moderate-increasing (5%); and high-decreasing (6%), and three trajectory groups of maternal anxiety symptoms: very low-stable (13%); low-stable (58%); and moderate-stable (29%).
2209	We also identified several risk factors, most notably history of depression and stress, that were significantly associated with these trajectories.
2210	CONCLUSION-History of depression and increased stress are significant risk factors that can be identified during regular perinatal visits; therefore, clinicians should inquire about these risk factors to identify women at high risk of ongoing depression or anxiety.
2211	BACKGROUND-We have previously demonstrated that VWF is essential in platelet-specific FVIII (2bF8) gene therapy of hemophilia A (HA) with inhibitory antibodies (inhibitors).
2212	At the site of injury, platelet adherence is initiated by VWF binding to the platelet GPIb complex.
2213	OBJECTIVE-To investigate the impact of GPIbα on platelet gene therapy of HA with inhibitors.
2214	METHODS-Platelet-FVIII expression was introduced by 2bF8 lentivirus (2bF8LV) transduction of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from GPIbαnull (Ibnull ) mice or rhF8-primed FVIIInull (F8null ) mice followed by transplantation into lethally irradiated rhF8-primed F8null recipients.
2215	Animals were analyzed by flow cytometry, FVIII assays, and the tail bleeding test.
2216	RESULTS-After transplantation, 99% of platelets were derived from donors.
2217	The macrothrombocytopenia phenotype was maintained in F8null mice that received 2bF8LV-transduced Ibnull HSCs (2bF8-Ibnull /F8null ).
2218	The platelet-FVIII expression level in 2bF8-Ibnull /F8null recipients was similar to that obtained from F8null mice that received 2bF8LV-transduced F8null HSCs (2bF8-F8null /F8null ).
2219	The tail bleeding test showed that the remaining hemoglobin level in the 2bF8-Ibnull /F8null group was significantly higher than in the F8null control group, but there was no significant difference between the 2bF8-Ibnull /F8null and 2bF8-F8null /F8null groups.
2220	The half-life of inhibitor disappearance time was comparable between the 2bF8-Ibnull /F8null and 2bF8-F8null /F8null groups.
2221	The rhF8 rechallenge did not elicit a memory immune response once inhibitor titers dropped to undetectable levels after 2bF8 gene therapy.
2222	CONCLUSION-GPIbα does not significantly impact platelet gene therapy of HA with inhibitors.
2223	2bF8 gene therapy restores hemostasis and promotes immune tolerance in HA mice with pre-existing immunity.

2226	Previous neuroimaging studies have shown that functional changes occur after acute sleep deprivation, which suggest detrimental effects of a lack of sleep on the intrinsic functional architecture of the brain.
2227	We aimed to identify regional resting perfusion changes in subjects with acute sleep deprivation.Thirty-three healthy subjects with habitual good sleep participated in 36 hours (2 days and 1 night) of sleep deprivation and then underwent the attention network test and pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling scanning.
2228	Regional cerebral blood flow was used to compare cerebral perfusion before and after sleep deprivation.
2229	Correlation analyses of regional perfusion changes and scores on the attention network test were performed.Compared with the baseline (n = 20) scans, the scans of subjects after sleep deprivation (n = 26) revealed a slower response time (549.99 milliseconds vs 603.36 milliseconds; t = -2.301; P = .028) and a significantly higher lapse rate (0.88% vs 22.85%; t = -2.977; P = .006).
2230	The sleep deprivation subjects showed lower cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the left parahippocampal gyrus/fusiform cortex (pHipp/Fus), right pHipp/Fus, and right prefrontal cortex (PFC) relative to the baseline subjects (Gaussian random field correction, voxel level P < .01, and cluster level P < .05).
2231	Although no significant relationships were observed between the altered regional CBF (rCBF) values and the attention network test scores, the receiver-operating characteristic and leave-one-out cross-validation analyses revealed that significant decreases in rCBF in the bilateral pHipp/Fus and right PFC could discriminate between sleep deprivation and good sleep status.We observed that rCBF was reduced after 36 hours (2 days and 1 night) of sleep deprivation.
2232	Our preliminary findings suggest an acute vulnerability to hypoperfusion due to lack of sleep.
2233	BACKGROUND-The recommendation of non-indicated caesarean section (CS) after 39 gestational weeks has been announced based on evidence of maternal and infant physiological effects.
2234	The potential psychological risks have not been acknowledged.
2235	This study aims to investigate emotional and behavioral problems in pre-school children born with elective CS (ECS) on maternal request prior to 39 weeks.
2236	METHODS-Pregnant women within 12 gestational weeks between November 2008 and October 2010 were invited to participate in the China-Anhui Birth Cohort Study (C-ABCS).
2237	They were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire respectively in 1st and 3rd trimester of pregnancy to collect basic maternal characteristics.
2238	Pregnant complications and delivery modes were abstracted from medical notes.
2239	Their singleton live births were followed up at preschool age.
2240	Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQ) were completed by parents to assess children's emotional and behavioral problems.
2241	A total of 3319 mother-child pairs were put into the final analysis.
2242	Descriptive analysis and binary logistic regression analysis were used to assess the impact of delivery modes on abnormalities in SDQ dimensions at various gestational ages.
2243	RESULTS-The prevalence of ECS on maternal request prior to 39 weeks, at 39-40 weeks, and after 41 weeks was 16.6, 23.7 and 15.9%, respectively.
2244	Compared with those born vaginally, children born with ECS on maternal request were more likely to have total difficult problems (RR 1.519, 95% confidence interval 1.077 to 2.142).
2245	ECS on maternal request was the independent predictor of emotional problems (3.479, 1.676 to 7.222) and total difficult problems (2.172, 1.175 to 4.016) in children born prior to 39 gestational weeks.
2246	CONCLUSION-Children delivered by ECS on maternal request have an increased risk to have emotional and behavioral problems prior to 39 gestational weeks at preschool age.
2247	The potential psychological implication prior to 39 weeks has been added to the roster of impacts of ECS on maternal request.
2248	Further research is needed to probe the potential biological mechanisms.
2249	BACKGROUND-Both anterior decompression and fusion (ADF) and laminoplasty (LAMP) are frequently used for the treatment of cervical myelopathy due to ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL).
2250	However, some controversies still remained in surgical options.
2251	We investigated whether ADF had better neurological outcome than LAMP in the treatment of cervical myelopathy due to OPLL.
2252	Secondary outcomes included operation time, blood loss, rate of complication and reoperation.
2253	METHODS-PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials database were searched to identify potential clinical studies compared ADF with LAMP for treatment of cervical myelopathy owing to OPLL.
2254	We also manually searched the reference lists of articles and reviews for possible relevant studies.
2255	Quality assessment was performed according to Cochrane Handbook and meta-analysis was conducted using Stata 12.0 software.
2256	RESULTS-Nine studies involving 712 patients were finally included in this analysis.
2257	Compared with LAMP, ADF was associated with an increase of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score (WMD = 1.86, 95% CI 0.43 to 3.29, P = .011) and recovery JOA score at final follow-up (WMD = 30.94, 95% CI 20.56 to 41.33, P = .000).
2258	And, ADF was associated with a decrease of the late neurologic deterioration than LAMP group (RR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.92, P = .003).
2259	However, ADF was associated with an increase of the postoperative cervical lordosis (WMD = 4.47, 95% CI 1.58 to 7.36, P = .002) than LAMP.
2260	There was no significant difference between the complication, reoperation rate (P > .05).
2261	What's more, ADF was associated with an increase of the operation time than LAMP (P < .05).
2262	CONCLUSIONS-ADF yields better neurological improvement, but higher cervical lordosis and longer operation time compared with LAMP for cervical myelopathy caused by OPLL.
2263	No significant difference was found in the complication and re-operation rate.
2264	Paracetamol aqueous solutions, when ozonized, acquired a strong red coloration depending on the applied ozone dose and the initial pH of the aqueous solution.
2265	Then, this color loses intensity and turns to yellow.
2266	Color formation is favored when operating at initial pH0 = 12.0 and ozone flow-rate 4.2 mg/min.
2267	A mechanism describing color formation was proposed, being the main pathway involved an initial paracetamol hydroxylation to yield 3-hydroxyacetaminophen followed by the formation of 2-amino-5-hydroxyacetofenone.
2268	Then, these compounds are degraded to colored oxidation by-products.
2269	A model describing color evolution was also proposed, considering first-order kinetics for both color formation and degradation.
2270	The corresponding kinetic constant values were determined to be kf = 0.01 (1/min) and kd = 0.03 pH -0.055 (1/min), respectively.
2271	A relationship between aromaticity loss and color changes during the reaction has been estimated considering the parameter α=kA/kf, being α = 1.62 pH + 3.5 and the first-order rate constant for aromaticity loss given by kA = 0.0162 pH + 0.035 (1/min).
2272	Simultaneous photoreduction and Raman spectroscopy with 532 nm laser has been used to study the effects of organophosphate (chlorpyrifos) exposure on human red blood cells.
2273	Since in red blood cells, auto-oxidation causes oxidative stress, which, in turn, is balanced by the cellular detoxicants, any possible negative effect of chlorpyrifos on this balance should results in an increased level of damaged (permanently oxygenated) hemoglobin.
2274	Therefore, when 532 nm laser, at a suitable power, was applied to photoreduce the cells, only common oxygenated form of hemoglobin got photoreduced leaving the permanently oxygenated hemoglobin detectable in the Raman spectra simultaneously excited by the same laser.
2275	Using the technique effects of chlorpyrifos to build up oxidative stress on red blood cells could be detected at concentrations as low as 10 ppb from a comparison of relative strengths of different Raman bands.
2276	Experiments performed using simultaneously exposing the cells, along with chlorpyrifos, to H2 O2 (oxidative agent) and/or 3-Aminotriazole (inhibitor of anti-oxidant catalase), suggested role of chlorpyrifos to suppress the cellular anti-oxidant mechanism.
2277	Since the high level of damaged hemoglobin produced by the action of chlorpyrifos (at concentrations > 100 ppm) is expected to cause membrane damage, atomic force microscopy was used to identify such damages.
2278	Upper panel: Raman spectra of normal, photoreduced chlorpyrifos exposed and unexposed red blood cells.
2279	Lower panel: The weak Fe-O2 Raman band for chlorpyrifos exposed cells shown on the left.

2284	Bacterial biofilms, surface-attached communities of cells, are in some respects similar to colloidal solids; both are densely packed with non-zero yield stresses.
2285	However, unlike non-living materials, bacteria reproduce and die, breaking mechanical equilibrium and inducing collective dynamic responses.
2286	We report experiments and theory investigating the motion of immotile Vibrio cholerae, which can kill each other and reproduce in biofilms.
2287	We vary viscosity by using bacterial variants that secrete different amounts of extracellular matrix polymers, but are otherwise identical.
2288	Unlike thermally-driven diffusion, in which diffusivity decreases with increased viscosity, we find that cellular motion mediated by death and reproduction is independent of viscosity over timescales relevant to bacterial reproduction.
2289	To understand this surprising result, we use two separate modeling approaches.
2290	First we perform explicitly mechanical simulations of one-dimensional chains of Voigt-Kelvin elements that can die and reproduce.
2291	Next, we perform an independent statistical approach, modeling Brownian motion with the classic Langevin equation under an effective temperature that depends on cellular division rate.
2292	The diffusion of cells in both approaches agrees quite well, supporting a kinetic interpretation for the effective temperature used here and developed in previous work.
2293	As the viscoelastic behavior of biofilms is believed to play a large role in their anomalous biological properties, such as antibiotic resistance, the independence of cellular diffusive motion --- important for biofilm growth and remodeling --- on viscoelastic properties likely holds ecological, medical, and industrial relevance.
2294	Tumor vascular normalization theory opened the door for the rational use of antiangiogenic agents and chemotherapeutics.
2295	However, efforts to seize the normalization window have constrained the development of vascular normalization therapy in clinical applications owing to the lack of circulating biomarkers and the tedious dosage regimes.
2296	Applying "Occam's Razor" to therapeutic design inspired us to construct an effective and simple tumor vascular normalization prompting strategy.
2297	Herein, we developed tumor vessel normalization prompting nanomedicine lipid derivative conjugates (LGCs) made of anti-angiogenic agents with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and gemcitabine (Gem).
2298	This treatment exploits the complementary action of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy and metronomic chemotherapy (MET) to strengthen the tumor vascular normalization effect.
2299	Furthermore, by loading cytotoxic drugs, such as paclitaxel (PTX), into the LGCs we constructed a "nano-community" to simultaneously restore the tumor vasculature and deliver the loaded drugs.
2300	Accordingly, improved drug delivery and therapeutic outcomes were achieved with no need to identify the precise time of the normalization window.
2301	Overall, our studies suggest that tumor vessel normalization therapy and nanomedicine design could be combined in one entity, using two waves of normalization strategies to achieve optimal chemo drug delivery into solid tumors.
2302	Information regarding vector-parasite association is necessary for fully understanding the epidemiology of vector borne diseases yet, this information is lacking in the case of Leucocytozoonosis in the Oriental region, despite a high incidence of the disease.
2303	In this study, we used a molecular approach based on mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) sequence to detect the parasite, Leucocytozoon, in potential black fly (Simuliidae) vectors in Thailand.
2304	A total of 404 wild caught black flies representing six morphological species of two subgenera were examined.- Gomphostilbia (Simulium asakoae complex, S. chumpornense) and Simulium (S. chamlongi, S. nodosum, S. nigrogilvum).
2305	Forty-four black fly specimens from two species of the Gomphostilbia were positive for Leucocytozoon.
2306	Most (35) of these were found in a village where high numbers of domestic chicken were kept, consistent with the possibility that chickens are a host of Leucocytozoon species found in black flies.
2307	Sixteen haplotypes were identified among 44 cyt b sequences.
2308	Comparisons of the sequences with previous reports revealed that the 11 haplotypes obtained in this study were identical or very similar to unknown Leucocytozoon found in infected domestic chickens.
2309	Four haplotypes are genetically similar to L. schoutedeni and one haplotype is genetically very different from existing cyt b sequences in public database.
2310	Our results indicate that two black fly species of the subgenus Gomphostilbia in Thailand are possible vectors of Leucocytozoon transmitted among poultry and wild birds in the country.
2311	G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptors (GPCRs) mediate responses to hormones, metabolites, lipids, and neurotransmitters at the cell membrane, and so they are prominent drug targets.
2312	Although many structural, biochemical, cell biological, and biophysical studies made remarkable progress to understand mechanisms of GPCR signaling, there still are many unanswered questions about arrestin-dependent GPCR signaling.
2313	In this chapter, we focus on optical assays to see muscarinic receptor-arrestin interactions with ensemble FRET and single-molecule TIRF imaging in live cells and finally to integrate the information to simulate hypothesized steps in Virtual Cell.
2314	Nurses may see patients who have recently returned from tropical vacations complaining of a severe pruritic dermatitis known as seabather's eruption (SBE).
2315	Caused by exposure to jellyfish larvae, SBE is characterized by a pruritic rash, but some patients, particularly children, experience systemic signs and symptoms such as fever, chills, and nausea/vomiting.
2316	This article discusses SBE and reviews assessment tips, nursing care, and patient teaching.
2317	The purpose of this study is to investigate gas flow through different types of granular fill materials and soil by means of a series of experimental laboratory tests, in relation to soil depressurisation systems for radon reduction under buildings and the soil surrounding the foundation.
2318	Gas permeability characterisation of materials used as granular fill material beneath the slab in buildings is a key parameter for the optimum performance of soil depressurisation systems to mitigate radon.
2319	A test apparatus was developed, adapted from previous studies, to measure the gas permeability of the samples and Finite Element Method numerical simulations were validated to simulate the flow behaviour through them.
2320	Theoretical expressions for permeability were discussed based on the analysis of experimental results and numerical simulations, finding that Darcy-Forchheimer equation provides the best match to the experimental results.
2321	Darcy's law also proved to be suitable for low gas velocities, whereas Ergun's equation resulted in a poor fit of the experimental data.
2322	Benchmark analysis of the granular fill materials under study and other European standards (Spanish, Irish and British) is also presented.
2323	To compare the growth and biosynthetic ability of long-chain PUFA (LC-PUFA) of the genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT) (Oreochromis niloticus) in different water salinities, an 8-week feeding trial was conducted on the GIFT juveniles at 0, 12 and 24 ‰ (parts per thousand; ppt), respectively, with three isonitrogenous (32 %) and isolipidic (8 %) diets (D1-D3).
2324	Diet D1 with fish oils (rich in LC-PUFA) as lipid source was used as the control, while D2 and D3 with vegetable oil (free LC-PUFA) blends as lipid source contained different ratios of linoleic acid (LA, 18 : 2n-6) and α-linolenic acid (ALA, 18 : 3n-3) at 4·04 (D2) and 0·54 (D3), respectively.
2325	At the end of feeding trial, the growth performance of D2 and D3 groups under all salinity treatments was as good as that of D1 group, which indicates that the GIFT juveniles may convert dietary LA and ALA into LC-PUFA to meet the requirement of essential fatty acids for normal growth and physiology.
2326	When fed the same diets, GIFT at 12 ppt had a better growth performance coupled with a higher liver and muscle arachidonic acid content than those in freshwater.
2327	Furthermore, brackish water (24 ppt) significantly promoted the mRNA levels of elongase 5 of very long-chain fatty acids (elovl5) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (pparα) in liver, when compared with freshwater.
2328	These results suggest that the GIFT may display better growth performance together with a relatively higher endogenous LC-PUFA biosynthetic ability under brackish water (12 and 24 ppt), probably through improving the expression of elovl5 and pparα in liver.
2329	Through whole-transcriptome profiling of HER2+ breast carcinomas (BCs), we previously showed that those sensitive to trastuzumab are addicted to this oncoprotein and are enriched in immune pathways, raising the hypothesis that HER2 itself regulates immune cell recruitment.
2330	In the present study we investigated the relationship between HER2 activity and the pro-trastuzumab tumor immune milieu.
2331	Gene expression profiling and immunohistochemistry analysis of 53 HER2+ BCs showed that trastuzumab-sensitive tumors expressed significantly higher levels of chemokines involved in immune cell recruitment, with higher infiltration of T cells and monocytes, and higher levels of PD-1 ligands than tumors that do not benefit from trastuzumab.
2332	In vitro analysis in HER2+ BC cells revealed that CCL2 production was induced by HER2 stimulation with EGF/HRG via the PI3K-NF-kB axis, and down-modulated by HER2 inhibition with trastuzumab.
2333	CCL2 expression was higher in HER2+/ER- than HER2+/ER+ BC cell lines, and degradation of ER by fulvestrant induced an enhancement in NF-κB transcriptional activity and consequent CCL2 expression.
2334	Trastuzumab efficacy relied on CCL2 levels and monocytes present in the tumor microenvironment in FVB mice bearing HER2+ mammary carcinoma cells.
2335	HER2 signals were also found to sustain the expression of PD-1 ligands in tumor cells via the MEK pathway.
2336	Overall, our results support the concept that the activated HER2 oncogene regulates recruitment and activation of tumor infiltrating immune cells and trastuzumab activity by inducing CCL2 and PD-1 ligands and that ER activity negatively controls the HER2-driven pro-trastuzumab tumor microenvironment.
2337	Developed over six decades ago, pulmonary oscillometry has re-emerged as a noninvasive and effort-independent method for evaluating respiratory-system impedance in patients with obstructive lung disease.
2338	Here, we evaluated the relationships between hyperpolarized 3 He ventilation-defect-percent (VDP) and respiratory-system resistance, reactance and reactance area (AX ) measurements in 175 participants including 42 never-smokers without respiratory disease, 56 ex-smokers with chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease (COPD), 28 ex-smokers without COPD and 49 asthmatic never-smokers.
2339	COPD participants were dichotomized based on x-ray computed-tomography (CT) evidence of emphysema (relative-area CT-density-histogram ≤ 950HU (RA950 ) ≥ 6.8%).
2340	In asthma and COPD subgroups, MRI VDP was significantly related to the frequency-dependence of resistance (R5-19 ; asthma: ρ = 0.48, P = 0.0005; COPD: ρ = 0.45, P = 0.0004), reactance at 5 Hz (X5 : asthma, ρ = -0.41, P = 0.004; COPD: ρ = -0.38, P = 0.004) and AX (asthma: ρ = 0.47, P = 0.0007; COPD: ρ = 0.43, P = 0.0009).
2341	MRI VDP was also significantly related to R5-19 in COPD participants without emphysema (ρ = 0.54, P = 0.008), and to X5 in COPD participants with emphysema (ρ = -0.36, P = 0.04).
2342	AX was weakly related to VDP in asthma (ρ = 0.47, P = 0.0007) and COPD participants with (ρ = 0.39, P = 0.02) and without (ρ = 0.43, P = 0.04) emphysema.
2343	AX is sensitive to obstruction but not specific to the type of obstruction, whereas the different relationships for MRI VDP with R5-19 and X5 may reflect the different airway and parenchymal disease-specific biomechanical abnormalities that lead to ventilation defects.
2344	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that have tissue- and cell-specific expression.
2345	They have the ability to regulate the malignant proliferation and transformation of tumour cells.
2346	The research focussed on the expression and role of miR-1297 in melanoma.
2347	We firstly found that miR-1297 is up-regulated in melanoma tissues and cell lines.
2348	Functionally, phosphatase and tension homology deleted on chromsome ten gene (PTEN) was used as a potential target for miR-1297 and detected using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC).
2349	We then used chemical synthesis of anti-miR1297 to explore the influence on melanoma cells and examined the effects on A375 cell proliferation using MTT and western blotting methods.
2350	The results showed that anti-miR-1297 transfected A375 cells could inhibit the growth.
2351	Furthermore, transfection with anti-miR-1297 reduced PTEN protein expression and partially restrained A375 cells proliferation, migration and reversed Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) progression.
2352	In conclusion, we tentatively put forward that miR-1297 might be the key oncomiR in melanoma, and seed-targeted anti-miR-1297 might serve as a new tactic for miR-1297-based therapies.
2353	WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE-The target trough concentration of tacrolimus for ulcerative colitis is recommended to be 10-15 ng/mL in the initial two weeks and 5-10 ng/mL in the later phase.
2354	However, the effectiveness of rapid attainment of these target trough concentrations of tacrolimus in patients with ulcerative colitis is still unclear.
2355	In the present study, we evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety of rapid attainment of target trough concentrations of tacrolimus in patients with ulcerative colitis.
2356	METHODS-A prospective cohort was conducted at Gifu University Hospital in Gifu, Japan.
2357	Hospitalized patients who received tacrolimus for the treatment of ulcerative colitis between April 2009 and March 2017 were enrolled.
2358	Since June 2011, the initial loading dose of tacrolimus increased from 0.05 to 0.1-0.2 mg/kg/d, and the maintenance dose to achieve the target trough concentration was determined to be 12.5 ng/mL by proportional calculation with measured blood concentration.
2359	The period required to attain target trough concentration and the clinical efficacy before and after dosage modification was compared.
2360	RESULTS-The initial dose after dosage modification was significantly increased compared to that before dosage modification (0.10 [0.04-0.22], median [range] mg/kg/d vs 0.05 [0.03-0.05] mg/kg/d, P < 0.001).
2361	The period required to attain a target trough concentration over 10 ng/mL was significantly shortened by dosage modification (6 [4-14] days before dosage modification vs 4.5 [2-8] days after modification, P = 0.048).
2362	Further, stool frequency score was significantly improved after dosage modification, without affecting the incidence of adverse events.
2363	WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION-Our findings suggest that rapid attainment of the target trough concentration of tacrolimus improves clinical symptoms in patients with ulcerative colitis.
2364	There are hundreds of thousands metric tons of microplastics (MPs) present in aquatic environments.
2365	The MPs coexist with other pollutants in water bodies, such as pharmaceuticals, and may carry and transfer them into aquatic organisms, consequently causing unpredictable ecological risks.
2366	The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the presence of polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) on the distribution and bioaccumulation of roxithromycin (ROX) in freshwater fish red tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) as well as their interactive biochemical effects in red tilapia.
2367	PS-MPs were found to enhance the bioaccumulation of ROX in fish tissues compared to ROX-alone exposure.
2368	In the treatment of PS-MPs (100 μg L-1) combined with ROX (50 μg L-1), the highest concentrations of ROX reached 39,672.9 ± 6311.4, 1767.9 ± 277.8, 2907.5 ± 225.0, and 4307.1 ± 186.5 μg kg-1 in gut, gills, brain, and liver, respectively.
2369	Furthermore, compared to the ROX alone, the neurotoxicity caused by ROX was alleviated due to the presence of MPs after 14 d of exposure.
2370	The activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes [7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and 7-benzyloxy-4-trifluoromethyl-coumarin O-dibenzyloxylase (BFCOD)] in fish livers exposed to all co-exposure treatments exhibited great variability compared to ROX alone after 14 d of exposure, suggesting that the presence of MPs may affect the metabolism of ROX in tilapia.
2371	Compared with ROX alone, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity increased significantly, and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents decreased in the co-exposure treatments, showing that oxidative damage in situations of co-exposure to MPs and ROX was mitigated in fish livers after 14 d of exposure.
2372	Collectively, the presence of MPs could affect the fate and toxicity of other organic pollutants in fish.
2373	The results emphasize the importance to study the interactions between MPs and other organic pollutants in aquatic environments.
2374	Optical multiplexing is of great importance in information processing, and offers the opportunity to dramatically increase the capacity of information systems.
2375	For example, multiplexing among different physical dimensions of light is regarded as an efficient means to substantially increase the capacity of optical data storage (ODS).
2376	Alternatively, the capacity can also be increased by multilevel coding.
2377	In this paper, we report on the combination of multiplexing among multiple physical dimensions and multilevel coding simultaneously to dramatically boost the capacity of ODS.
2378	The physical mechanism relies on the excitation power dependent thermal reshaping of the ODS medium mediated by wavelength and polarization sensitive random hot spots in a volume of coupled disordered gold nanorods (GNRs).
2379	The resulting electric field intensity varies drastically inside the focus spot of a laser beam when different combinations of polarization and wavelength are used.
2380	Therefore, different hot spots can be selectively activated and encoded by controlling the power of the recording beam, facilitating the realization of the polychromatic and polarized multiplexing of multilevel coding in the disordered plasmonic structure.
2381	Our results might find applications in high capacity optical data storage, watermarking, etc.
2382	Microbial contamination of bovine raw milk often occurs at the farm.
2383	To acquire a deeper knowledge of the microbiota of farm tank milk, we studied milk from 45 farms situated in 2 geographical areas in Norway.
2384	Each farm was visited on 3 different occasions, with at least 2 wk between visits.
2385	We combined both bacterial cell counts and a sequence variant inference method of amplicon-based high-throughput sequencing to achieve a high-resolution overview of the microbiota in each sample.
2386	Compositional variation of the farm milk microbiota was shown in relation to the 2 areas, between the farms and between the sampling times.
2387	Despite the near constant level of bacteria enumerated in milk from each individual farm, the dominant microbiota differed significantly between the samplings.
2388	The predominant microbiota was dominated by spoilage genera, such as Pseudomonas and Bacillus, as well as the dairy fermentation genus Lactococcus and mastitis-causing organisms (Streptococcus).
2389	Analysis of the identified sequence variants within these genera showed that the populations of Pseudomonas and Lactococcus in milk had similar composition between the farms, but that Bacillus and, in particular, Streptococcus populations changed between collection days from the same farm and between farms and geographical areas.
2390	Furthermore, the levels and composition of Bacillus and Paenibacillus were different between the 2 geographical areas.
2391	The results presented here provide new insight into the farm milk microbiota and show that this microbiota is a dynamic community highly subject to variation.
2392	OBJECTIVE-To evaluate the feasibility and clinical value of magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with fluorescein sodium staining (FLS) in the resection of high-grade glioma (HGG) in functional brain areas.
2393	METHODS-Retrospective cohort study design.
2394	The data of 95 patients who underwent surgery for HGG at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University for HGGin functionalbrain areas from October 2014 to December 2017 were investigated.
2395	In the observation group, 49 patients underwent DTI preoperatively and received FLS for the removal of tumour during the operation.
2396	In the control group, 46 patients received the routine method.
2397	All patients were subjected to enhanced MRI to assess the extent of tumour resection within 72 h after operation.
2398	The changes in muscle strength and Karnofsky performance scale(KPS) scores were evaluated one month after surgery.
2399	RESULTS-The extent of resection was significantly higher in the observation group than that in the control group (83.7% vs. 45.7%,P＜0.001).The rate of muscle strength reduction after surgery was remarkably lower in the observation group than in the control group (20.4% vs.47.8%，P=0.005).
2400	KPS scores werehigher in the observation group than in the control group (73.5% vs. 47.8%，P=0.029).
2401	In the observation group, the sensitivity of FLS in identifying tumour tissue was 91.7% (44/48), with a specificity of 90.0% (45/50).
2402	CONCLUSIONS-The application of DTI with FLS can facilitate themaximum resection of HGG in functionalbrain areas with minimum loss of fibretracts, reduce the disability rate and improve the quality of postoperative life compared with traditional glioma surgery.
2403	Aberrant over-expression of BCL-2 family proteins (BCL-2, BCL-xL, MCL-1) are associated with hematological malignancies.
2404	Antagonists of BCL-2 family proteins include BCL-2-selective inhibitor ABT-199, MCL-1-selective inhibitor A-1210477, BCL-xL-selective inhibitor A-1155463.
2405	In this study, we evaluated their potential inhibitory effectiveness.
2406	Our data showed that OCI-AML3 cells and U937 cells were resistant to BCL-2-selective inhibitor ABT-199 in vitro and in vivo, however, while OCI-AML3 cells were sensitive to MCL-1-selective inhibitor A-1210477 in vitro and in vivo, indicating that A-1210477 could counteract the resistance of AML cells to ABT-199 as a single agent in MCL-1-dependent AML cells.
2407	U-937 cell line and mouse model were resistant to A-1210477 or ABT-199, and expressed high level of BCL-xL, indicating that BCL-xL might play an important role in the resistance of A-1210477 or ABT-199.
2408	Besides, this study also showed that ABT-199 could synergize with A-1210477 in vitro or in vivo.
2409	Claudins are cell-cell adhesion molecules located at the tight junctions (TJs) between cells in epithelial cell sheets.
2410	The claudin family in mammals consists of 27 four-transmembrane domain proteins.
2411	Claudins are responsible for the paracellular barrier function of TJs, and in some cases confer paracellular channel functions to the paracellular barriers of TJs.
2412	Based on recent breakthroughs in the molecular structure of claudins, the hypothetical 'antiparallel double row model' was proposed, which suggests how claudins polymerize in a linear fashion and form TJ strands with paracellular barrier and channel functions.
2413	Meanwhile, ongoing studies at the cell and tissue levels are clarifying how the paracellular barrier and/or channel functions of claudin-based TJs, which are both robust and flexible, organize various biological systems.
2414	SIDS occurs in early infancy and predominantly during a sleep period.
2415	Abnormalities in nicotine receptor binding and in the expression of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits α7 and β2 have been reported in the brainstem of SIDS infants.
2416	This study focuses on the α3 and α4 nAChR subunits as α3 is important for early postnatal survival while α4 is crucial for nicotine-elicited antinociception and sleep-wake cycle regulation.
2417	Tissue from the rostral medulla of infants who died with a known cause of death (eSUDI, n = 7), and from SIDS classified as SIDS I (n = 8) and SIDS II (n = 27), was immunohistochemically stained for the α3 and α4 nAChR subunits and quantified in 9 nuclei comparing amongst these groups.
2418	The association with risk factors of sex, cigarette smoke exposure, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), prone sleeping and bedsharing was also evaluated.
2419	Results showed that only α4 changes (increase) were evident in SIDS, occurring in the hypoglossal and cuneate nuclei of SIDS II infants and the nucleus of the spinal trigeminal tract of SIDS I infants.
2420	Amongst the SIDS infants, cigarette smoke exposure was only associated with decreased α4 in cribriform fibre tracts, while sex and bedsharing were associated with increases in α3 in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and solitary nucleus, respectively.
2421	Combined, these findings suggest that abnormalities in endogenous acetylcholine synthesis and regulation may underlie the altered α3 and α4 nAChR subunit expressions in the SIDS brainstem medulla since the changes were not related to cigarette smoke exposure.
2422	The objective of this study was to present heritability estimates and accuracy of genomic prediction using different methods for meat quality traits in Nelore cattle.
2423	Approximately 5000 animals with phenotypes and genotypes of 412,000 SNPs, were divided into two groups: (1) training population: animals born from 2008 to 2013 and (2) validation population: animals born in 2014.
2424	A single-trait animal model was used to estimate heritability and to adjust the phenotype.
2425	The methods of GBLUP, Improved Bayesian Lasso and Bayes Cπ were performed to estimate the SNP effects.
2426	Accuracy of genomic prediction was calculated using Pearson's correlations between direct genomic values and adjusted phenotypes, divided by the square root of heritability of each trait (0.03-0.19).
2427	The accuracies varied from 0.23 to 0.73, with the lowest accuracies estimated for traits associated with fat content and the greatest accuracies observed for traits of meat color and tenderness.
2428	There were small differences in genomic prediction accuracy between methods.
2429	Nowadays, two-factor data security protection has become a research hotspot in smart ocean management.
2430	With the increasing popularity of smart ocean management, how to achieve the two-factor protection of public data resources in smart ocean management is a serious problem to be tackled.
2431	Furthermore, how to achieve both security and revocation is also a challenge for two-factor protection.
2432	In this paper, we propose a two-factor-based protection scheme with factor revocation in smart ocean management.
2433	The proposed scheme allows data owners (DOs) to send encrypted messages to users through a shipboard server (SS).
2434	The DOs are required to formulate access policy and perform attribute-based encryption on messages.
2435	In order to decrypt, the users need to possess two factors.
2436	The first factor is the user's secret key.
2437	The second factor is security equipment, which is a sensor card in smart ocean system.
2438	The ciphertext can be decrypted if and only if the user gathers the key and the security equipment at the same time.
2439	What is more, once the security equipment is lost, the equipment can be revoked and a new one is redistributed to the users.
2440	The theoretical analysis and experiment results indeed indicate the security, efficiency, and practicality of our scheme.
2441	To overcome the high separation cost of microalgae, natural microalgae granulation was performed in open sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) by treating synthetic wastewater.
2442	After operation for 60 days, easily settled algae granules were obtained with an average size of 0.61 mm, sludge volume index (SVI) of 125 ml/g and settling velocity of 12.2 m/h.
2443	More extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) (∼252 mg/g-VSS) were detected to excrete with a higher proteins/polysaccharides (PN/PS) ratio (∼7) for the algae granules on day 60, which are beneficial for granulation.
2444	Meanwhile, the algae granules were found to have a higher phosphorus (P) content (33.4 mg-P/g-TSS) with higher P bioavailability (91.8%) when compared to the seed algae (20.4 mg-P/g-TSS).
2445	The obtained algae granules possess great potential for P recovery and reuse.
2446	Magnetic control has been a prosperous and powerful contactless approach in arraying materials into high-order nanostructures.
2447	However, it is tremendously difficult to control organic polymers in this way on account of the weak magnetic response.
2448	The preparation of block copolymers (BCPs) with high magnetostatic energy is reported here, relying on an effective electrostatic coupling between paramagnetic ions and polymer side chains.
2449	As a result, the BCPs undergo a magnetically directed self-assembly to form microphase-segregated nanostructures with long-range order.
2450	It is emphasized that such a precisely controlled alignment of the BCPs is performed upon a single commercial magnet with low-intensity field (0.35 Tesla).
2451	This strategy is profoundly easy-to-handle in contrast to routine electromagnetic methods with high-intensity field (5-10 Tesla).
2452	More significantly, the paramagnetic metal component in the BCP samples can be smartly removed, providing a template effect with a preservation of the directed self-assembled nanofeatures for patterning follow-up functionalized species through the original binding site.
2453	This study was conducted to characterize canine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs); in vivo tracking in mice, and therapeutic evaluation in canine clinical paraplegia cases.
2454	Canine BMSCs were isolated, cultured, and characterized in vitro as per International Society for Cellular Therapy criteria, and successfully differentiated to chondrogenic, osteogenic, and adipogenic lineages.
2455	To demonstrate the homing property, the pGL4.51 vector that contained luciferase reporter gene was used to transfect BMSCs.
2456	Successfully transfected cells were injected around the skin wound in mice and in vivo imaging was done at 6, 12 and 24 hr post MSCs delivery.
2457	In vivo imaging revealed that transfected BMSCs migrated and concentrated predominantly toward the center of the wound.
2458	BMSCs were further evaluated for allogenic therapeutic potential in 44 clinical cases of spinal cord injuries (SCI) and compared with conventional therapy (control).
2459	Therapeutic potential as evaluated by different body reflexes and recovery score depicted significantly better results in stem cell-treated group compared to control group.
2460	In conclusion, allogenic canine BMSCs can serve as potent therapeutic candidate in cell-based therapies, especially for diseases like SCI, where the conventional medication is not so promising.
2461	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is characterized by abnormal lymphoblasts accumulation in the bone marrow and blood.
2462	Despite great efforts have been made in exploring novel therapeutic method, the prognosis of children with ALL is still unsatisfied.
2463	Glucocorticoid (GC) resistance is a great obstacle for the clinical treatment of ALL.
2464	Therefore, it is essential to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the GC resistance.
2465	According to previous reports, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in drug resistance of various human cancers.
2466	LncRNA HOXA cluster antisense RNA2 (HOXA-AS2) has been reported in several human malignancies due to its oncogenic property.
2467	However, the molecular mechanism of HOXA-AS2 involved in the GC resistance of ALL still needs to be further clarified.
2468	At first, we found that lncRNA HOXA-AS2 was highly expressed both in prednisone insensitive ALL cell lines and patient samples.
2469	Gain or loss-of-function assays revealed that HOXA-AS2 enhanced GC resistance via promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting cell apoptosis.
2470	Furthermore, we validated that HOXA-AS2 upregulated HOXA3, thereby activating EGFR/Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.
2471	Our findings showed that HOXA-AS2 may be a potential therapeutic target for ALL patients with poor GC resistance.
2472	BACKGROUND-The objective of this study was to contribute to an OR efficiency optimisation effort by comparing a trauma OR versus a scheduled surgery OR in a lower limb orthopaedic surgery department.
2473	HYPOTHESIS-The main hypothesis is that efficiency is lower in the trauma OR than in the scheduled surgery OR.
2474	The secondary hypothesis is that efficiency of the trauma OR is lower during weekends.
2475	MATERIAL AND METHODS-This prospective study was conducted in 2016 in the orthopaedic surgery department of a university hospital.
2476	Patients were divided into three groups based on whether they underwent scheduled surgery (SchOS), trauma surgery on a weekday (TSwk), or trauma surgery on a weekend (TSwkend).
2477	Actual OR occupancy time, allocated OR block time (BT), OR occupancy rate, patient entrance-to-incision time, incision-to-closure time, closure-to-post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) entrance time, and clean-up/set-up time (T4) were measured.
2478	RESULTS-We included 691 patients in the SchOS group, 819 in the TSwk group, and 327 in the TSwkend group.
2479	OR efficiency was lower in the TSwk group compared to the SchOS group (occupancy rate, 86% vs. 88%; p=10-4).
2480	All occupancy time components were longer in the TSwk group.
2481	However, each component accounted for similar total occupancy time proportions in the two groups, except for clean-up/set-up time, which was longer in the TSwk group (p<0.05).
2482	On average, entrance-to-incision time accounted for 31%, incision-to-closure time for 34%, closure-to-PACU time for 18%, and clean-up/set-up time for 17% of total occupancy time.
2483	Efficiency was lower in the TSwkend group than in the TSwk group (occupancy rate, 75% vs. 86%; p=10-4).
2484	The TSwkend group had shorter entrance-to-incision and incision-to-closure times (p<0.05) and a nearly 10% longer clean-up/set-up time (p<0.05).
2485	CONCLUSION-Efficiency of the trauma OR, although lower compared to the scheduled orthopaedic surgery OR, was nevertheless satisfactory as assessed based on standard indicators.
2486	Of the four total occupancy time components, the first three accounted for similar proportions of the total; differences occurred only for clean-up/set-up time.
2487	Efforts to improve OR efficiency should focus on arrival of the first patient and turnover time.
2488	LEVEL OF EVIDENCE-II, prospective cohort study.
2489	Various methods are applied in the treatment of fresh and neglected Monteggia fractures.
2490	The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of various treatment methods, and assess the complexity associated with missed radial head dislocation.All fracture patients were reviewed between Jan 2012 and Dec 2016.
2491	A detailed comparison was made of the treatment methods between fresh Monteggia fractures and neglected Monteggia fractures with missed diagnosis of dislocation.A preliminary analysis of clinical information from 1081 patients in our center was investigated, and 42 were included in the final analysis.
2492	The fresh group included 25 patients with an average Mayo Elbow Performance Score of 96.3 ± 2.7 and resulted in the following scores after treatment: 21 excellent, 3 good, and 1 fair.
2493	In the fresh group, 76% of patients received closed reduction.
2494	Treatment with a cast, elastic stable intramedullary nail, and the Kirschner wire stabilization with tension band wiring make up 80% of the choices for fixation treatment.
2495	No patients experienced associated vascular injuries, recurrent dislocation, or elbow dysfunction.
2496	The neglected group involved 17 patients with Mayo Elbow Performance Score of 92.1 ± 9.3 and resulted in the following scores after treatment: 10 excellent, 4 good, and 3 fair.
2497	The locking compression plate (LCP) was the most common choice for postoperative immobilization in the neglected group (88.2%).
2498	Three patients in the neglected group experienced recurrent dislocation.This retrospective analysis indicates that the treatment of neglected Monteggia fractures is more complex than that of fresh Monteggia fractures, and usually results in a worse recovery rate with a higher rate of recurrent dislocation and elbow dysfunction.
2499	Experimental data for waveguide-coupled surface-plasmon-polariton (SPP) cones generated from dielectric waveguides is presented.
2500	The results demonstrate a simpler route to collect plasmon waveguide resonance (i.e., PWR) data.
2501	In the reverse-Kretschmann configuration (illumination from the sample side) and Kretschmann configuration (illumination from the prism side), all the waveguide modes are excited simultaneously with p- or s-polarized incident light, which permits rapid acquisition of PWR data without the need to scan the incident angle or wavelength, in the former configuration.
2502	The concentric SPP cone properties depend on the thickness and index of refraction of the waveguide.
2503	The angular intensity pattern of the cone is well-matched to simulation results in the reverse-Kretschmann configuration, and is found to be dependent on the polarization of the incident light and the polarization of the waveguide mode.
2504	In the Kretschmann geometry, all waveguide-coupled SPP cones are measured at incident angles that produce attenuated light reflectivity.
2505	In addition, the enhanced electric field produced under total internal reflection allows high signal-to-noise ratio multimodal spectroscopies (e.g., Raman scattering, luminescence) to measure the chemical content of the waveguide film, which traditionally is not measured with PWR.
2506	This study systematically analyzed the effects of amoxicillin (AMX) on the nitrogen transformation and its corresponding functional bacterial communities by conducting two aerobic composting experiments, and AMX impact on bacterial community succession was also evaluated.
2507	It provides theoretical and methodological support for harmless composting treatment of large quantities of manure containing AMX in China and for the high-quality compost products.
2508	The results showed that AMX exerted several effects on basic physicochemical and biological compost parameters.
2509	Notably, temperature changes typically accompanying compost maturation were delayed in AMX compost, reflecting altered compost maturation kinetics and bacterial community structure.
2510	Moreover, relative to control, AMX inhibited growth and reproduction of dominant bacterial phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with respective reductions of 17.8-26.1% and 0-7.76% in relative abundance (RA) and significantly increased Proteobacteria RA by 1.9-24.8%.
2511	Thus, AMX altered both compost bacterial community structure and succession.
2512	From the perspective of various nitrogen content changes, AMX has a significant effect on nitrogen conversion and release.
2513	Simultaneously, AMX may inhibit ammoniated and ammonia-oxidizing bacterial activity, while significantly increasing the RA of denitrifying bacteria.
2514	Indeed, during early composting with AMX, the RA of denitrifying bacteria was 1361.9-1435.0% of control, highlighting differences in nitrogen transformation and release between groups.
2515	Aerosol transmission of pathogens can result in the rapid spread of disease.
2516	Introduction of a mobile air recirculation system based on high-efficiency particulate air filtration, photochemical oxidation, and germicidal ultraviolet light significantly decreased the bacterial load by over 40% under routine care in an emergency department.
2517	Application of this new technology promises to reduce the aerosol pathogen burden, thereby decreasing exposure risk and providing a safer environment for patient care.
2518	Time data can be found in various real-world applications and different models have been proposed to model temporal information.
2519	With the wide utilization of the Web and the availability of massive Web resources, temporal Resource Description Framework (RDF) model has attracted more and more attention.
2520	In this paper, we propose an index approach for temporal RDF graphs to effectively query massive temporal RDF data.
2521	We build the prefix path index for querying subjects of temporal RDF triples and the suffix index for querying objects of temporal RDF triples, respectively.
2522	Meanwhile, we use frequent elements to improve the efficiency of the index we proposed.
2523	We also adopt B-tree index to manage all elements of triples.
2524	Our index approach can support inserting and deleting temporal triples in temporal RDF graphs.
2525	Experimental results show that our index approach can efficiently process queries in temporal RDF graphs.
2526	The human papillomavirus (HPV) 58 is considered to be the second most predominant genotype in cervical cancer incidents in China.
2527	HPV type-restriction, non-targeted delivery, and the highcost of existing vaccines necessitate continuing research on the HPV vaccine.
2528	We aimed to explore the papillomaviral proteome in order to identify potential candidates for a chimeric vaccine against cervix papilloma using computational immunology and structural vaccinology approaches.
2529	Two overlapped epitope segments (23⁻36) and (29⁻42) from the N-terminal region of the HPV58 minor capsid protein L2 are selected as capable of inducing both cellular and humoral immunity.
2530	In total, 318 amino acid lengths of the vaccine construct SGD58 contain adjuvants (Flagellin and RS09), two Th epitopes, and linkers.
2531	SGD58 is a stable protein that is soluble, antigenic, and non-allergenic.
2532	Homology modeling and the structural refinement of the best models of SGD58 and TLR5 found 96.8% and 93.9% favored regions in Rampage, respectively.
2533	The docking results demonstrated a HADDOCK score of -62.5 ± 7.6, the binding energy (-30 kcal/mol) and 44 interacting amino acid residues between SGD58-TLR5 complex.
2534	The docked complex are stable in 100 ns of simulation.
2535	The coding sequences of SGD58 also show elevated gene expression in Escherichia coli with 1.0 codon adaptation index and 59.92% glycine-cysteine content.
2536	We conclude that SGD58 may prompt the creation a vaccine against cervix papilloma.
2537	Short cationic lipopeptides are amphiphilic molecules that exhibit antimicrobial activity mainly against Gram-positives.
2538	These compounds bind to bacterial membranes and disrupt their integrity.
2539	Here we examine the structure-activity relation (SAR) of lysine-based lipopeptides, with a prospect to rationally design more active compounds.
2540	The presented study aims to explain how antimicrobial activity of lipopeptides is affected by the charge of lipopeptide headgroup and the length of lipopeptide acyl chain.
2541	The obtained SAR models suggest that the lipophilicity of short synthetic cationic lipopeptides is the major factor that determines their antimicrobial activities.
2542	In order to link the differences in antimicrobial activity to the mechanism of action of lipopeptides containing one and two hydrophobic chains, we additionally performed molecular dynamic (MD) simulations.
2543	By using combined coarse-grained and all-atom simulations we also show that these compounds neither affect the organization of the membrane lipids nor aggregate to form separate phases.
2544	These results, along with the onset of antimicrobial activity of lipopeptides well below the critical micelle concentration (CMC), indicate that lipopeptides do not act in a simple detergent-like manner.
2545	PURPOSE-The aim of this study was to determine if implementing an evidence-based, nurse-driven sepsis protocol would reduce acute care transfer (ACT) readmissions from an inpatient rehabilitation facility compared to nonprotocolized or usual standard of care for adult sepsis patients undergoing physical rehabilitation.
2546	DESIGN-This study used a preintervention and postintervention model for quality improvement, which involved comparing the nonprotocolized care of adult sepsis patients in the inpatient rehabilitation population to the application of an evidence-based, nurse-driven sepsis protocol to determine its effect on reducing ACT readmissions.
2547	METHODS-Patients who screened positive for suspected sepsis and received protocolized interventions were analyzed to determine the occurrence of ACT readmission.
2548	Compliance with protocol elements was also evaluated.
2549	FINDINGS-The sepsis-related ACT readmission rate decreased from 36.28% to 25% in 8 weeks, and compliance with protocolized sepsis interventions increased.
2550	CONCLUSIONS-Nurse-driven, protocolized assessment and treatment can improve the management and care of sepsis patients undergoing physical rehabilitation and can reduce ACT readmissions.
2551	CLINICAL RELEVANCE-This review provides rehabilitation nurses an evidence-based, nurse-driven approach to the clinical management of sepsis patients in the inpatient rehabilitation setting and discusses how this approach can reduce ACT readmissions and improve clinical outcomes.
2552	Research into the relationship between happiness and health is developing rapidly, exploring the possibility that impaired happiness is not only a consequence of ill-health but also a potential contributor to disease risk.
2553	Happiness encompasses several constructs, including affective well-being (feelings of joy and pleasure), eudaimonic well-being (sense of meaning and purpose in life), and evaluative well-being (life satisfaction).
2554	Happiness is generally associated with reduced mortality in prospective observational studies, albeit with several discrepant results.
2555	Confounding and reverse causation are major concerns.
2556	Associations with morbidity and disease prognosis have also been identified for a limited range of health conditions.
2557	The mechanisms potentially linking happiness with health include lifestyle factors, such as physical activity and dietary choice, and biological processes, involving neuroendocrine, inflammatory, and metabolic pathways.
2558	Interventions have yet to demonstrate substantial, sustained improvements in subjective well-being or direct impact on physical health outcomes.
2559	Nevertheless, this field shows great potential, with the promise of establishing a favorable effect on population health.
2560	Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Public Health Volume 40 is April 1, 2019.
2561	Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.
2562	PURPOSE-Management of leptomeningeal metastasis-related hydrocephalus (LM-H) is particularly challenging regarding the control of severe headache, nausea, and vomiting due to intracranial hypertension.
2563	To investigate the improvements of performance status and outcome with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt surgery for LM-H in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.
2564	METHODS-Data on patients with leptomeningeal metastasis-related hydrocephalus from lung adenocarcinoma diagnosed by MR imaging and/or cytological examination were retrospectively analyzed.
2565	Between August 2008 and July 2017, the authors reviewed 31 patients requiring CSF shunt, who underwent ventriculo-peritoneal or lumbo-peritoneal shunt.
2566	RESULTS-The patients consisted of 11 men and 20 women with a median age of 59 years.
2567	Twenty-six patients received EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).
2568	CSF shunt surgery yielded rapid improvement in the performance status of 90.3% of patients.
2569	Median overall survival from the diagnosis of LM in patients with ECOG performance status less than 2 was 7.7 months, and this was significantly longer than those in patients with PS 3 or 4 (4.4 or 1.5 months; p<0.001).
2570	Multivariate analysis by Cox regression revealed survival differences according to PS at diagnosis of LM [PS 1-3 vs. PS4, hazard ratio (HR) 0.201, p = 0.034], controlled extracranial disease (HR 0.248, p = 0.005), and post-shunt EGFR-TKI for LM treatment (HR 0.193, p = 0.008).
2571	Postoperative symptomatic peritoneal carcinomatosis was observed in one patient (3.2%).
2572	CONCLUSION-CSF shunting may be a safe and effective strategy in patients with LM-H from lung adenocarcinoma.
2573	A prospective study is needed to establish the effectiveness and safety of palliative CSF shunt for LM-H.
2574	OBJECTIVE To assess the feasibility of esophageal insufflation CT (EICT) for evaluation of the esophagus in dogs.
2575	ANIMALS 7 clinically normal adult Beagles.
2576	PROCEDURES Each dog was anesthetized twice with 1 week between anesthesia sessions.
2577	Dogs were positioned in sternal recumbency during all CT scans.
2578	During the first anesthesia session, a CT scan was performed before the esophagus was insufflated (insufflation pressure, 0 mm Hg) and unenhanced and contrast-enhanced EICT scans were performed after CO2 was insufflated into the esophageal lumen to achieve a pressure of 5 mm Hg.
2579	For the contrast-enhanced scan, each dog received iohexol (600 mg/kg, IV), and the scan was performed 30 seconds later.
2580	During the second anesthesia session, unenhanced and contrast-enhanced EICT scans were performed in the same manner except the insufflation pressure achieved was 10 mm Hg.
2581	The esophageal luminal cross-sectional area and wall thickness were measured at each of 5 segments, and mean values were compared among the 3 insufflation pressures and between unenhanced and contrast-enhanced images.
2582	RESULTS Mean esophageal luminal cross-sectional area increased and esophageal wall thickness decreased as insufflation pressure increased.
2583	Measurements did not differ significantly between unenhanced and contrast-enhanced images.
2584	The stomach became distended with CO2 at an insufflation pressure of 10 mm Hg but not at 5 mm Hg.
2585	No adverse effects were observed.
2586	CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggested EICT was feasible for esophageal evaluation in dogs.
2587	Further research is necessary to determine the optimal insufflation pressure for the procedure and its diagnostic efficacy in diseased patients.
2588	The visual color-word Stroop task is widely used in clinical and research settings as a measure of cognitive control.
2589	Numerous neuroimaging studies have used color-word Stroop tasks to investigate the neural resources supporting cognitive control, but to our knowledge all have used unimodal (typically visual) Stroop paradigms.
2590	Thus, it is possible that this classic measure of cognitive control is not capturing the resources involved in multisensory cognitive control.
2591	The audiovisual integration and crossmodal correspondence literatures identify regions sensitive to congruency of auditory and visual stimuli, but it is unclear how these regions relate to the unimodal cognitive control literature.
2592	In this study we aimed to identify brain regions engaged by crossmodal cognitive control during an audiovisual color-word Stroop task, and how they relate to previous unimodal Stroop and audiovisual integration findings.
2593	First, we replicated previous behavioral audiovisual Stroop findings in an fMRI-adapted audiovisual Stroop paradigm: incongruent visual information increased reaction time towards an auditory stimulus and congruent visual information decreased reaction time.
2594	Second, we investigated the brain regions supporting cognitive control during an audiovisual color-word Stroop task using fMRI.
2595	Similar to unimodal cognitive control tasks, a left superior parietal region exhibited an interference effect of visual information on the auditory stimulus.
2596	This superior parietal region was also identified using a standard audiovisual integration localizing procedure, indicating that audiovisual integration resources are sensitive to cognitive control demands.
2597	Facilitation of the auditory stimulus by congruent visual information was found in posterior superior temporal cortex, including in the posterior STS which has been found to support audiovisual integration.
2598	The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, often implicated in unimodal Stroop tasks, was not modulated by the audiovisual Stroop task.
2599	Overall the findings indicate that an audiovisual color-word Stroop task engages overlapping resources with audiovisual integration and overlapping but distinct resources compared to unimodal Stroop tasks.
2600	OBJECTIVE-To describe the palmar arthroscopic approaches to the bovine carpus and document the visible intra-articular structures in each approach.
2601	STUDY DESIGN-Ex vivo study.
2602	SAMPLE POPULATION-Thirty fresh cadaveric bovine forelimbs.
2603	METHODS-Computed tomography (CT) and gross dissection were performed on 4 carpi.
2604	Latex models were produced from 6 carpi to define the gross anatomy and arthroscopic portals to the palmar carpal pouches.
2605	Ultrasonography and arthroscopy were performed on 20 carpi to document visualization of the local anatomy.
2606	RESULTS-A single palmar pouch was present on both sides of each joint on gross dissection and evaluation of latex models.
2607	The relationship between pouches and palmar structures was observed by CT. Small anechoic areas identified on ultrasonography increased after joint distension.
2608	Palmar arthroscopy of the antebrachiocarpal joint enabled visualization of the palmar surfaces of radial, intermediate, and ulnar carpal bones; distal radius; ulnar styloid process; palmar radiocarpal ligament; and articulation of accessory and ulnar carpal bones.
2609	Palmar arthroscopy of the middle carpal joint enabled inspection of the palmar aspects of ulnar, intermediate, radial, fused second and third and fourth carpal bones, palmar carpometacarpal ligament, and the short lateral collateral ligament.
2610	Palmar aspects of the fourth and fifth metacarpal bones were explored through the palmarolateral approach to the middle carpal joint.
2611	Instrument portals for each pouch were created under arthroscopic guidance.
2612	CONCLUSION-Palmar arthroscopy of the adult bovine carpus enabled visualization of the clinically relevant palmar intra-articular structures.
2613	CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE-Palmar carpal arthroscopy should be considered as an adjunct to dorsal approach for the diagnosis and treatment of bovine carpal diseases.
2614	The antibacterial effect of PHBV films with oregano or clove essential oil, or their main compounds, carvacrol (CA) and eugenol (EU), respectively, was analysed in food matrices (cheese, chicken breast and pumpkin and melon) and in vitro test for Escherichia coli and Listeria innocua.
2615	The migration of CA and EU in the different food matrices was determined to analyse the food matrix effect on the film's antimicrobial effectiveness.
2616	The antimicrobial activity in foods was less remarkable than in in vitro test.
2617	Despite the antilisterial effect in the in vitro test, this was not noticed in any food matrix.
2618	The most significant antibacterial effects against E. coli were observed in cheese and pumpkin, whereas the highest migration of both CA and UE took place in melon.
2619	This lack of correlation reflected that many compositional factors affect the active compound's availability to exert its antibacterial action in a specific food.
2620	BACKGROUND Older adults who are discharged following emergency department evaluation are at increased risk for functional decline and health care utilization, and are likely to benefit from close follow-up and additional care services.
2621	Understanding factors associated with a return emergency department visit within 30 days among older fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries discharged to the community may assist in identifying patients at greatest need for interventions.METHOD Predictors from Medicare data and public sources were evaluated in a retrospective data analysis of North and South Carolina residents (2011-2012) aged ≥ 65 years using Cox regression proportion hazards ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for time-to-30-day return events.RESULTS 30-day return rates varied markedly among the 167 emergency department facilities studied (18%-39%).
2622	Predictors of 30-day return included: age (85+ versus 65-74; HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.22-1.27); male sex (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.14-1.10); non-white race (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.05-1.09); Medicaid eligibility (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.18-1.22); Charlson Score (3+ vs. 0; HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.30-1.36); and prior emergency department encounter (3+ vs. 0; HR, 2.35; 95% CI 2.30-2.41).LIMITATIONS This study was limited to Medicare beneficiaries in North Carolina and South Carolina, 2011-2012.
2623	Administrative claims data are limited to information required for financial reimbursement.
2624	Because we limited our study to older fee-for-service patients, our findings may not be generalizable to managed care patients and other age groups.
2625	Patients transferred to another emergency department or facility were not included in the analysis.CONCLUSION Factors predicting 30-day return to the emergency department or hospitalization suggest the potential for care transition improvement efforts to better meet patient needs, thereby potentially improving post-emergency department outcomes.
2626	Sodium salt reduction in cereal products has been one of the top health trends.
2627	During pasta-making, kansui (an alkaline salt with reduced sodium) was added at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0% (total flour weight basis) to modify semolina gluten aggregation reactions in dough production and pasta cooking.
2628	Adding 1.0% kansui enhanced pasta dough elasticity and strength, but cooking quality was changed barely.
2629	These consequences may be attributed to more polymeric glutenin incorporated in the network through thiol (SH)/disulfide (SS) exchange or other non-redox reactions/interactions by introducing kansui, which was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, FTIR, and HPLC results.
2630	The protein cross-linking induced by kansui (1.0%) improved the texture properties of pasta without compromising the cooking and coloration characteristics.
2631	Considering the process convenience and food safety of reducing sodium chloride with natural alkaline salt reagent in industrial pasta production, this could be a potential approach for sodium reduction.
2632	Behaviors, such as sleeping, foraging, and learning, are controlled by different regions of the rat brain, yet they occur rhythmically over the course of day and night.
2633	They are aligned adaptively with the day-night cycle by an endogenous circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), but local mechanisms of rhythmic control are not established.
2634	The SCN expresses a ~24-h oscillation in reduction-oxidation that modulates its own neuronal excitability.
2635	Could circadian redox oscillations control neuronal excitability elsewhere in the brain?
2636	We focused on the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus, which is known for integrating information as memories and where clock-gene expression undergoes a circadian oscillation that is in anti-phase to the SCN.
2637	Evaluating long-term imaging of endogenous redox couples and biochemical determination of glutathiolation levels, we observed oscillations with an ~24 h period that is 180° out-of-phase to the SCN.
2638	Excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons, primary hippocampal projection neurons, also exhibits a rhythm in resting membrane potential that is circadian time-dependent and opposite from that of the SCN.
2639	The reducing reagent glutathione rapidly and reversibly depolarized the resting membrane potential of CA1 neurons; the magnitude is time-of-day-dependent and, again, opposite from the SCN.
2640	These findings extend circadian redox regulation of neuronal excitability from the SCN to the hippocampus.
2641	Insights into this system contribute to understanding hippocampal circadian processes, such as learning and memory, seizure susceptibility, and memory loss with aging.

2644	The potential of a novel caesium evaporator for enhancing negative secondary ion yields during Focused Ion Beam Time-Of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (FIB-TOF-SIMS) elemental analysis is presented.
2645	The design of the lab prototype Cs evaporator is based on alkali metal dispensers containing a stable Cs salt and therefore it can be safely used for FIB-TOF-SIMS measurements under high vacuum conditions.
2646	Continuous in-situ Cs0 deposition on an Au sample surface has allowed the TOF-SIMS signal to be increased by a factor of 260, which confirms the functionality of the technique.
2647	A series of tests were conducted in positive and negative ion detection modes to study the response of the system to currents applied on Cs dispensers and generated Joule heating.
2648	A stable Cs flux (represented by a Cs+ signal measured with the TOF-SIMS) was achieved over around 1.5 h when using two Cs dispensers simultaneously.
2649	Moreover, the presence of Cs0 has enabled the stability of an enhanced Si- signal measured by the TOF-SIMS to be maintained over several hours.
2650	This time is much longer than a typical duration of FIB-TOF-SIMS depth profiling, thus the presented method exhibits the potential for studying heterogeneous and multi-layer structures in a three-dimensional space.
2651	OBJECTIVE-To identify the effects of gender and other predictors of change in the salary of academic emergency physicians over a four sequential time period of survey administration, across a sample of physicians within different emergency departments (EDs) and within states representing the four main geographical regions of the United States (US).
2652	METHODS-This was a successive cross-sectional observational study of EDs in the United States using an annual salary survey distributed to all Association of Academic Chairs in EM (AACEM) & Academy of Administrators in Academic EM (AAAEM) members in 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017 with a sample size of 7,102 respondents over all time periods.
2653	The primary variable of interest was the adjusted base salary, calculated to be the full-time effort of the physician without any enhancements (e.g.
2654	without stipend, release time, extra hours).
2655	Institutional predictive variables included: US region that ED was in, and if the site was an academic or community academic hybrid ("community") ED.
2656	Individual level variables included: gender, academic rank, years at academic rank, years at rank within the ED, and primary duty (clinical or other).
2657	A series of Wilcoxon tests were conducted to determine if the unadjusted difference in salaries by gender for each year of the survey were significantly different.
2658	The effects of relative change in adjusted base salary over time were assessed using a mixed effects regression model; with institutional and individual level predictors included in the model.
2659	RESULTS-Data were provided by 81 departments across the four geographic regions of the United States (Northeast, South, West, and Midwest).
2660	Most of the survey respondents across the four time periods of administration were male (65%) and reported primary clinical appointments at an academic ED (94%).
2661	Overall salaries increased across the four-time points of the data with an overall relative 10.8% (95%CI: 9.6; 12) change in median salary between 2013 and 2017; the relative percentage change for female respondents was 10.6% (95%CI: 9.4; 11.8), and 11.1% (95%CI: 10.2; 12) for males.
2662	Within survey years, not adjusting for academic rank, the median salary increase for males was higher ($226,746 in 2013 to $252,000 in 2017) than females ($217,000 in 2013 to $240,000 in 2017); with significance at all four-time points (Z = 6.33; p < 0.001).
2663	With a median average salary gap of $12,000 in 2017.
2664	In the predictive model that adjusted for covariates, gender significantly predicted median adjusted salary, with males earning significantly more than females (F (1) = 22.5, p < 0.001).
2665	CONCLUSIONS-Despite previously published data showing an inappropriate gender salary gap in emergency medicine, this gap has remained essentially unchanged over the past four years.

2668	Capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection (C⁴D) is an improved approach to avoid the problems of labor-intensive, time-consuming and insufficient accuracy of plate count as well as the high-cost apparatus of flow cytometry (FCM) in bacterial counting.
2669	This article describes a novel electrode-integrated printed-circuit-board (PCB)-based C⁴D device, which supports the simple and safe exchange of capillaries and improves the sensitivity and repeatability of the contactless detection.
2670	Furthermore, no syringe pump is needed in the detection, it reduces the system size, and, more importantly, avoids the effect on the bacteria due to high pressure.
2671	The recovered bacteria after C⁴D detection at excitation of 25 Vpp and 60⁻120 kHz were analyzed by flow cytometry, and a survival rate higher than 96% was given.
2672	It was verified that C⁴D detection did not influence the bacterial viability.
2673	Moreover, bacteria concentrations from 10⁶ cells/mL to 10⁸ cells/mL were measured in a linear range, and relative standard deviation (RSD) is below 0.2%.
2674	In addition, the effects on bacteria and C⁴D from background solutions were discussed.
2675	In contrast to common methods used in most laboratories, this method may provide a simple solution to in situ detection of bacterial cultures.
2676	This study analyses the two-dimensional thermo-elastic response of functionally graded carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (FG-CNTRC) cylindrical pressure vessels, by applying the third-order shear deformation theory (TSDT).
2677	The effective properties of FG-CNTRC cylindrical pressure vessels are computed for different patterns of reinforcement, according to the rule of mixture.
2678	The governing equations of the problem are derived from the principle of virtual works and are solved as a classical eigenproblem under the assumption of clamped supported boundary conditions.
2679	A large parametric investigation aims at showing the influence of some meaningful parameters on the thermo-elastic response, such as the type of pattern, the volume fraction of CNTs, and the Pasternak coefficients related to the elastic foundation.
2680	OBJECTIVE-Investigate associations between perceived parental/peer support for a healthy diet and adolescent dietary behaviors using data from the 2009-2011 School Physical Activity and Nutrition (SPAN) survey.
2681	DESIGN-A secondary analysis of SPAN, a cross-sectional statewide study using a validated self-administered questionnaire, assessed obesity-related behaviors.
2682	SETTING-Probability-based sample of Texas 8th- and 11th-grade students.
2683	PARTICIPANTS-A total of 6,716 8th- and 11th-grade students.
2684	MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES-Obtained by self-report and included sugary beverage consumption, fruit and vegetable intake, and SPAN healthy eating score.
2685	ANALYSIS-Multiple logistic regression and linear regression were used to determine associations, controlling for demographic variables.
2686	RESULTS-For every 1-point increase in parental support (range, 0-12), adolescents had 1.19 times higher odds of consuming ≥1 fruits or vegetables/d (P < .001) and 1.1 times lower odds of consuming ≥2 sugary beverages/d (P < .05), and had a SPAN healthy eating score (range, -100 to 100) that was 1.6 points higher (P < .001).
2687	For every 1-point increase in peer support, adolescents had 1.14 times higher odds of consuming ≥1 fruits and vegetables/d (P < .001) and a higher SPAN healthy eating score (P < .05).
2688	CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS-Parental/peer support was associated with healthier dietary behaviors.
2689	Future research could conduct pre-post intervention studies to determine whether an increase in parental/peer support is associated with positive changes in healthier eating.
2690	OBJECTIVE-To compare strategies for the timing of delivery in women with breast cancer and known cancer stage or hormone receptor subtype, and to determine the optimal gestational age for induction in regards to maternal-fetal outcomes.
2691	STUDY DESIGN-A decision-analytic model was designed comparing eight different strategies for scheduled delivery at 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, and 37 weeks gestation.
2692	Optimal breast cancer treatment was assumed to be delayed until after delivery.
2693	Baseline estimates of the stage- and subtype-specific mortality and the impact of delayed cancer treatment on 5-year survival rates were obtained from the literature.
2694	Outcomes factored into the model included the risk of intrauterine fetal demise, spontaneous delivery, respiratory distress syndrome, cerebral palsy, and neonatal demise at each gestational age.
2695	Univariate sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to test the robustness of our model.
2696	RESULTS-For women with stage I-II breast cancer, delivery at 36 weeks yielded the highest number of overall quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), while maternal QALYs were maximized with delivery at 34 weeks.
2697	For stage III and IV disease, maternal QALYs were maximized at 31 and 30 weeks, respectively.
2698	For women with estrogen or progesterone receptor-positive, human epidermal receptor-2 negative breast cancer, both maternal QALYs and overall QALYs were maximized with delivery at 36 weeks.
2699	More aggressive biological phenotypes were similarly associated with optimal delivery at decreasing gestational age.
2700	Our model was heavily driven by the baseline probability of maternal death within 5 years, in addition to the expected progression of disease and decreases in survival rates with each week of non-treatment, and remained robust across reasonable ranges for all variables of interest.
2701	CONCLUSIONS-For women with breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy, decisions regarding timing of delivery should take into consideration both cancer stage and hormone receptor subtype.
2702	The Global Burden of Disease Study identified cardiovascular risk factors as leading causes of global deaths and life years lost.
2703	Endothelial dysfunction represents a pathomechanism that is associated with most of these risk factors and stressors, and represents an early (subclinical) marker/predictor of atherosclerosis.
2704	Oxidative stress is a trigger of endothelial dysfunction and it is a hall-mark of cardiovascular diseases and of the risk factors/stressors that are responsible for their initiation.
2705	Endothelial function is largely based on endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) function and activity.
2706	Likewise, oxidative stress can lead to the loss of eNOS activity or even "uncoupling" of the enzyme by adverse regulation of well-defined "redox switches" in eNOS itself or up-/down-stream signaling molecules.
2707	Of note, not only eNOS function and activity in the endothelium are essential for vascular integrity and homeostasis, but also eNOS in perivascular adipose tissue plays an important role for these processes.
2708	Accordingly, eNOS protein represents an attractive therapeutic target that, so far, was not pharmacologically exploited.
2709	With our present work, we want to provide an overview on recent advances and future therapeutic strategies that could be used to target eNOS activity and function in cardiovascular (and other) diseases, including life style changes and epigenetic modulations.
2710	We highlight the redox-regulatory mechanisms in eNOS function and up- and down-stream signaling pathways (e.g., tetrahydrobiopterin metabolism and soluble guanylyl cyclase/cGMP pathway) and their potential pharmacological exploitation.
2711	Inflammation plays a critical role in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), which has been identified as a major predisposing factor for heart failure in diabetic patients.
2712	Previous studies indicated that ivabradine (a specific agent for heart rate [HR] reduction) has anti-inflammatory properties, but its role in DCM remains unknown.
2713	This study investigated whether ivabradine exerts a therapeutic effect in DCM.
2714	C57BL/6J mice were injected intraperitoneally with streptozotocin (STZ) to induce diabetes; then administered with ivabradine or saline (control).
2715	After 12 weeks, the surviving mice were analyzed to determine the cardioprotective effect of ivabradine against DCM.
2716	Although treatment with ivabradine did not affect blood glucose levels, it attenuated tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression, inhibited c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) activation, reduced histological abnormalities, myocardial apoptosis and collagen deposition, and improved cardiac function in the diabetic mice.
2717	Interestingly, the anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic properties of ivabradine, but not its inhibitory effect on JNK and p38 MAPK, were observed in high-glucose-cultured neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes.
2718	Attenuating inflammation and apoptosis via intramyocardial injection of lentiviruses carrying short hairpin RNA targeting JNK and p38 MAPK validated that the anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects of ivabradine were partly attributed to JNK and p38 MAPK inactivation in diabetic mice.
2719	In summary, these data indicate that ivabradine-mediated improvement of cardiac function in STZ-induced diabetic mice may be partly attributed to inhibition of JNK/p38 MAPK-mediated inflammation and apoptosis, which is dependent on the reduction in HR.
2720	The lactose repressor, LacI (I+YQR) is an archetypal transcription factor that has been a workhorse in many synthetic genetic networks.
2721	LacI represses gene expression (apo ligand) and is induced upon binding of the ligand isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG).
2722	Recently, laboratory evolution was used to confer inverted function in the native LacI topology resulting in anti-LacI (antilac) function (IAYQR), where IPTG binding results in gene suppression.
2723	Here we engineered 46 antilacs with alternate DNA binding function (IAADR).
2724	Phenotypically, IAADR transcription factors are the inverse of wild-type I+YQR function and possess alternate DNA recognition (ADR).
2725	This collection of bespoke IAADR bind orthogonally to disparate non-natural operator DNA sequences and suppress gene expression in the presence of IPTG.
2726	This new class of IAADR gene regulators were designed modularly via the systematic pairing of nine alternate allosteric regulatory cores with six alternate DNA binding domains that interact with complementary synthetic operator DNA sequences.
2727	The 46 IAADR identified in this study are also orthogonal to the naturally occurring operator O1.
2728	Finally, a demonstration of full orthogonality was achieved via the construction of synthetic genetic toggle switches composed of two non-synonymous unit pair operations that control two distinct fluorescent outputs.
2729	This new class of IAADR transcription factors will facilitate the expansion of the computational capacity of engineered gene circuits, via the scalable increase in the control over the number of gene outputs by way of the expansion of the number of unique transcription factors (or systems of transcription factors) that can simultaneously regulate one or more promoter(s).
2730	Vitamin deficiency is a main cause of many disorders and diseases that cannot be treated without using dietary supplements and multivitamin medications.
2731	We present here a UV-spectrophotometric method for simultaneous assay of two of the widely used vitamins, thiamine hydrochloride (vitamin B1) and pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6).
2732	The method is based on H-point standard addition to estimate the vitamins under study in their pure solutions and multivitamin ampoules by measuring the absorption of the mixture at 283 and 298 nm allowing its application in quality control laboratories.
2733	The work summarizes the theoretical basis of the H-point standard addition method.
2734	Moreover, a guide for the selection of the two wavelengths at which the calibration curves are constructed is given in this investigation.
2735	The linear ranges of the calibration graphs are 6.75-67.5 and 2.06-20.56 μg/mL for thiamine and pyridoxine, respectively.
2736	Correlation coefficients (r2) were found to be 0.9990 and 0.9899 at 283 nm and 0.9855 and 0.9995 at 298 nm for vitamin B1 and vitamin B6, respectively.
2737	Oscillator strength (f), transition dipole moment (μ) and resonance energy (RN) were calculated.
2738	The method was successfully applied for dual determination of the vitamins in their pure solutions and multivitamin ampoules with recovery values ranging from 98.41 to 102.6 and from 95.39 to 104.9% for thiamine and pyridoxine, respectively.
2739	The accuracy and precision of the proposed method is obvious from the low relative standard deviation values which are not more than 1.19%.
2740	BACKGROUND-Physical inactivity is a major risk factor for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
2741	Exercise-based prevention interventions for improving cardiorespiratory fitness are a recommended complementary treatment for NAFLD.
2742	Achievement of minimally effective physical activity to improve cardiorespiratory fitness among patients typically involves high personal and financial expenses in face-to-face settings.
2743	We designed an eHealth approach for patients with NAFLD to improve the cardiorespiratory fitness and report the first results of the HELP (Hepatic Inflammation and Physical Performance in Patients With NASH [nonalcoholic steatohepatitis]) study.
2744	OBJECTIVE-We aimed to assess the effectiveness of an 8-week, tailored, Web-based exercise intervention for cardiorespiratory fitness improvement, expressed as peak oxygen uptake (peak volume of oxygen [VO2peak]), in patients with histologically confirmed NAFLD.
2745	METHODS-In a 24-month period, 44 patients were enrolled into an 8-week, prospective, single-arm study with 12 weeks of follow-up.
2746	After a medical examination and performance diagnostics, a sports therapist introduced the patients to a Web-based platform for individualized training support.
2747	Regular individual patient feedback was provided to systematically adapt the weekly exercise schedule, which allowed us to monitor and ensure patient adherence to strength and endurance training and optimize the step-wise progressive exercise load.
2748	Exercise progression was based on an a priori algorithm that considered the subjective rate for both perceived exhaustion and general physical discomfort.
2749	The VO2peak was assessed at baseline and at the end of the study by spiroergometry.
2750	RESULTS-A total of 43 patients completed the intervention with no adverse events.
2751	The VO2peak increased significantly by 2.4 mL/kg/min (8.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.48-3.27; P<.001) accompanied by a reduction of 1.0 kg in a body weight (95% CI: 0.33-1.58; P=.004) and 1.3 kg in body fat mass (95% CI: 0.27-2.27; P=.01).
2752	In an exploratory analysis, step-wise logistic regression analysis revealed low body fat and VO2peak at baseline and the total minutes of endurance training during the intervention as main contributors to a positive change in VO2peak.
2753	Our predictive model indicated that the average patient with NAFLD needed 223 min for stabilization of VO2peak and 628 min for average improvement in VO2peak.
2754	However, in patients with a VO2peak approximately 20% higher than the average VO2peak, 628 min were only sufficient to stabilize the VO2peak and >40% reduction in the average fat mass would be required to achieve an average outcome.
2755	CONCLUSIONS-This is the first study to show that patients with NAFLD can be effectively supported by a Web-based approach, which can increase the VO2peak to a similar extent as face-to-face interventions.
2756	Patients with low body fat and low VO2peak benefited the most from our intervention.
2757	In terms of future treatment strategies, NAFLD patients with high body fat may particularly benefit from body-fat reduction through a strict nutritional intervention, subsequently enabling a more effective exercise intervention.

2760	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive accumulation of misfolded proteins, which form senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, and the release of inflammatory mediators by innate immune responses.
2761	β-Amyloid peptide (Aβ) is derived from sequential processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by membrane-bound proteases, namely the β-secretase, BACE1, and γ-secretase.
2762	Membrane trafficking plays a key role in the regulation of APP processing as both APP and the processing secretases traffic along distinct pathways.
2763	Genome wide sequencing studies have identified several AD susceptibility genes which regulate membrane trafficking events.
2764	To understand the pathogenesis of AD it is critical that the cell biology of APP and Aβ production is well defined.
2765	This review discusses recent advances in unravelling the membrane trafficking events associated with the production of Aβ, and how AD susceptible alleles may perturb the sorting and transport of APP and BACE1.
2766	Mechanisms whereby inflammation may influence APP processing are also considered.
2767	BACKGROUND-Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease of public health relevance in Brazil.
2768	To prioritize disease control measures, the Secretaria de Vigilância em Saúde of Brazil's Ministry of Health (SVS/MH) uses retrospective human case counts from VL surveillance data to inform a municipality-based risk classification.
2769	In this study, we compared the underlying VL risk, using a spatiotemporal explicit Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM), with the risk classification currently in use by the Brazil's Ministry of Health.
2770	We aim to assess how well the current risk classes capture the underlying VL risk as modelled by the BHM.
2771	METHODS-Annual counts of human VL cases and the population at risk for all Brazil's 5564 municipalities between 2004 and 2014 were used to fit a relative risk BHM.
2772	We then computed the predicted counts and exceedence risk for each municipality and classified them into four categories to allow comparison with the four risk categories by the SVS/MH.
2773	RESULTS-Municipalities identified as high-risk by the model partially agreed with the current risk classification by the SVS/MH.
2774	Our results suggest that counts of VL cases may suffice as general indicators of the underlying risk, but can underestimate risks, especially in areas with intense transmission.
2775	CONCLUSION-According to our BHM the SVS/MH risk classification underestimated the risk in several municipalities with moderate to intense VL transmission.
2776	Newly identified high-risk areas should be further evaluated to identify potential risk factors and assess the needs for additional surveillance and mitigation efforts.
2777	Office-based visits involving a buprenorphine prescription increased significantly among primary care and specialist physicians from 2006 to 2014.
2778	The growing involvement of nonpsychiatry physicians in buprenorphine prescribing has the potential to provide better access to care for people with opioid use disorders.
2779	Athecate dinoflagellate Karlodinium veneficum is a universal toxic species possessing karlotoxins recognized especially as ichthyotoxic as well as cytotoxic and hemolytic.
2780	Blooms of K. veneficum, both single-species or accompanied with other species, occurred more frequently worldwide in recent years, including the coastal region of China.
2781	Normally, K. veneficum present in relatively low abundance in phytoplankton communities in estuary regions.
2782	Being small and difficult to identify with light microscopy, it has been ignored for a long time till its blooming and toxins being confirmed.
2783	How it presents in background level and what is its relationship with critical geological and hydrological environment factors are basically not clear.
2784	In this study, the paper reports the application of a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) method to investigate the abundance and distribution of K. veneficum in the coastal waters of Xiangshan Bay in the East China Sea (ECS), a typical bay area of harmful algae blooms and heavily affected by anthropogenic activities.
2785	The real-time qPCR assay came out being an efficient method at detecting even low cell densities of K. veneficum of different genotypes.
2786	A total of 38 field samples of surface (0.5 m) and bottom water (9-100 m in depth) were analyzed and 12 samples were found positive for K. veneficum.
2787	At least 3 genotypes of K. veneficum present in this region.
2788	Temperatures in sites of K. veneficum positive ranged from 21.7 to 23.4 °C, and salinity levels were between 21.1 and 26.3.
2789	The K. veneficum distributed quite extensively in the waters of Xiangshan Bay, cell abundance varied from a low of 4 cells/L to a maximum of 170 cells/L.
2790	Most of the samples containing K. veneficum were collected from bottom water in different sites.
2791	At three of the 19 sampling sites, K. veneficum was detected in both surface and bottom water samples.
2792	Especially at sampling site near Beilun port, where the water is typically muddy with low transparency, relative high cell numbers of K. veneficum were found in both surface and bottom waters.
2793	Mixotrophy and vertical migration of K. veneficum could be important eco-physiological factors to consider in terms of understanding these distribution characteristics.
2794	The ideal conditions for K. veneficum growth and aggregation in this area still needs further study.
2795	Early pregnancy loss (EPL) between days 15-65 after breeding has been shown to occur in 7.9% of equine pregnancies with substantial economical, welfare and safety implications.
2796	Whilst maternal age has been recognised as an important risk factor in relation to the incidence of EPL, few other risk factors have been conclusively identified.
2797	Further, multivariable data analysis of risk factors for EPL is sparse.
2798	A prospective cohort investigation of thoroughbred broodmares in the United Kingdom was conducted over the 2013 and 2014 breeding seasons.
2799	Information relating to 28 factors including mare, stallion, pregnancy and therapeutic interventions was collected using questionnaires and entered into a custom-designed Microsoft Access database.
2800	Mixed effects logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for EPL, including 'mare' as a random effect to account for repeat pregnancies in the same mare.
2801	Stallion, stud and veterinarian were also evaluated as random effects.
2802	Variables with a p-value of <0.25 in univariable analysis were taken forward for consideration in the multivariable model which was built using a forward stepwise approach.
2803	Data were collected on 2245 pregnancies in 1753 mares.
2804	Increasing mare age (OR = 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04, 1.18, p = 0.001), having had one previous foal (OR = 3.52, 95% CI = 1.56, 7.95, p = 0.002) and presence of uterine cysts (OR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.07, 2.91, p = 0.03) were all associated with increased odds of EPL following multivariable analysis.
2805	Increasing day 15/16 scan vesicle size (OR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.16, 0.38, p < 0.001) and the use of ovulatory induction agents (OR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.17, 0.55, p < 0.001) were negatively associated with EPL.
2806	Stallion, stud and veterinarian were not significantly associated with EPL.
2807	Analysis of a subpopulation of 344 multiple (twin and triplet) pregnancies found that the use of flunixin meglumine at the time of manual reduction of a multiple pregnancy resulted in reduced odds of EPL (OR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.14, 0.84, p = 0.02).
2808	Results from this study can be used by stud farm personnel when assessing their broodmare population and by clinicians when deciding upon therapeutic strategies.
2809	Additional work can be focused around these risk factors to further our understanding of the pathophysiology of EPL.
2810	Clostridium difficile has been recovered from the faeces of several animal species as well as horses.
2811	Between April 2015 and October 2016, 213 samples of faeces from non-hospitalized (n = 138) and hospitalized horses (n = 75) were investigated and eighteen C. difficile isolates were cultured using an enrichment method.
2812	Sixteen C. difficile positive samples were identified from hospitalised horses (p˂0.01).
2813	Molecular typing revealed seven ribotypes and sequence types (RT033/ST11 n = 8, 44.4%; RT081/ST9 n = 4, 22.2%; RT009/ST3 n = 2, 11.1%; RT003/ST12 n = 1, 5.6%; RT010/ST15 n = 1, 5.6%; RT012/ST54 n = 1, 5.6%; RT039/ST26 n = 1, 5.6%).
2814	Seven identified STs clustered to two clades (1 and 5).
2815	All C. difficile isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin, metronidazole, moxifloxacin, and vancomycin.
2816	One isolate (RT039) exhibited a high level of resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin (256 mg/L) and carried the ermB, adenine methylase gene.
2817	Five isolates were resistant to clindamycin at lower minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs = 8-16 mg/L) and were susceptible to erythromycin and also ermB negative.
2818	All isolates were resistant to enrofloxacin (MICs ranged between 4 and 32 mg/L).
2819	Eight isolates were resistant to tetracycline (MICs 12-32 mg/L).
2820	Of them, four isolates carried the tetM gene and four isolates the tetW gene.
2821	In addition, the tetracycline resistance determinants identified were: tetA (P) (n = 4); tetB (P); and tetL (n = 1 each).
2822	The presence of tetW or tetM, together with other tet-class mechanisms, lead to an increase in the MICs to tetracycline.
2823	C. difficile isolates derived from Czech horses are identical to the ribotypes identified in humans and carry acquired antimicrobial resistance genes whose dissemination from veterinary healthcare sector to humans should be monitored by the "One health" approach.
2824	With the advent of Network Function Virtualization (NFV), network services that traditionally run on proprietary dedicated hardware can now be realized using Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) that are hosted on general-purpose commodity hardware.
2825	This new network paradigm offers a great flexibility to Internet service providers (ISPs) for efficiently operating their networks (collecting network statistics, enforcing management policies, etc.).
2826	However, introducing NFV requires an investment to deploy VNFs at certain network nodes (called VNF-nodes), which has to account for practical constraints such as the deployment budget and the VNF-node capacity.
2827	To that end, it is important to design a joint VNF-nodes placement and capacity allocation algorithm that can maximize the total amount of network flows that are fully processed by the VNF-nodes while respecting such practical constraints.
2828	In contrast to most prior work that often neglects either the budget constraint or the capacity constraint, we explicitly consider both of them.
2829	We prove that accounting for these constraints introduces several new challenges.
2830	Specifically, we prove that the studied problem is not only NP-hard but also non-submodular.
2831	To address these challenges, we introduce a novel relaxation method such that the objective function of the relaxed placement subproblem becomes submodular.
2832	Leveraging this useful submodular property, we propose two algorithms that achieve an approximation ratio of $\frac{1}{2}(1-1/e)$ and $\frac{1}{3}(1-1/e)$ for the original non-relaxed problem, respectively.
2833	Finally, we corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms through extensive evaluations using both trace-driven simulations and simulations based on synthesized network settings.
2834	A total internal reflection (TIR) shell capable of generating illuminating light with a wide-angle distribution from light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is proposed.
2835	The TIR shell can be used to create an LED light bulb with enclosed heat dissipaters to release the heat generated by the LEDs.
2836	The TIR shell has light-scattering areas on its inner surface and a mirror-polished free-form outer surface that can guide all rays emitted from the LEDs to the scattering areas by the TIR.
2837	The rays diffused by the light-scattering areas are emitted from the TIR shell in a wide-angle light distribution.
2838	A prototype of the LED light bulb with a metal shell for heat dissipation inside the TIR shell shows favorable features such as a half-intensity angle of 330°, lighting efficiency of 81%, and glare-free lighting emitted from the entire surface area of the TIR shell.
2839	BACKGROUND-Patients with carcinoid tumors are at risk for profound intraoperative hypotension known as carcinoid crisis, which catecholamines are traditionally believed to trigger.
2840	However, data supporting this are lacking.
2841	METHODS-Anesthesia records were retrospectively reviewed for carcinoid patients treated with vasopressors.
2842	Hemodynamics for those with crisis were compared between those who received β-adrenergic agonists (B-AA) versus those who did not.
2843	RESULTS-Among 293 consecutive operations, 58 were marked by 161 crises.
2844	There was no significant difference in the incidence of paradoxical hypotension with B-AA compared to non-B-AA (p = 0.242).
2845	The maximum percent decrease in mean arterial pressure following drug administration was significantly greater in those patients treated with non-B-AA than with B-AA (31.6% vs. 12.5%, p < 0.0001).
2846	There were no differences in crisis duration (p = 0.257) or postoperative complication rate (p = 0.896).
2847	CONCLUSIONS-β-Adrenergic agonist use was not associated with paradoxical hypotension, prolonged carcinoid crisis, or postoperative complications in patients with intraoperative carcinoid crisis.
2848	Zika virus (ZV) is an important emerging infection.
2849	Rash is a key feature, but the summative literature lacks description of the rash beyond 'maculopapular'.
2850	Our aim was to identify the cutaneous features described in the published literature.
2851	A literature search using defined terms for ZV cases reports and series was performed on the OVID, Clinical Key and University of Dundee's e-library journals databases in December 2016; a later case report was included while the paper was under review.
2852	Diagnosis in all cases was via PCR.
2853	Exclusion criteria were Zika cases without rash or omitting any description of the rash.
2854	Ocular features (conjunctivitis) were not included.
2855	In total, 42 publications with 66 cases met the criteria.
2856	The most frequent descriptive features included maculopapular (59%), lower limb petechial purpura (11%) and erythematous/red (9%).
2857	Pruritus was described in 44% and tenderness in 3%.
2858	Lesions were located on the trunk (29%), limbs (5% arms, 11% both arms and legs), face (17%) and extremities (14%) or were diffuse/generalized (12%).
2859	There was facial sparing in 3%.
2860	Other features were centrifugal spread (6%), palmar and/or plantar involvement (6%), palmoplantar desquamation (2%) and malar erythema with oedema (2%).
2861	Mucosal features included gingival bleeding (11%), oral haemorrhagic blisters (8%) and painful blisters/vesicles (4%).
2862	Oedema/swelling was described in the upper limbs (5%), lower limbs (5%) and both (3%).
2863	Mean rash duration was 6 days (range 3-11 days).
2864	The ZV exanthema is most frequently maculopapular, pruritic, sometimes with centrifugal spread from the trunk to extremities.
2865	This may include lower limb petechial purpura, palmoplantar lesions, oedema of limb extremities, and gingival bleeding or painful oral bullae.
2866	As ZV becomes more prevalent, recognition of the clinical features will enable earlier diagnosis and appropriate testing.
2867	Galectin-9 is the most potent inducer of cell death in lymphomas and other malignant cell types among the members of the galectin family.
2868	We investigated the mechanism of galectin-9-induced cell death in PC-3 prostate cancer cells in comparison with in Jurkat T cells.
2869	Galectin-9 induced apoptotic cell death in Jurkat cells, as typically revealed by DNA ladder formation.
2870	On the other hand, DNA ladder formation and other features of apoptosis were not apparent in PC-3 cells undergoing galectin-9-induced death.
2871	Exogenous galectin-9 was endocytosed and destined to the lysosomal compartment in PC-3 cells.
2872	The internalized galectin-9 was resistant to detergent solubilization but was solubilized with lactose.
2873	Agents inhibiting actin filament dynamics abolished the internalization and cytocidal effect of galectin-9 in PC-3 but not Jurkat cells.
2874	Galectin-9 induced accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, possibly heterogeneously ubiquitinated and/or monoubiquitinated proteins, in PC-3 cells.
2875	PYR-41, an inhibitor of the ubiquitin-activating E1 enzyme, suppressed the cytocidal effect of galectin-9.
2876	Although ubiquitination was upregulated also in Jurkat cells by galectin-9, PYR-41 was ineffective against galectin-9-induced cell death.
2877	Colocalization of ubiquitinated proteins and LAMP-1 was detectable in PC-3 cells treated with galectin-9.
2878	The ubiquitinated proteins were recovered in the insoluble fraction upon cell fractionation.
2879	In contrast, ubiquitinated proteins that accumulated after treatment with proteasome inhibitors did not co-localize with LAMP-1 and were mainly recovered in soluble fraction.
2880	The results suggest that atypical ubiquitination and accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in lysosomes play a pivotal role in galectin-9-induced non-apoptotic death in PC-3 cells.
2881	Predicting lead close rates is one of the most problematic tasks in the lead generation industry.
2882	In most cases, the only available data on the prospect is the self-reported information inputted by the user on the lead form and a few other data points publicly available through social media and search engine usage.
2883	All the major market niches for lead generation [1], such as insurance, health&medical and real estate, deal with life-altering decision making that no amount of data will be ever be able to describe or predict.
2884	This paper illustrates how character-level, deep long short-term memory networks can be applied to raw user inputs to help predict close rates.
2885	The output of the model is then used as an additional, highly predictive feature to significantly boost performance of lead scoring models.
2886	The histogenesis of extraocular sebaceous carcinomas is - in contrast to ocular sebaceous carcinomas - unclear, and information about the exact cellular architecture of these lesions and even of the normal sebaceous gland is still scarce.
2887	This study attempts to elucidate the histogenesis of sebaceous tumors, using multicolor immunofluorescence stainings to analyze 21 cases of sebaceous tumors (six each of extraocular sebaceous carcinoma, sebaceous adenoma and sebaceoma, and three cases of steatocystomas) and eight cases of normal sebaceous glands for p63, several keratins, androgen receptor, adipophilin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and Ki-67.
2888	The data of this observational study provide evidence for the existence of two subpopulations of progenitors in normal sebaceous glands: (i) p63+ K5+ progenitors which generate the K10+ luminal cells of sebaceous ducts; and (ii) p63+ K5+ K7+ progenitors which finally generate K7+ adipophilin+ EMA+ sebocytes.
2889	Without exception, all types of sebaceous tumors contained p63+ K5+ cells.
2890	Furthermore, these tumors showed a cellular hierarchy and differentiation to adipophilin+ and/or EMA+ mature sebocytes and to K10+ ductal cells through intermediary cells.
2891	Notably, a considerable number of sebaceous tumors lack the K7 pathway of cell maintenance in the normal sebaceous lobule.
2892	Based on our data, we propose a cellular algorithmic model of the hierarchy of normal sebaceous glands and of sebocytic tumors in which p63+ K5+ cells play a major role.
2893	Ferroelectricity in the ultra-low thin films of the ferroelectric materials is a rare phenomenon due to the depolarization electric field established by the uncompensated surface charge.
2894	Using density functional theory based calculations, we design buckled honeycomb binary monolayer MoC, WC, WS, and WSe.
2895	The feasibility of their experimental synthesis is evident from their low formation energies, stable lattice vibrations, and high elastic stiffnesses.
2896	The difference in electronegativity of the building atoms and lack of inversion symmetry results in high spontaneous out-of-plane polarization whereas all the in-plane components cancel out.
2897	The existence of the mirror plane along the armchair direction vanishes the in-plane piezoelectric stress effects for a strain applied along the zigzag direction.
2898	However, a strain along the armchair direction on MoC and WC results in a high piezoelectric coefficient up to 10 [Formula: see text] 10[Formula: see text] C m[Formula: see text], about three times larger than that reported for monolayer MoS[Formula: see text].
2899	The polarization switching barriers for the out-of-plane components range from 0.55 to 2.70 eV per formula unit.
2900	This paper investigates the application of supervisory control of discrete event system (SCDES) to the management and control of a custom power park (CPP).
2901	The heterogeneous nature of upcoming devices and equipment in CPP require advanced control methods to ensure the integrity and reliability under different operational states.
2902	A solution to achieve appropriate controllability, while avoiding complexity, is to sub-divide the control problem based on event-triggered dynamics where the occurrence of specific events could change the state of the system.
2903	This idea is employed to formulate the problem of coordination of the devices in a CPP and develop a systematic method to design a supervisory control based on the theory of SCDES.
2904	Three modular supervisors are synthesized using the TCT software and simulated using the Simulink.
2905	The proposed methodology could be applied to several control problems in microgrids.
2906	Substrate pleiotropicity, a very acidic phosphorylation consensus sequence, and an apparent uncontrolled activity, are the main features of CK2, a Ser/Thr protein kinase that is required for a plethora of cell functions.
2907	Not surprisingly, CK2 appears to affect cytoskeletal structures and correlated functions such as cell shape, mechanical integrity, cell movement and division.
2908	This review outlines our current knowledge of how CK2 regulates cytoskeletal structures, and discusses involved pathways and molecular mechanisms.
2909	The length of the air gap in a negative corona discharge, which affects many corresponding parameters in the discharge process, is of vital importance for the physical investigations.
2910	A hydrodynamic drift–diffusion approximation model considering photoionization utilizing the finite-element method has been used in needle-to-plane air gaps.
2911	Trichel pulses, pulse frequency, electron, and electric field distribution, and surface current density distribution on the anode plate were presented to study the effect of the gap length.
2912	An approximate exponential relationship was found to exist between the corona current and the gap length, and also a linear function was found between the pulse frequency and the gap length.
2913	The analysis shows that the characteristics of the Trichel pulse are strongly dominated by the length of the air gap.
2914	Signal divergence is an important process underpinning the diversification of lineages.
2915	Research has shown that signal divergence is greatest in species pairs that possess high geographic range overlap.
2916	However, the influence of range-size differences within pairs is less understood.
2917	We investigated how these factors have shaped signal divergence within brightly coloured coral reef butterflyfishes (genus: Chaetodon).
2918	Using a novel digital imaging methodology, we quantified both colouration and pattern using 250 000 sample points on each fish image.
2919	Surprisingly, evolutionary age did not affect colour pattern dissimilarity between species pairs, with average differences arising in just 300 000 years.
2920	However, the effect of range overlap and range symmetry was significant.
2921	Species-pair colour patterns become more different with increasing overlap, but only when ranges are similar in size.
2922	When ranges differ markedly in area, species-pair colour patterns become more similar with increasing overlap.
2923	This suggests that species with small ranges may maintain non-colour-based species boundaries.
2924	The use of collaboration while in dental school can help prepare dental students for the team-oriented nature of the workforce.
2925	One way to do this is via collaborative group testing (CGT), a method of assessment allowing students to learn from one another.
2926	The aim of this study was to examine the CGT method in a predoctoral dental education setting to determine if student examination performance improved with the addition of collaboration and if collaborative testing was beneficial to students' learning process.
2927	In 2016, all first-year dental students (n=76) at one U.S. dental school were assessed in an introductory comprehensive care course using a two-stage CGT in which students were assessed individually, prior to taking the same test in collaboration with an assigned partner.
2928	Three quizzes and a final examination were given in which student participants served as both control (individual assessments) and treatment (collaborative assessment).
2929	At the conclusion of the course, a questionnaire was administered to ascertain student perspectives.
2930	All assessments yielded favorable results with an overall score improvement from a mean of 81.1% on individual assessments to 91% on collaborative assessments (p=0.001), indicating that collaboration improved assessment outcomes.
2931	Additionally, retention of material was suggested with individual scores on the cumulative final surpassing average individual scores of the preceding quizzes (p<0.001).
2932	Students' responses on the questionnaire indicated that they perceived implementation of CGT was beneficial to their learning process.
2933	With these results, this testing methodology shows promise to enhance dental student learning, material retention, and teamwork.
2934	Splenectomy together with colectomy is most commonly performed as a result of iatrogenic injury and not as an additional elective procedure.
2935	A 50-year-old African American female presented with recurrent episodes of diverticulitis.
2936	She had mediastinal, and porta hepatis lymphadenopathy and subcutaneous nodules, but multiple biopsies were unable to establish the diagnosis.
2937	On computed tomography scan, innumerable hypodense splenic lesions were noted.
2938	The patient underwent combined laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy and splenectomy.
2939	First, the severely inflamed sigmoid colon was mobilised followed by descending colon and splenic flexure.
2940	The spleen, which showed multiple granulomas, was dissected out and the hilum secured with a stapler.
2941	The rectum was now stapled, the Pfannenstiel incision was reopened, the spleen was removed in a retrieval bag and the colon was pulled out.
2942	The colorectal anastomosis was created with an end-to-end anastomotic (circular) stapler.
2943	Pathology demonstrated multiple non-caseating granulomas indicative for sarcoidosis and acute/chronic diverticulitis.
2944	The patient developed a superficial surgical site infection but no other complications.
2945	Prednisone and methotrexate were started and her sarcoidosis improved.
2946	She was well at her 2 years of follow-up.
2947	Only few patients have an indication for elective splenectomy together with segmental colectomy.
2948	The procedure can be safely performed using a laparoscopic approach.
2949	The rapid acceleration of microbial genome sequencing increases opportunities to understand bacterial gene function.
2950	Unfortunately, only a small proportion of genes have been studied.
2951	Recently, TnSeq has been proposed as a cost-effective, highly reliable approach to predict gene functions as a response to changes in a cell’s fitness before-after genomic changes.
2952	However, major questions remain about how to best determine whether an observed quantitative change in fitness represents a meaningful change.
2953	To address the limitation, we develop a Gaussian mixture model framework for classifying gene function from TnSeq experiments.
2954	In order to implement the mixture model, we present the Expectation-Maximization algorithm and a hierarchical Bayesian model sampled using Stan’s Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo sampler.
2955	We compare these implementations against the frequentist method used in current TnSeq literature.
2956	From simulations and real data produced by E.coli TnSeq experiments, we show that the Bayesian implementation of the Gaussian mixture framework provides the most consistent classification results.
2957	Accurate quantification of noise exposure in military environments is challenging due to movement of listeners and noise sources, spectral and temporal noise characteristics, and varied use of hearing protection.
2958	This study evaluates a wearable recording device designed to measure on-body and in-ear noise exposure, specifically in an environment with significant impulse noise resulting from firearms.
2959	A commercial audio recorder was augmented to obtain simultaneous measurements inside the ear canal behind an integrated hearing protector, and near the outer ear.
2960	Validation measurements, conducted with an acoustic test fixture and shock tube, indicated high impulse peak insertion loss with a proper fit of the integrated hearing protector.
2961	The recording devices were worn by five subjects during a live-fire data collection at Marine Corps Base Quantico where Marines fired semi-automatic rifles.
2962	The field test demonstrated the successful measurement of high-level impulse waveforms with the on-body and in-ear recording system.
2963	Dual channels allowed for instantaneous fit estimates for the hearing protection component, and the device worked as intended in terms of hearing protection and noise dosimetry.
2964	Accurate measurements of noise exposure and hearing protector fit should improve the ability to model and assess the risks of noise-induced hearing loss.
2965	Understanding real-world event participation behavior has been a subject of active research and can offer valuable insights for event-related recommendation and advertisement.
2966	The emergence of event-based social networks (EBSNs), which attracts online users to host/attend offline events, has enabled exciting new research in this domain.
2967	However, most existing works focus on understanding or predicting individual users’ event participation behavior or recommending events to individual users.
2968	Few studies have addressed the problem of event popularity from the event organizer’s point of view.
2969	In this work, we study the latent factors for determining event popularity using large-scale datasets collected from the popular Meetup.com EBSN in five major cities around the world.
2970	We analyze and model four contextual factors: spatial factor using location convenience, quality, popularity density, and competitiveness; group factor using group member entropy and loyalty; temporal factor using temporal preference and weekly event patterns; and semantic factor using readability, sentiment, part of speech, and text novelty.
2971	In addition, we have developed a group-based social influence propagation network to model group-specific influences on events.
2972	By combining the COntextual features and Social Influence NEtwork, our integrated prediction framework COSINE can capture the diverse influential factors of event participation and can be used by event organizers to predict/improve the popularity of their events.
2973	Detailed evaluations demonstrate that our COSINE framework achieves high accuracy for event popularity prediction in all five cities with diverse cultures and user event behaviors.
2974	The acute renal failure is common in the hospitalized patients with the incidence is increasing.
2975	This results from the aging of the population and the widespread use of nephrotoxic therapies or diagnostic techniques.
2976	The acute renal failure is associated with an increased length of stay in hospital and the short and long-term mortality.
2977	The most common histological injury is the acute tubular necrosis.
2978	Although the most of acute renal failure is recovering, recent works have shown that there is a strong association between an acute renal failure and the increased risk of developing a chronic kidney disease.
2979	Senescent cells secrete diverse array of proteins.
2980	One group of proteins, damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) proteins exhibit relocalization from inside to outside the cell.
2981	High Mobility Group Box 1 protein (HMGB1) is the founding DAMP member.
2982	HMGB1 relocalization from the nucleus provides a molecular signature during senescence.
2983	We provide distinct molecular techniques (immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot assays) to assess HMGB1 relocalization during the initial stages of senescence.
2984	N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of HIV-1 RNA regulates viral replication and protein expression.
2985	The m6A modification is regulated by two groups of cellular proteins, named writers and erasers that add or remove m6A, respectively.
2986	HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T-cells increases m6A levels of cellular mRNA, but the underlying mechanism is unknown.Here, we show that HIV-1 infection of CD4+ primary T-cells or Jurkat cells significantly increases m6A levels of cellular RNA independently of viral replication.
2987	Compared with HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells, similar m6A up-regulation was detected in total RNA from HIV-1-infected cells treated with a reverse transcriptase inhibitor or with heat-inactivated HIV-1.
2988	Compared with mock controls, significantly increased m6A levels were detected in total RNA from Jurkat cells infected by single-cycle HIV-1 pseudotyped with an HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env), but not with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G (VSV-G).
2989	Over-expression of HIV-1 Env in HEK293T cells did not affect m6A levels of cellular RNA, suggesting that de novosynthesis of Env is not required for m6A up-regulation.
2990	Interestingly, treatment of Jurkat cells with recombinant gp120 of HIV-1 Env significantly increased m6A levels of cellular RNA, which was reduced by a gp120-neutralizing antibody.
2991	Pre-incubation of Jurkat cells with a CD4 receptor-neutralizing antibody blocked HIV-1-induced up-regulation of m6A levels in cellular RNA.
2992	Moreover, HIV-1 infection or gp120 treatment did not alter the protein expression of m6A writers and erasers in cells.
2993	Our findings suggest that HIV-1 gp120 binding to the CD4 receptor is required for m6A up-regulation in cells.
2994	OBJECTIVE-About 14% of cancer patients live with dependent children.
2995	Healthcare professionals are well placed to help patients support their children as part of a patient-centred practice.
2996	Children tend to appreciate open communication during the course of illness, but patients often find this difficult.
2997	However, research is unclear about patients' preferences and their willingness to talk with healthcare professionals about their dependent children.
2998	METHODS-We conducted 15 in-depth interviews with patients from haematological (N = 11) and gynaecological oncology (N = 4).
2999	The interviews and subsequent analysis focused on patients' communicative preferences, taking the theoretical framework of "biographical disruption" as a starting point and using Jenkins' concept of identity as a social, relational and dynamic process.
3000	RESULTS-We identified two overall identities at stake for seriously ill patients with parental responsibility: "patient identity" and "parent identity."
3001	As "patients," patients were ambivalent about relating to their children, but as "parents" they wanted healthcare professionals to talk about their children.
3002	CONCLUSION-In order to be patient-centred, clinicians should, we suggest, acknowledge that patients have these conflicting perspectives and identities, which surface at various times and situations throughout their illness trajectories.
3003	Research is needed to further explore these findings in different illness groups and cultures.
3004	We study collaborative machine learning at the wireless edge, where power and bandwidth-limited devices (workers), with limited local datasets, implement distributed stochastic gradient descent (DSGD) over-the-air with the help of a parameter server (PS).
3005	Standard approaches inherently assume separate computation and communication, where local gradient estimates are compressed and communicated to the PS over the wireless multiple access channel (MAC).
3006	Following this digital approach, we introduce D-DSGD, assuming that the workers operate on the boundary of the MAC capacity region at each iteration of the DSGD algorithm, and employ gradient quantization and error accumulation to transmit their gradient estimates within the bit budget allowed by the employed power allocation.
3007	We then introduce an analog scheme, called A-DSGD, motivated by the additive nature of the wireless MAC.
3008	In A-DSGD, the workers first sparsify their gradient estimates (with error accumulation), and then project them to a lower dimensional space imposed by the available channel bandwidth.
3009	These projections are transmitted directly over the MAC without employing any digital code.
3010	Numerical results show that A-DSGD converges much faster than D-DSGD thanks to its more efficient use of the limited bandwidth and the natural alignment of the gradient estimates over the MAC.
3011	The improvement is particularly compelling at low power and low bandwidth regimes.
3012	We also observe that the performance of A-DSGD improves with the number of workers, while D-DSGD deteriorates, limiting the ability of the latter in harnessing the computation power of too many edge devices.
3013	We highlight that the lack of quantization and channel encoding/decoding operations in A-DSGD further speeds up communication, making it very attractive for low-latency machine learning applications at the wireless network edge.
3014	Reliability enhancement is a major motivation for integrating electric and gas energy distribution systems.
3015	Compared with reliability assessment at the stage of planning, which emphasizes calculating the system annual average indices, the coupling of gas and electric energy flows contributes more to the operational reliability of the integrated system, especially during peak-load periods.
3016	In this paper, a method is proposed that assesses system outage risk in each time period by modeling the consequence of the worst N-1 fault in the integrated electric-gas system.
3017	In order to accurately model the load transfer process, a novel dynamic load restoration model is applied to minimize load loss of the system, where the fluctuation of multiple energy flows during fault clearing periods is considered.
3018	The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by performing case studies.
3019	OBJECTIVE- The aim of the present study was to perform a comprehensive review of the literature to provide a complete and clear picture of isthmocele-a hypoechoic area within the myometrium at the site of the uterine scar of a previous cesarean section-by exploring in depth every aspect of this condition.
3020	METHODS- A comprehensive review of the literature was performed to identify the most relevant studies about this topic.
3021	RESULTS- Every aspect of isthmocele has been studied and described: pathophysiology, clinical symptoms, classification, and diagnosis.
3022	Its treatment, both medical and surgical, has also been reported according to the actual literature data.
3023	CONCLUSION- Cesarean section is the most common surgical procedure performed worldwide, and one of the consequences of this technique is isthmocele.
3024	A single and systematic classification of isthmocele is needed to improve its diagnosis and management.
3025	Further studies should be performed to better understand its pathogenesis.
3026	The objective of the current study was to develop a population pharmacokinetics (PK) model for erythropoietin (Epo) in premature infants and healthy adults to characterize the variation in PK, and to study the differences in Epo PK in these 2 populations.
3027	Thirteen very low-birth-weight premature infants (<1500 g at birth), and 10 healthy adults received up to 4 intravenous doses of Epo that ranged from 10 to 500 U/kg.
3028	The final model had a target-mediated saturable, nonlinear, elimination pathway that incorporated the mechanism of Epo binding to its receptors along with a parallel linear, central elimination pathway.
3029	Epo clearance was found to be significantly higher in preterm infants compared to adults.
3030	Epo clearance via the nonlinear pathway was found to be much higher in infants; they had an Epo receptor capacity of 133 pM vs 86.6 pM in adults, which is most likely due to the higher erythroid progenitor cell mass per kilogram of body weight in infants.
3031	The parallel linear elimination was found to be more dominant in adults, reaching 91% of the total clearance with a 500-U/kg dose compared to just 6.1% of the total clearance following the same dose in preterm infants.
3032	Thus, this mechanism-based population PK model revealed that receptor-based nonlinear elimination is the dominant Epo elimination pathway in premature infants, and parallel linear elimination is dominant in adults.
3033	The integration of patient/person generated health data into clinical applications is a key strategic priority internationally.
3034	However, despite agreement on the overall direction of travel, there are still a range of challenges that inhibit progress in this area.
3035	These include technology-related factors (such as interoperability), use-related factors (such as data overload) and characteristics of the strategic environment (such as existing standards).
3036	Building on important policy deliberations from the United States that aim to navigate these challenges, we here apply emerging policy frameworks to the United Kingdom and outline five key priority areas that are intended to help policy makers make important strategic decisions in attempting to integrate patient/person generated data into electronic health records.
3037	Since the late 1990s social enterprises have been increasingly utilised as a means of delivering of health and social care services.
3038	However, there is little evidence on if, and how, provision by social enterprise might achieve positive health outcomes, particularly in comparison to other modes of delivery.
3039	In this paper, we draw upon the multiple perspectives offered by stakeholders involved in a rural social enterprise initiative based in Scotland, UK, and in a nearby comparator public sector organisation.
3040	Both types of organisation aim to increase the physical activity levels of people with chronic health conditions.
3041	In order to gain perspectives on the range of mechanisms and outcomes involved in different types of organisation providing similar interventions, realist evaluation of data gathered from in-depth semi-structured interviews (n = 68) was undertaken.
3042	Interviews were carried out with beneficiaries, service providers and external stakeholders and Context-Mechanism-Outcome (CMO) configurations developed to support our explanations for how, and in what ways, social enterprise might impact differently on health.
3043	Our findings highlight that the social enterprise is differentiated from the publicly-run service in two distinct ways: firstly, the social enterprise was better able to flexibly deliver a bespoke programme designed around the needs of service users; and secondly, their role as a community 'boundary spanner' helped facilitate strong ties and feelings of connectedness between beneficiaries, organisational staff and community stakeholders.
3044	However, these advantages were significantly compromised when funding was constrained.
3045	Our findings serve as an important basis for future research to better understand the means by which social enterprises might deliver health outcomes, particularly in comparison with public sector providers.
3046	OBJECTIVES-Validation of acute morbidity as a novel outcome in emergency medicine.
3047	METHODS-Construct validity of acute morbidity was established by comparison to other outcomes using linear and logistic regression models.
3048	RESULTS-Data of 4608 patients were analysed.
3049	1869 patients (40.6%) fulfilled the criteria for acute morbidity.
3050	Using multivariate analyses, acute morbidity was associated with outcomes such as hospitalisation (OR: 11, 95%-CI 9-13), mortality (OR 15, 95%-CI 6-49), and ICU admission (OR: 46, 95%-CI 25-96).
3051	Reliability of the construct "acute morbidity" was estimated using Cohens Kappa, which was 0.96 for intra-rater and 0.94 for inter-rater reliability.
3052	CONCLUSION-Reliability of the framework for acute morbidity was high.
3053	Construct validity was shown by associations with hospitalisation, mortality, and ICU admission.
3054	Context-Bariatric surgery results in reduced muscle mass as weight is lost, but postoperative changes in muscle strength and performance are incompletely understood.
3055	Objective-To examine changes in body composition, strength, physical activity, and physical performance 12 months following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB).
3056	Design, Participants, Outcomes-In a prospective cohort of 47 obese adults (37 women, 10 men) aged 45 ± 12 years (mean ±SD) and BMI 44 ± 8 kg/m2, we measured body composition by DXA, handgrip strength, physical activity and physical performance (chair stand time, gait speed, 400-meter walk time) before and 6 and 12 months after RYGB.
3057	Relative strength was calculated as absolute handgrip strength divided by BMI and also as absolute strength divided by appendicular lean mass.
3058	Results-Participants experienced substantial 12-month decreases in total body weight (-37 ± 10 kg or 30 ± 7%), fat mass (-48 ± 12% of baseline), and total lean mass (-13 ± 6%).
3059	Mean absolute grip strength declined by 9 ± 17% (p<0.01).
3060	In contrast, relative muscle strength increased by 32 ± 25% (strength/BMI) and 9 ± 20% (strength/ALM) (p<0.01 for both).
3061	There were statistically and clinically significant postoperative improvements in all physical performance measures, including mean improvement in gait speed of >0.1 m/s (p<0.01), and decrease in 400-m walk time of nearly a full minute (from 5.3 ± 0.7 to 4.4 ± 0.7 min, p<0.01).
3062	Conclusions-In the setting of dramatic weight loss, lean mass and absolute grip strength decline after RYGB.
3063	However, relative muscle strength and physical function improve meaningfully and are thus noteworthy positive outcomes of gastric bypass.
3064	Cyclic 3-hydroxymelatonin (C3-OHM) and N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK) are two major cascade metabolites of melatonin.
3065	We previously showed melatonin provides multiple levels of mitochondria-targeted protection beyond as a mitochondrial antioxidant during ionomycin-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ (mCa2+ ) stress in RBA1 astrocytes.
3066	Using noninvasive laser scanning fluorescence coupled time-lapse digital imaging microscopy, this study investigated whether C3-OHM and AFMK also provide mitochondrial levels of protection during ionomycin-induced mCa2+ stress in RBA1 astrocytes.
3067	Interestingly, precise temporal and spatial dynamic live mitochondrial images revealed that C3-OHM and AFMK prevented specifically mCa2+ -mediated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) formation and hence mROS-mediated depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (△Ψm ) and permanent lethal opening of the MPT (p-MPT).
3068	The antioxidative effects of AFMK, however, were less potent than that of C3-OHM.
3069	Whether C3-OHM and AFMK targeted directly the MPT was investigated under a condition of "oxidation free-Ca2+ stress" using a classic antioxidant vitamin E to remove mCa2+ -mediated mROS stress and the potential antioxidative effects of C3-OHM and AFMK.
3070	Intriguingly, two compounds still effectively postponed "oxidation free-Ca2+ stress"-mediated depolarization of △Ψm and p-MPT.
3071	Measurements using a MPT pore-specific indicator Calcein further identified that C3-OHM and AFMK, rather than inhibiting, stabilized the MPT in its transient protective opening mode (t-MPT), a critical mechanism to reduce overloaded mROS and mCa2+ .
3072	These multiple layers of mitochondrial protection provided by C3-OHM and AFMK thus crucially allow melatonin to extend its metabolic cascades of mitochondrial protection during mROS- and mCa2+ -mediated MPT-associated apoptotic stresses and may provide therapeutic benefits against astrocyte-mediated neurodegeneration in the CNS.
3073	TT-Nb2O5 nanoparticles grown on electrically conducting fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass were successfully synthesized by a facile one-pot hydrothermal method at low temperature.
3074	The as-prepared nanostructured TT-Nb2O5/FTO was directly used as the working electrode to investigate its pseudocapacitive performance without any binder or conductive agent, which exhibited a high specific capacitance of 322 F g-1 at a current density of 3.68 A g-1, excellent rate capability (258.1 F g-1 at a high scan rate of 100 mV s-1 is about 91.6% of that at 5 mV s-1), and good cycling stability (the capacitance retention is 74.3% after 3000 cycles).
3075	More importantly, it is the first time electrochemical measurements for Nb2O5 electrode in aqueous electrolyte, which are low-cost and easy to operate, have been carried out.
3076	BACKGROUND-Joint modeling of longitudinal and time-to-event data is often advantageous over separate longitudinal or time-to-event analyses as it can account for study dropout, error in longitudinally measured covariates, and correlation between longitudinal and time-to-event outcomes.
3077	The current literature on joint modeling focuses mainly on the analysis of single studies with a lack of methods available for the meta-analysis of joint data from multiple studies.
3078	METHODS-We investigate a variety of one-stage methods for the meta-analysis of joint longitudinal and time-to-event outcome data.
3079	These methods are applied to the INDANA dataset to investigate longitudinally measured systolic blood pressure, with each of time to death, time to myocardial infarction, and time to stroke.
3080	Results are compared to separate longitudinal or time-to-event meta-analyses.
3081	A simulation study is conducted to contrast separate versus joint analyses over a range of scenarios.
3082	RESULTS-The performance of the examined one-stage joint meta-analytic models varied.
3083	Models that accounted for between study heterogeneity performed better than models that ignored it.
3084	Of the examined methods to account for between study heterogeneity, under the examined association structure, fixed effect approaches appeared preferable, whereas methods involving a baseline hazard stratified by study were least time intensive.
3085	CONCLUSIONS-One-stage joint meta-analytic models that accounted for between study heterogeneity using a mix of fixed effects or a stratified baseline hazard were reliable; however, models examined that included study level random effects in the association structure were less reliable.
3086	Sensitive glycomics analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) is of great importance but significantly hampered by their low ionization efficiency and labile sialic acid moieties.
3087	Chemical derivatization offers a viable way to improve both the ionization efficiency and analytical sensitivity of the glycans in MS analysis by altering their hydrophobicity or charge property.
3088	Here we employed Girard's reagent T (GT) for on-target derivatization (GTOD) of reducing glycan under mild acid condition to form stable hydrazones at room temperature, allowing rapid and sensitive identification of neutral and sialylated glycans in positive-ion mode as only permanently positive charged molecular ions without multiple ion adducts by MALDI-TOF-MS.
3089	The MS signal intensities of lactose, sialylated N-glycans derived from bovine fetuin and neutral N-glycans derived from RNaseB and ovalbumin were boosted by 7.44, 9.13, 12.96 and 13.47 folds on average (n = 3), respectively.
3090	More importantly, after GTOD strategy, unwanted desialylation of sialylated glycans during MS was suppressed.
3091	The detection limit of the assay is desirable since the nanogram of N-glycans derived from 0.16 μg ovalbumin could be detected.
3092	The assay demonstrated good stability (RSD≤2.95%, within 10 days), reliable reproducibility (RSD = 2.96%, n = 7) and a desirable linear dynamic range from 78 nmol/mL to 10 μmol/mL.
3093	The strategy has been successfully applied to MS analysis of reducing glycans from human milks, neutral and sialylated O-, N-glycans from glycoproteins, and reducing glycans derived from glycosphingolipids, presenting neater [M]+ signals which allow detection of more low-abundance glycans and assignation of Neu5Ac vs. Neu5Gc or fucose vs. hexose in glycans due to the absence of the ambiguous interpretation from multiple peaks (ion adducts [M+Na]+ and [M+K]+).
3094	Moreover, the GTOD assay prevents desialylation during MALDI-TOF-MS profiling and enables distinct linkage-specific characterization of terminal sialic acids of N-glycans derived from human serum protein when combines with an esterification.
3095	Novel TiO2/Fe/Fe3C-biochar composite, as a heterogeneous catalyst, has been synthesized by a single-step route, where sewage sludge (SS) and different ratios of nanoparticles (NPs: Fe and Ti) impregnated with chitosan using coagulation and flocculation techniques for subsequent thermal decomposition at 800 °C.
3096	The physiochemical properties of samples have been characterized thoroughly and employed in methylene blue (MB) degradation tests.
3097	It was found that NPs ratio and chitosan support have significant influences on the properties and catalytic activity of catalysts.
3098	Chitosan inclusion successfully improves the surface area and mesoporosity of composites, while high contents of Fe integration reduce surface area and active site (Fe3C) due to Fe0 agglomeration.
3099	Though, Ti incorporation produces Ti3+ that activated photosensitivity.
3100	Catalyst with the high mesoporous surface, Ti3+, selective Fe3C, and small Fe0 shows superior MB removal competency through concurrent adsorption, photodegradation, and H2O2 activation.
3101	Primarily OH and some O2- radicles participating in the degradation reactions evident from scavenging experiments.
3102	The maximum MB removal capacity evaluated as 376.9 mg L-1 in neutral pH.
3103	Moreover, the catalyst exhibits excellent material stability, recyclability, easy separability, and low Fe-ion leaching (0.11 mg L-1) after catalysis.
3104	This study provided new insight into a low-cost and environmentally friendly route of catalyst synthesis using SS, NPs, and chitosan, which concurrently advantageous to SS disposal and wastewater treatment.
3105	Bortezomib and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) are both active regimen in AL amyloidosis.
3106	In this study, we assessed safety and efficacy of combination of bortezomib in the induction, conditioning and consolidation with ASCT in patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis.
3107	Treatment schedule consisted of two cycles of bortezomib and dexamethasone (BD) induction therapy, ASCT treatment (the conditioning regimen consisted of melphalan and bortezomib), and four additional 21-day cycles of bortezomib treatment after ASCT.
3108	Twenty-one patients were enrolled in the study.
3109	Nine patients had cardiac involvement.
3110	The overall response rate (ORR) was 90% (18/20) at 12 months after ASCT in evaluable patients, including 10 patients (50%) with complete response, 7 patients (35%) with very good partial response.
3111	The organ response rate was 72.2%.
3112	The renal and cardiac response was 55% and 40% at 12 months after ASCT respectively, and reached to 66.7% and 50% at 24 months.
3113	Peripheral neuropathy and infection were the common adverse events during the treatment, and five patients have been discontinued bortezomib for neuropathy.
3114	No death occurred in this study.
3115	After a median follow-up of 53 months, the overall survival was 100%, and the estimated progression free survival was 79.9% at 60 months.
3116	Data from this study demonstrate that incorporating bortezomib into induction, conditioning and consolidation with ASCT yielded a high rate of hematologic response with tolerable toxicity in patients with AL amyloidosis.
3117	The overall survival and progression-free survival also improved after long term follow-up in these patients.

3121	BACKGROUND-College is a critical developmental time when many emerging adults engage in unhealthy behaviors (i.e., lack of exercise, poor diet, smoking) and consequently experience an increased risk for a decline in cardiovascular health.
3122	Understanding the beliefs and opinions of the target population is important to develop effective health promotion interventions.
3123	The goal of this study was to understand opinions regarding health and health-related mobile technology of college students at an academically elite Midwestern university in order to inform a mobile health promotion intervention following the integrated behavioral model framework.
3124	METHOD-Eighteen college students between the ages of 18 and 22 participated in one of four focus groups, where they discussed perceptions of health behaviors, technology use, and their college environment.
3125	Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis as well as consensus and conformity analysis.
3126	RESULTS-Students reported prioritizing academic success over health and believed in a cultural norm within the university that unhealthy behavioral practices lead to increased academic success.
3127	Other identified barriers to achieving good health were (a) low self-efficacy for engaging in healthy behaviors when presented with conflicting academic opportunities and (b) low estimation of the importance of engaging in health behaviors.
3128	Regarding mobile health applications (apps), students reported preferring apps that were visually attractive, personalized to each user, and that did not involve competing against other users.
3129	CONCLUSION-These results have implications for the development of mobile health promotion interventions for college students, as they highlight facilitators and barriers to health behavior change in an academically elite student body.
3130	The E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin is a key effector of the removal of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy.
3131	Parkin determines cell fate in response to mitochondrial damage, with its loss promoting early onset Parkinson's disease and potentially also cancer progression.
3132	Controlling a cell's apoptotic response is essential to co-ordinate the removal of damaged mitochondria.
3133	We report that following mitochondrial damage-induced mitophagy, Parkin directly ubiquitinates the apoptotic effector protein BAK at a conserved lysine in its hydrophobic groove, a region that is crucial for BAK activation by BH3-only proteins and its homo-dimerisation during apoptosis.
3134	Ubiquitination inhibited BAK activity by impairing its activation and the formation of lethal BAK oligomers.
3135	Parkin also suppresses BAX-mediated apoptosis, but in the absence of BAX ubiquitination suggesting an indirect mechanism.
3136	In addition, we find that BAK-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation during apoptosis promotes PINK1-dependent Parkin activation.
3137	Hence, we propose that Parkin directly inhibits BAK to suppress errant apoptosis, thereby allowing the effective clearance of damaged mitochondria, but also promotes clearance of apoptotic mitochondria to limit their potential pro-inflammatory effect.
3138	Despite the established benefit of advance care planning (ACP), achieving and sustaining high rates of ACP completion continue to be a challenge in many health care settings.
3139	A palliative care champions committee has targeted improving the ACP process through quality improvement initiatives at an academic medical center.
3140	To understand the impact of multiyear efforts to improve ACP, surveys of registered nurses, care coordinators, and medical assistants from inpatient and outpatient settings were conducted in 2013 and 2017 to explore comfort level with ACP, barriers preventing completion of ACP in daily practice, and suggestions for overcoming these barriers.
3141	The findings suggest strategies to further integrate ACP through interdisciplinary teams, including outpatient staff education, inpatient and outpatient quality improvement initiatives, and dedicated staff for ACP.
3142	Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), a class of non-protein conding RNAs > 200 nt in length, were thought to play critical roles in regulating the expression of protein-coding genes.
3143	Here, we identified and characterized a novel lncRNA-000133 from the secondary hair follicle (SHF) of cashmere goat with its ceRNA network analysis, as well as, its potential effects on inductive property of dermal papilla cells were evaluated through overexpression analysis.
3144	Expression analysis indicated that lncRNA-000133 had a significantly higher expression at anagen than that at telogen in SHF of Cashmere goat, suggesting that lncRNA-000133 might be involved in the reconstruction of SHF with the formation and growth of cashmere fiber.
3145	Taken together with methylation analysis, we showed that 5' regulatory region methylation of the lncRNA-000133 gene might be involved in its expression suppression in SHF of Cashmere goat.
3146	The ceRNA regulatory network showed that a rich and complex regulatory relationship between lncRNA-000133 and related miRNAs with their target genes.
3147	The overexpression of lncRNA-000133 led to a significant increasing in the relative expression of ET-1, SCF, ALP and LEF1 in dermal papilla cells suggesting that lncRNA-000133 appears to contribute the inductive property of dermal papilla cells.
3148	After an extensive revision of the literature, we come to the following conclusions concerning the nomenclature of Southern African monkey beetles of the subtribe Pachycnemina: firstly, the current usage of the nominal subgenus Pachycnemula Schein, 1959 for a subgenus taxon different from Pachycnema s. str.
3149	Le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau Audinet-Serville, 1828 is incorrect since both names share the same type species-Melolontha crassipes Fabricius, 1775-and are therefore objective synonyms.
3150	Hence, here we invalidate Pachycnemula and establish the new nominal subgenus Macacoplia Cupello Ribeiro-Costa to denote the subgenus taxon currently known as Pachycnema (Pachycnemula).
3151	Secondly, we discuss the different spellings of the nominal genus Lepithrix Le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau Audinet-Serville, 1828, which was originally established as Lepitrix but emended to Lepithrix in 1913 by Dalla Torre.
3152	Although originally an unjustified emendation, the Lepithrix spelling is currently in prevailing usage and therefore should be deemed a justified emendation according to Article 33.2.3.1 of the current edition of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.
3153	That being so, it becomes necessary to acknowledge the homonymy between Lepithrix Le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau Audinet-Serville and its junior homonym Lepithrix Neitner, 1857, current junior synonym of Loxoncus Schmidt-Göbel, 1846 (Carabidae: Harpalinae: Harpalini: Stenolophina).
3154	Online minimization of an unknown convex function over a convex and compact set is considered under first-order stochastic bandit feedback, which returns a random realization of the gradient of the function at each query point.
3155	Without knowing the distribution of the random gradients, a learning algorithm sequentially chooses query points with the objective of minimizing regret defined as the expected cumulative loss of the function values at the query points in excess to the minimum value of the function.
3156	An active search strategy based on devising a biased random walk on an infinite-depth tree constructed through successive partitioning of the domain of the function is developed.
3157	It is shown that the biased random walk moves toward the optimal point in a geometric rate, leading to an order-optimal regret performance of $\Tilde{\O}(\sqrt T)$.
3158	The structural properties of this random-walk based strategy admits detailed finite-time regret analysis.
3159	By localizing data processing to small subsets of the input domain based on the tree structure, it enjoys $\O(1)$ computation and memory complexity per query and allows dynamic allocation of limited data storage.
3160	In this work, taking full advantage of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) mechanism, a hydroxynaphthalimide-based ratiometric two-photon fluorescent probe RTP-PN was synthesized to detect ONOO-.
3161	Probe RTP-PN could accurately detect ONOO- in the range of 1.4 nM-1.4 μM with the detection limit of 1.4 nM by a ratiometric fluorescence spectroscopy method.
3162	Additionally, probe RTP-PN exhibited an ultrafast response for ONOO- than other various species including H2O2 and ClO-.
3163	Finally, probe RTP-PN was successfully adopted to detect intracellular ONOO- by the two-photon excitation microscopy.
3164	Root-knot nematodes (RKNs; Meloidogyne spp.)
3165	are a major pest for the agriculture worldwide.
3166	RKNs induce specialized feeding cells (giant cells, GCs) inside galls which are de novo formed pseudo-organs in the roots that share similarities with other developmental processes as lateral root (LR) and callus formation or grafting involving new vascular development or pericycle proliferation.
3167	Hence, it is pertinent to study the molecular mechanisms directing the plant-nematode interaction.
3168	In this respect, ALF4 is a key gene during LR formation, vascular vessels reconnection in grafting, hormone-induced callus formation or de novo root organogenesis from leaf explants.
3169	Our results show that ALF4 is also induced in galls at early infection stages in an auxin-independent way.
3170	Furthermore, ALF4 activity is necessary for the formation of proper galls and GCs, as the mutant alf4-1 presents aberrant galls and GCs with severe structural abnormalities leading to a dramatic reduction in the nematode egg production.
3171	However, a low-reproduction rate is maintained, that might be explained by the local auxin maximum build by the nematodes in galls, partially rescuing alf4-1 phenotype.
3172	This would be similar to the partial rescue described for LR formation with exogenous auxins and also agrees with the LR emergence from alf4-1 galls but not from uninfected roots.
3173	In addition, ALF4 is also induced in syncytia formed by cyst nematodes.
3174	All these data support a pivotal role for ALF4 during de novo organogenesis processes induced by endoparasitic nematodes, in addition to its role in LR formation, callus development or vessel reconnection during grafting.
3175	BACKGROUND-We extend an interrupted time series study design to identify heterogenous treatment effects using group-based trajectory models (GBTMs) to identify groups before a new policy and then examine if the effects of the policy has consistent impacts across groups using propensity score weighting to balance individuals within trajectory groups who are and are not exposed to the policy change.
3176	We explore this by examining how adherence to endocrine therapy (ET) for women with breast cancer was impacted by reducing copayments for medications by the introduction of generic ETs among women who do not receive a subsidy (the "treatment" group) to those that do receive a subsidy and are not exposed to any changes in copayments (the "control" group).
3177	METHODS-We examined monthly adherence to ET using the proportion of days covered for women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2008 and 2009 using SEER-Medicare data.
3178	To account for baseline trends, we characterize adherence for 1 year before generic approval of ET using GBTMs, within each groups we generate inverse probability treatment weights of not receiving a subsidy.
3179	We compared adherence after generic entry within each GBTM using a modified Poisson model.
3180	RESULTS-GBTMs for adherence in the 1-year pregeneric identified 6 groups.
3181	When comparing patients who did and did not receive a subsidy we found no overall effect of generic introduction.
3182	However, 1 of the 6 identified adherence groups postgeneric adherence increased [the "consistently low" (risk ratio=1.91; 95% confidence interval=1.34-2.72)].
3183	CONCLUSIONS-This study describes a new approach to identify heterogenous effects when using an interrupted time series research design.
3184	Transmission lines (TLs) on a ground plane are one of the main radiators in printed circuit boards.
3185	This letter presents a sparse source model to predict radiation of the TLs on a ground plane.
3186	Because the current sources distribute sparsely or coherently in space, a sparse source model is developed so that the equivalent radiation sources can be reconstructed by using a small number of near-field samples scanned.
3187	Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and the advantages of the proposed method: the number of the scanned field samples can be reduced significantly in comparison with the conventional method.
3188	We present a comprehensive experimental study into the dissociative electron ionization dynamics of CF3I at energies ranging from 20 to 100 eV.
3189	A beam-gas instrument has been used to measure the absolute total ionization cross-section for the molecule over the energy range from 0 to 300 eV.
3190	Coupled with data from an electron-molecule crossed beam velocity-map imaging instrument, this allows absolute partial ionization cross-sections to be determined for formation of each ionic fragment.
3191	These reveal a number of fragmentation channels involving both C-I and C-F bond cleavage, in some cases followed by further fragmentation of the resulting molecular ion.
3192	Velocity-map images have been recorded for the I+ and CF3+ products of C-I bond cleavage and the CF2I+ products of C-F bond cleavage.
3193	Analysis of fragment kinetic energy distributions extracted from the images reveals that CF3+ product of C-I bond cleavage appears to be formed via a statistical mechanism occurring over long timescales, while the CF2I+ products of C-F cleavage are formed via a much faster, more direct dissociation mechanism involving one or more repulsive states of the parent molecular ion.
3194	The I+ fragments arising from C-I bond cleavage display behaviour intermediate between the two extremes.
3195	For all fragments, the images show little or no dependence on the energy of the incident electron, implying that the initially excited ion state or states undergo rapid relaxation to the dissociative state(s) in all cases.
3196	Only a very small fraction of the incident electron's kinetic energy is released into kinetic energy of the recoiling atomic and molecular fragments, implying that most of the available energy remains with the two departing electrons.
3197	The kinetic energy distributions obtained for the various fragments of dissociative electron ionization are compared with the corresponding distributions reported from photoionization studies in order to gain insight into the electronic states involved.
3198	BACKGROUND-Fanconi anemia is an inherited bone marrow failure disorder associated with a high incidence of leukemia and solid tumors.
3199	Currently, no interventions to prevent or delay the formation of solid tumors are available.
3200	PROCEDURE-Two of the most important hallmarks of Fanconi anemia are inflammation and oxidative stress.
3201	In this study, we administrated the antioxidant atorvastatin and the anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib to cohorts of Fancd2-/- /Trp53+/- mice, a model of Fanconi anemia.
3202	Treatment started at weaning and continued until the mice developed a palpable mass or suffered from >20% weight loss.
3203	Tumor samples and selected tissues were subjected to histopathological examination.
3204	χ2 test was performed to analyze tumor incidence, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were evaluated with log-rank test.
3205	In addition, a small cohort of mice was monitored for the safety of the drugs.
3206	RESULTS-The combined oral administration of both drugs significantly delayed tumor onset in Fancd2-/- /Trp53+/- mice.
3207	Specifically, the treatment delayed the onset of ovarian tumors in Fancd2-/- /Trp53+/- mice and increased the mean ovarian tumor-free survival time by 17%, whereas this combinatorial drug regimen did not have a significant effect on other tumor types.
3208	In addition, no detrimental effects on hematopoiesis from the drug treatment were observed during a 12-month safety monitoring.
3209	CONCLUSIONS-The data presented here suggest that a combination of atorvastatin and celecoxib may be a good candidate for chemoprevention in Fanconi anemia.
3210	TGF-β3, a subtype of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), is essential to various biological processes, including endoderm development, organogenesis, epithelial hyperplasia, synthesis of extracellular matrix, and immune response.
3211	Essentially, TGF-β3 engages the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway to stimulate mesenchymal lineage cells, inhibit epithelial or neuroectodermal lineage cells, and regulate repair, remodeling, and potential scarring after cutaneous wounding.
3212	We have now expressed recombinant human TGF-β3 in Escherichia coli Origami B (DE3), with yield 300 ± 17 mg/L monomeric protein at pilot scale.
3213	Identity was confirmed by western blot and HPLC-based peptide mapping.
3214	After purification and refolding, dimeric proteins were found to induce chondro-related genes in adipose-derived stem cells, and to suppress scarring in injured rabbit ears.
3215	Thus, the recombinant protein has excellent potential for medical applications.
3216	Human cystatin C (hCC) is a cysteine proteinase inhibitor involved in pathophysiological processes of dimerization and amyloid formation.
3217	These processes are directly associated with a number of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease or hereditary cystatin C amyloid angiopathy (HCCAA).
3218	One of the ideas on how to prevent amyloid formation is to use immunotherapy.
3219	HCC3 is one of a group of antibodies binding to hCC and reducing the in vitro formation of cystatin C dimers.
3220	Therefore, identification of the binding sites in the hCC-HCC3 complex may facilitate a search of effective drugs against HCCAA as well as understanding the mechanisms of neurodegenerative disorders.
3221	In this work we present epitope identification of the hCC-HCC3 complex using methods such as affinity chromatography, epitope excision and extraction MS approach, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX MS).
3222	Comprehensive analysis of the obtained results allowed us to identify the epitope sequence with the key fragment covering hCC L1 loop and two potential epitopic fragments - α-helical part, hCC (17-28) and β4 strand in C-terminal part of hCC.
3223	The presence of the L1 loop in the epitope sequence accounts for the significant reduction of hCC dimer formation in the presence of HCC3 antibody.
3224	SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Deciphering the mechanism of the cystatin C aggregation process and detailed analysis of the interactions between hCC, or its pathogenic variant, and monoclonal antibodies, potentially constituting aggregation inhibitors, might be of great value as there still is a complete lack of any kind of efficient therapy for young people with the pathogenic mutation of hCC.

3226	The effects of a cycling warm-up including high-intensity heavy-resistance conditioning contractions on subsequent 4-km time trial performance.
3227	J Strength Cond Res 33(1): 57-65, 2019-Previous exercise has been shown to improve subsequent performance through different mechanisms.
3228	Sport-specific conditioning contractions can be used to exploit the "post-activation potentiation" (PAP) phenomenon to enhance performance although this has rarely been investigated in short endurance events.
3229	The aim of this study was to compare a cycling warm-up with PAP-inducing conditioning contractions (CW) with a moderate-intensity warm-up (MW) on performance and physiological outcomes of a 4-km time trial.
3230	Ten well-trained male endurance cyclists ((Equation is included in full-text article.

3233	)max then 3 × 10-second at 70% of peak power interspersed with a 30-second recovery.
3234	Blood lactate concentrations were measured before and after time trial.
3235	Expired gases were analyzed along with time, power output (PO), and peak forces over each 500 m split.
3236	After CW, mean completion time was reduced (1.7 ± 3.5 seconds p > 0.05), PO increased (5.1 ± 10.5 W p > 0.05) as did peak force per pedal stroke (5.7 ± 11 N p > 0.05) when compared with MW.

3238	)increased (1.4 ± 1.6 ml·kg·min p ≤ 0.05) after CW, whereas respiratory exchange ratio (RER) decreased (0.05 ± 0.02 p ≤ 0.05).
3239	Physiological and performance differences after CW were greatest over the first 1,500 m of the trials.
3240	The results suggest that a PAP-inducing warm-up alters (Equation is included in full-text article.
3241	)kinetics and can lead to performance improvements in short endurance cycling but work and recovery durations should be optimized for each athlete.
3242	Children with obesity have a cardio-metabolic risk profile that may predispose them to cardiovascular diseases.
3243	We examined the associations between childhood body mass index (BMI) levels and changes on the risk of atrial fibrillation and flutter (AFF) in adulthood.We conducted a population-based cohort study of Danish schoolchildren aged 7-13 years born from 1930-1989.
3244	Among 314,140 children, 17,594 were diagnosed with AFF as adults.
3245	In both men and women, above-average BMIs in childhood were associated with increased risks of AFF.
3246	Children who were persistently heavy at ages 7 and 13 years, and children whose BMI increased from the internal 25th-75th percentiles or from the internal 75.1 th-90th percentiles between ages 7 and 13 years had higher risks of AFF in adulthood than children whose BMIs remained in the internal 25th-75th percentiles at both ages.
3247	A decrease in BMI percentile categories between 7 and 13 years of age reduced risks of AFF in adulthood, with risks of AFF reverting to levels similar to those in the reference group for women, but not for men.In conclusion, risks of AFF in adulthood increased with higher childhood BMIs.
3248	Remission from overweight by age 13 years reduced AFF risks, especially in women.
3249	Phototaxis usually refers to the ability of a motile micoorganism to move directionally within a light gradient, which is important for microorganisms to gain energy or avoid damage.
3250	Here, we show that an active Janus particle driven by self-thermophoresis from light heating is able to exhibit significant phototactic motion by means of mesoscale dynamics simulation.
3251	Depending on the particle-fluid interactions, the active particle can move along or against the light gradient, corresponding to positive or negative phototaxis, respectively.
3252	We find that the phototaxis of the active colloid is determined by various mechanisms, including alignment (polarization) of the particle to the light gradient, orientation-dependent motility and spatially inhomogeneous motility.
3253	Our results shed light on the phototactic behavior of artificial active colloids and open up a new possibility to design photo-responsive micromachines.
3254	Nanoscale metal-organic frameworks (NMOFs) have been applied for biomedical sensing in recent years.
3255	However, it is still a great challenge to construct high efficient NMOFs fluorescent probe for sensing in biological system, with high signal-to-noise ratio, photostability, and deep tissue penetration.
3256	Herein, for the first time, we report the two-photon metal-organic framework (TP-MOF) as a sensing platform.
3257	The design of TP-MOF is based on NMOFs incorporated a target-responsive two-photon organic moiety through click chemistry.
3258	PCN-58, as a model building block, was covalently modified with small-molecule probe for H2S or Zn2+ as model analytes.
3259	TP-MOF probes retain the fluorescence-responsive properties of the TP organic moiety and possess excellent photostability, selectivity, as well as biocompatibility.
3260	Benefitting from the modified TP fluorophore, the near-infrared (NIR) excited TP-MOF probes serve to sensing and imaging their respective targets in live cells and tissue with a deep tissue penetration up to 130 µm.
3261	The molecular design presented here bodes well for the extension to other MOFs displaying sensing components for other analytes of interest.
3262	BACKGROUND-Evidence suggests that some forms of hormonal contraception (HC) increase women's risk of non-HIV sexually transmitted infections (STIs), yet evidence has not been reviewed since 2008.
3263	We conducted an updated systematic review to incorporate studies published between January 2009 and June 2017 to examine the relationship between HCs and incident and/or recurrent STIs.
3264	METHODS-We searched PubMed and EMBASE to identify prospective studies comparing risk of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), Treponema pallidum, or Trichomonas vaginalis, between women using HC vs. non-hormonal methods or no methods.
3265	We summarize results by type of STI and HC and study quality using an adapted Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale.
3266	RESULTS-Thirty articles met the inclusion criteria.
3267	Depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) reduces the risk of trichomoniasis (consistent evidence) and may increase the risk of HSV-2 (strong effect, few studies); inconclusive evidence exists for HPV, chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis.
3268	Data on oral contraceptive pills (OCPs; generally not differentiated whether combined or progestin-only pills) suggest use is associated with a reduced risk of trichomoniasis with inconclusive findings for HSV-2, HPV, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis.
3269	Very few studies included norethisterone enanthate (Net-En) injectable, implants or the levonorgestrel IUD.
3270	CONCLUSIONS-DMPA and OCPs reduce the risk of trichomoniasis and DMPA may increase the risk of HSV-2.
3271	However, the potential for confounding cannot be ruled out.
3272	Future studies should specify the type of injectable or OCP used to increase understanding of biological pathways; more research is needed on implants and hormonal IUDs.
3273	RATIONALE-Complex pulmonary arteriovenous fistula (PAVF) is unusual, and even rarer in 2 members of a family.
3274	PAVF may not appear on chest X-ray or computed tomography imaging, especially in asymptomatic patients, and therapy is limited.
3275	Herein, PAVFs occurring in a mother and daughter are described, with the current standard methods of diagnosis and treatment of PAVF.
3276	PATIENT CONCERNS-A 34-year-old woman and her 13-year-old daughter presented with light cyanosis of the nail beds but were otherwise asymptomatic, and physical examination was unremarkable.
3277	Their arterial oxygen saturation levels were low (80-85%).
3278	DIAGNOSES-Angiography led to a diagnosis of PAVF involving the bilateral lung in both women.
3279	INTERVENTIONS-The combined use of coils with occluder (patent ductus arteriosus, or PDA) to obstruct the fistula.
3280	OUTCOMES-After interventional treatment, the patients' arterial oxygen saturation improved rapidly (90-95%).
3281	At 6-month follow-up, the patients' symptoms and oxygen saturation were normal.
3282	LESSONS-PAVF is an autosomal dominant disease.
3283	Here, the characteristics of the 2 patients were very similar.
3284	Using detachable coils and then a PDA occluder is a highly efficient method for treating complex PAVFs.
3285	The catchments of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) have experienced significant modifications in recent decades, leading to increases in sources of pollutants and declines in coastal water quality.
3286	As coastal waters of the GBR support some of the highest density green turtle (Chelonia mydas) foraging populations in the western Pacific Ocean, understanding the effects of contaminants on GBR green turtle populations is a priority.
3287	In 2012, elevated strandings of green turtles in the Upstart Bay region instigated the WWF's collaborative Rivers to Reef to Turtles (RRT) project to investigate if coastal pollutants are compromising green turtle health.
3288	Important to interpreting these investigations into toxicology and health is understanding the demographics of the green turtle populations being investigated.
3289	In three green turtle foraging grounds, Cleveland Bay (CLV), Upstart Bay (UPB) and the Howick Group of Reefs (HWK), this study explored population size, age class structure, sex ratio, growth rates, body condition and diet, as well as indices of turtle health, such as plastron barnacle loads and eye lesions.
3290	The three foraging populations had similar age class structure and adult sex ratios to other green turtle foraging populations in the GBR.
3291	Somatic growth rate was nonlinear, peaking in immature turtles, and was much slower in turtles foraging at HWK compared to the other two sites.
3292	This may have been due to differences in food source, which was supported by the observed dietary shifts between seagrass and algae in HWK turtles, compared to a consistently seagrass diet in CLV and UPB turtles.
3293	There were also small differences in body condition between sites, as well as differences in barnacle loads, eye lesions and occurrence of fibropapilloma tumors.
3294	This study provides important information on green turtle foraging ground population dynamics in the northern GBR, and context for the other papers in this special issue.
3295	In this study, a facile, one-step, and green synthetic route based on the biomineralization capability of urease has been proposed for the fabrication of gold nanoclusters (AuNCs).
3296	The prepared urease-encapsulated AuNCs (U-AuNCs) exhibited strong red fluorescence emission (λem = 630 nm) with a quantum yield as high as 17%.
3297	Interestingly, at a low concentration, the U-AuNC solution was found to be a dual-emissive system with the blue emission of the dityrosine (diTyr) residues of urease and the red emission of the embedded AuNCs.
3298	Further experiments demonstrated that p-nitrophenol (PNP) can selectively suppress the 410-nm emission of the diTyr residues of U-AuNCs without affecting the red emission of the U-AuNCs.
3299	The fluorescence quenching mechanism between U-AuNCs and PNP was systematically investigated, and the leading role of the inner filter effect (IFE) was identified.
3300	Additionally, based on the sulfatase-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl sulfate (PNPS) to release PNP, a self-referenced ratiometric detection method for sulfatase, which plays an important role in sulfur cycling, degradation of sulfated gly-cosaminoglycans and glycolipids, and extracellular remodeling of sulfated glycosaminoglycans, was developed by using dual-emissive U-AuNCs as the signal readout, in which the diTyr residues served as the probe and the AuNCs functioned as the internal reference.
3301	This IFE-based ratiometric sensing strategy showed a good linear relationship from 0.01 to 1 U/mL (R2 = 0.997) with a detection limit of 0.01 U/mL.
3302	The developed protocol was successfully used to detect sulfatase activity in human serum samples.
3303	The simplicity, rapidness, low cost, high credibility, good reproducibility, and excellent selectivity of the detection platform serve as an inspiration for further applications of fluorescent AuNCs in chemo/biosensing.
3304	WO3@MoS2 p-n heterostructure hollow tubes (HW@M tubes) with a large surface area have been prepared for the first time by a facile one-pot hydrothermal method.
3305	Notably, the HW@M tubes present an excellent photocatalytic activity ascribed to the higher separation rate of photogenerated electron and hole pairs owing to the heterostructure.
3306	OBJECTIVE To compare improvements in values for periodontal disease indices in dogs following treatment with closed root planing (CRP) alone, CRP with concurrent 8.5% doxycycline hyclate gel application, and CRP with concurrent 2% clindamycin hydrochloride reverse-polymer hydrogel application.
3307	DESIGN Randomized, blinded, controlled clinical trial.
3308	ANIMALS 34 client-owned dogs with periodontal pockets measuring 3.5 to 5.5 mm deep.
3309	PROCEDURES Dogs were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 treatments: CRP alone (n = 10) or CRP plus 8.5% doxycycline hyclate (12) or 2% clindamycin hydrochloride (12) gel applied within the periodontal pockets.
3310	Indices of periodontal disease severity were recorded before and 12 weeks after treatment, and outcomes were compared among treatment groups.
3311	RESULTS Except for gingivitis index, no significant differences were identified among the 3 treatment groups in the amount of improvement observed in values for periodontal disease indices following treatment.
3312	A minor but clinically unimportant improvement in mean gingivitis index values was identified for dogs treated with CRP plus doxycycline gel, which differed significantly from improvements in the other 2 groups.
3313	Teeth that were initially more severely affected (pocket depths, 5.0 to 5.5 mm) had the greatest amount of improvement, whereas teeth with only mildly high initial pocket depths (3.5 to 4.0 mm) had less improvement.
3314	CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Overall, addition of doxycycline or clindamycin gel application to CRP for the treatment of periodontal disease in dogs yielded no clinically relevant benefit over CRP during the 12-week follow-up period.
3315	Joint resource allocation involving optimization of subcarrier allocation, subcarrier pairing (SCP), and power allocation in a cooperative secure orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) communication system with untrusted users is considered.
3316	Both amplify and forward (AF), and decode and forward (DF) modes of operations are considered with individual power budget constraints for source and relay.
3317	After finding optimal subcarrier allocation for an AF relayed system, we prove the joint power allocation as a generalized convex problem, and solve it optimally.
3318	Compared to the conventional channel gain matching view, the optimal SCP is emphasized as a novel concept of channel gain tailoring.
3319	We prove that the optimal SCP pairs subcarriers such that the variance among the effective channel gains is minimized.
3320	For a DF relayed system, we show that depending on the power budgets of source and relay, SCP can either be in a subordinate role where it improves the energy efficiency, or in a main role where it improves the spectral efficiency of the system.
3321	In an AF relayed system we confirm that SCP plays a crucial role, and improves the spectral efficiency of the system.
3322	The channel gain tailoring property of SCP, various roles of SCP in improving the spectral and the energy efficiency of a cooperative communication system are validated with the help of simulation results.
3323	A novel nickel(ii) complex, [Ni(2,2'-bpy)3](H2SBTC)(H2O)5 (1) (2,2'-bpy = 2,2'-bipyridyl), was synthesized based on [Ni(2,2'-bpy)3]2+ discrete units and a partially deprotonated sulfonate-carboxylate ligand of H4SBTC (5-sulfonyl-1,2,4-benzentricarboxylic acid).
3324	The adjacent [Ni(2,2'-bpy)3]2+ cationic units were connected to H2SBTC2- anions by hydrogen bonds to form a one-dimensional (1-D) chain.
3325	The 1-D chains were further linked using hydrogen bonds from free water molecules and H2SBTC2- anions to generate a two-dimensional (2-D) plane structure.
3326	The proton conductivity of 1 reaches 1.3 × 10-4 S cm-1 at 318 K, 98% RH.
3327	Furthermore, hybrid membranes composed of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and 1 as fillers were prepared with different mass percentages.
3328	The proton conductivity of 1@PVA-5 was found to be 1.6 × 10-3 S cm-1 at 313 K and 98% RH.
3329	The large number of alcoholic hydroxyl groups in PVA promote the resulting conductivity.
3330	Deutetrabenazine (DTBZ) is a US FDA-approved treatment for chorea in Huntington's disease.
3331	The substitution of deuterium for hydrogen at specific positions imparts a longer half-life on DTBZ, allowing for less-frequent daily dosing.
3332	As a reversible vesicular monoamine transporter Type 2 inhibitor, DTBZ depletes monoamines at presynaptic nerve terminals.
3333	DTBZ significantly improved chorea in Huntington's disease patients compared with placebo.
3334	This effect continued in an ongoing open-label extension study in the cohort who switched from tetrabenazine to DTBZ.
3335	Whereas there are currently no head-to-head studies to adequately compare safety profiles between tetrabenazine and DTBZ, an indirect comparison study suggested that the tolerability profile of DTBZ was similar to placebo.
3336	In fact, there are currently no direct comparisons between vesicular monoamine transporter Type 2 inhibitors in humans.
3337	This review will explore DTBZ's pharmacological properties, drug interactions, administration and efficacy.
3338	Pioneer transcription factors play a primary role in establishing competence for gene expression and initiating cellular programming and reprogramming, and their dysregulation causes severe effects on human health, such as promoting tumorigenesis.
3339	Although more than 200 transcription factors are expressed in each cell type, only a small number of transcription factors are necessary to elicit dramatic cell-fate changes in embryonic development and cell-fate conversion.
3340	Among these key transcription factors, a subset called "pioneer transcription factors" have a remarkable ability to target nucleosomal DNA, or closed chromatin, early in development, often leading to the local opening of chromatin, thereby establishing competence for gene expression.
3341	Although more key transcription factors have been identified as pioneer transcription factors, the molecular mechanisms behind their special properties are only beginning to be revealed.
3342	Understanding the pioneering mechanisms will enhance our ability to precisely control cell fate at will for research and therapeutic purposes.
